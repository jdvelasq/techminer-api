In 2017, when the academic finance community was not actively researching FinTech, the editorial team of the Review of Financial Studies launched a competition to develop research proposals focused on this topic. This special issue is the result. In this introductory article, we describe the recent FinTech phenomenon and the novel editorial protocol employed for this special issue following the Registered Reports format.We discuss what we learned from the submitted proposals about the field of FinTech and which ones we selected to be completed and ultimately come out in this special issue. We also provide several observations to help guide future research in the emerging area of FinTech.

It impacts financial institutions, regulators, customers, and merchants across a wide range of industries. Pervasive digital technologies are challenging the fundamentals of the highly regulated financial sector, leading to the emergence of non-traditional payment systems, peer-to-peer money exchanges and increased turbulence in currency markets. This case study explores the development of a FinTech company in China that offers microloans to college students. Five lessons learned are presented for organizations to better manage the challenges and to leverage the opportunities amidst the disruption of financial sector. Our findings also shed light on how digital technology 1) offers the strategic capability for a firm to occupy a market niche in financial sector, 2) enables the generation of alternative credit scores based on non-traditional data, and 3) improves the financial inclusion of previously excluded market segments. © 2016 The Authors","Case study; Ecosystem development; Financial inclusion; FinTech; Online microloan","Commerce; Ecosystems; Peer to peer networks; Product design; Students; Digital technologies; Ecosystem development; Financial inclusions; Financial institution; Financial products; FinTech; Online microloan; Strategic capability; Finance","","","","","","","BBVA Research, Improving credit access for the invisibles, (2015); Burtch G., Ghose A., Wattal S., An empirical examination of the antecedents and consequences of contribution patterns in crowd-funded markets, Information Systems Research, 24, 3, pp. 499-519, (2013); Burtch G., Ghose A., Wattal S., Cultural differences and geography as determinants of online prosocial lending, MIS Quarterly, 38, 3, pp. 773-794, (2014); Citi Group, Digital disruption, how FinTech is forcing banking to a tipping point, (2016); De Reuver M., Verschuur E., Nikayin F., Cerpa N., Bouwman H., Collective action for mobile payment platforms: a case study on collaboration issues between banks and telecom operators, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14, 5, pp. 331-344, (2015); Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Singer D., Oudheusden P.V., The global findex database 2014: Measuring financial inclusion around the world, Policy research working paper 7255, (2015); Foster C., Heeks R., Innovation and scaling of ICT for the bottom-of-the-pyramid, Journal of Information Technology, 28, 4, pp. 296-315, (2013); Gelis P., Why FinTech banks will rule the world, (2016); KPMG, H2 Ventures, Fintech 100: Leading global FinTech innovators report, (2015); Kim G., Shin B., Lee H.G., Understanding dynamics between initial trust and usage intentions of mobile banking, Information Systems Journal, 19, 3, pp. 283-311, (2009); Li B., Dong L., Mode and development of internet finance, Finance in China, 10, pp. 19-21, (2013); Mason J., Qualitative researching, (2002); Michael D.C., Zhou Y., Undersand and tap into China's digital generation, (2011); OECD, Financial education for youth and in schools: Oecd/infe policy guidance challenges and casestudies, (2013); Pan S.L., Tan B., Demystifying case research: A structured-pragmatic-situational (SPS) approach to conducting case studies, Information & Organization, 21, 3, pp. 161-176, (2011); Patton M.Q., Qualitative evaluation and research methods, (1990); Van Campenhout G., Revaluing the role of parents as financial socialization agents in youth financial literacy programs, Journal of Consumer Affairs, 49, 1, pp. 186-222, (2015); Ventura A., Koenitzer M., Stein P., Tufano P., Drummer D., The Future of FinTech: A Paradigm Shift in Small Business Finance, Global Agenda Council on the Future of Financing and Capital, (2015); Walsham G., Interpretive case studies in IS research: Nature and method, European Journal of Information Systems, 4, 2, pp. 74-81, (1995); China Focus: Loans are Doubleedged Sword for College Students, (2016)","Y.

Therefore, FinTech has become a subject of debate among practitioners, investors, and researchers and is highly visible in the popular media. In this study, we unveil the drivers motivating the FinTech phenomenon perceived by the English and German popular press including the subjects discussed in the context of FinTech. This study is the first one to reflect the media perspective on the FinTech phenomenon in the research. In doing so, we extend the growing knowledge on FinTech and contribute to a common understanding in the financial and digital innovation literature. These study contributes to research in the areas of information systems, finance and interdisciplinary social sciences. Moreover, it brings value to practitioners (entrepreneurs, investors, regulators, etc.), who explore the field of FinTech. © 2016, The Author(s).","Content analysis; Digitalization; FinTech; Innovation; Popular press","","","","","","","","Cuesta C., Ruesta M., Tuesta D., Urbiola P., The digital transformation of the banking industry, BBVA Research, (2015); Cukier W., Bauer R., Middleton C., Applying Habermas’ Validity Claims as a Standard for Critical Discourse Analysis, Information Systems Research IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, pp. 233-258, (2004); Cukier W., Ngwenyama O., Bauer R., Middleton C., A critical analysis of media discourse on information technology: preliminary results of a proposed method for critical discourse analysis, Inf Syst J, 19, 2, pp. 175-196, (2009); Dapp T.F., Slomka L., Deutsche Bank A.G., Hoffmann R., Fintech–The Digital (R) Evolution in the Financial Sector.

Furthermore, the number of secure Internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, and the available labor force has a positive impact on the development of this new market segment. Finally, the more difficult it is for companies to access loans, the higher is the number of fintech startups in a country. Overall, the evidence suggests that fintech startup formation need not be left to chance, but active policies can influence the emergence of this new sector. © 2018, The Author(s).","Entrepreneurship; Financial institutions; Fintech; Startups","","","","","","Max Planck Institute for Innovation; Yale University; Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, MPG","Open access funding provided by Max Planck Society.

At the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater – it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation. This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of RegTech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries. © 2017.

However, it is yet to be observed in Latvia to the same extent. This paper aims to evaluate fintech's level of development in Latvia compared to Europe. The paper identifies financial services using innovative technologies offered by fintech companies, analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these services in comparison with services offered by the traditional financial sector companies (banks, insurance companies, institutions involved in asset management and investment, etc.), and evaluates how prepared are consumers to use fintech services. This paper documents the results of the survey aiming to clarify how well-informed consumers in Latvia are about fintech services, their convenience, speed and safety, as well as the consumers' current satisfaction with banking services. The hypothesis of this paper is that Latvian society is not ready to use services provided by fintech, but prefers banking services instead. Survey results provide some evidence in favour of this hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally unaware about fintech services in Latvia and their associated innovations and new financial products. This paper makes several recommendations for managers of fintech enterprises, association of start-up enterprises and risk capital funds as well as state institutions.","Competition; Fintech; Innovation in financial services","","","","","","","","The Future of FinTech and Banking: Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined?, (2015); Anikina I.D., Gukova V.A., Golodova A.A., Chekalkina A.A., Methodological aspects of prioritization of financial tools for stimulation of innovative activities, European Research Studies Journal, 19, 2, pp. 100-112, (2016); Consumers and Mobile Financial Services, (2016); Consumers and Mobile Financial Services, (2015); Chaia A., Goland T., Schiff R., Counting the World's Unbanked, (2010); Opportuities for Mobile Financial Services to Engage Qualitative Research Findings, (2016); Fetai B., Financial integration and financial development: Does financial integration matter?, European Research Studies Journal, 18, 2, pp. 97-106, (2015); Harrison R., Jaumandreu J., Mairesse J., Peters B., Does innovation stimulate employment?

They need to re-evaluate their competitive advantages in light of profound changes driven by advances in information technology (IT) and competitive pressure from FinTech companies. This article emphasizes that banks should not abolish relationship banking, which nurtures close contact with bank customers. A long-term orientation of relationship banking streamlines incentives and supports the long-term needs of bank customers. However, banks might be lured into transaction banking due to the presence of IT-driven economies of scale and competition from FinTech start-ups and IT companies. In this light, the article evaluates the role of distances, artificial intelligence, and behavioral biases. Implications for stability in banking are explored. We argue that relationship banking can overcome its drawbacks, but it needs to adjust to the new reality in order to survive. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; FinTech; Information technology; Relationship banking; The future of banking","","","","","","","","Agarwalben-David S.I., Loan Prospecting and the Loss of Soft Information, Journal of Financial Economics, (2014); Agarwal S., Ben-David I., Yao V., Collateral Valuation and Borrower Financial Constraints: Evidence from the Residential Real Estate Market, Management Science, 61, 9, pp. 2220-2240, (2015); Agarwal S.I., Ben-Davidyao V.W., Systematic Mistakes in the Mortgage Market and Lack of Financial Sophistication, Journal of Financial Economics, (2016); Agarwal S., Chomsisengphet S., Mahoney N., Stroebel J., Regulating Consumer Financial Products: Evidence from Credit Cards, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 130, pp. 111-164, (2014); Agarwal S.J.C., Driscoll X., Gabaixlaibson D., The Age of Reason: Financial Decisions over the Life Cycle and Implications for Regulation, Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Economic Studies Program, the Brookings Institution, 40, 2, pp. 51-117, (2009); Agarwal S., Hauswald R., Distance and Private Information in Lending, Review of Financial Studies, 23, 7, pp. 2757-2788, (2010); Aral S., Dellarocas C., Godes D., Introduction to the Special Issue—Social Media and Business Transformation: A Framework for Research, Information Systems Research, 24, pp. 3-13, (2013); Autor D.H., Dorn D., The Growth of Low-Skill Service Jobs and the Polarization of the US Labor Market, American Economic Review, 103, 5, pp. 1553-1597, (2013); Bapna R., Umyarov A., Do Your Online Friends Make You Pay?

Because it is a new phenomenon, there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the technology's potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization remains unknown. Our study intends to fill that gap. Using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an organization that has effectively implemented it. We identify three affordances of blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized. The process model extends A-A theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchain's use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual adaptation and constraint mitigation. Our study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on A-A theory, blockchain, information technology (IT) implementation, and strategic information systems (SIS). Our study can also help IT practitioners to implement blockchain effectively and extract value from their investment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Actualization; Blockchain; Case study; Experimentation; FinTech; Organizational affordances","Information systems; Actualization; Affordances; Experimentation; FinTech; Information technology implementations; Potential impacts; Strategic impacts; Strategic information systems; Blockchain","","","","","China's NSFC; China’s NSFC; Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71402186, 71402187); Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao, (71529001)","Funding text 1: Funding for this research was provided by China's NSFC Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao (71529001), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71402187, 71402186).; Funding text 2: Funding for this research was provided by China’s NSFC Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese Scholars and Scholars in Hong Kong and Macao ( 71529001 ), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71402187 , 71402186 ).","Abraham C., Junglas I., From cacophony to harmony: a case study about the IS implementation process as an opportunity for organizational transformation at Sentara Healthcare, J.

This evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-office processes. Recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business opportunities and models for financial service companies. Digital Finance encompasses a magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and novel forms of customer communication and interaction—delivered by FinTech companies and innovative financial service providers. Against this backdrop, the research on finance and information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress on the financial sector. Therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in Digital Finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions. Moreover, it gives an outlook on potential future research directions. As a conceptual basis for reviewing this field, the Digital Finance Cube, which embraces three key dimensions of Digital Finance and FinTech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced. This conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of Digital Finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other, and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Digital Finance; e-Finance; FinTech; Future research opportunities; Literature review; State of the art","","","","","","","","Agrawal A., Catalini C., Goldfarb A., Crowdfunding: geography, social networks, and the timing of investment decision, J Econ Manag Strat, 24, 2, pp. 253-274, (2015); Ahlers G.K., Cumming D., Gunther C., Schweizer D., Signaling in equity crowdfunding, Entrep Theory Pract, 39, 4, pp. 955-980, (2015); Allen F., McAndrews J., Strahan P., E-Finance: an introduction, J Financ Serv Res, 22, 1, pp. 5-27, (2002); Allison T.H., Davis B.C., Short J.C., Webb J.W., Crowdfunding in a prosocial microlending environment: examining the role of intrinsic versus extrinsic cues, Entrep Theory Pract, 39, 1, pp. 53-73, (2015); Amit R., Zott C., Crafting business architecture: the antecedents of business model design, Strat Entrep J, 9, 4, pp. 331-350, (2015); Androutsellis-Theotokis S., Spinellis D., A survey of peer-to-peer content distribution technologies, ACM Comput Surv, 36, 4, pp. 335-371, (2004); Antweiler W., Frank M.Z., Is all that talk just noise?

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1                              © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation","","","","","","","","Accenture, Global fintech investment growth continues in 2016 driven by Europe and Asia, accenture study finds, (2016); Agarwal S., Lucca D., Seru A., Trebbi F., Inconsistent regulators: Evidence from banking, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129, 2, pp. 889-938, (2014); Aggarwal R., Stein P., The complex regulatory landscape for FinTech: An Uncertain future for small and medium-sized enterprise lending, (2016); Allan G., Hagiwara Y., Japan regulation shakeup is seen as a game changer for banks, (2018); Allen F., Gale D., Financial intermediaries and markets, Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 72, 4, pp. 1023-1061, (2004); Allen F., Gale D., Understanding financial crises, clarendon lectures in finance, (2007); Allen F., Gale D., Bubbles and crises, The Economic Journal, 110, 460, pp. 236-255, (2000); Allen F., Gale D., Financial contagion, The Journal of Political Economy, 108, 1, pp. 1-33, (2000); Arner D.W., Barberis J.N., Buckley R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the Re- conceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 371-413, (2017); Arner D.W., Barberis J.N., Buckley R.P., The evolution of FinTech: A new post-crisis paradigm?, (2015); Athwal N., ‘Online marketplace lending — Recently misunderstood?, (2016); Balyuk T., Financial innovation and borrowers: Evidence from peer-to-Peer lending, (2017); Banerjee A.V., Mullainathan S., The shape of temptation: Implications for the economic lives of the poor, (2010); Barefoot J.A., Disrupting fintech law, Fintech Law Reporter, 18, 2, pp. 1-18, (2015); Baskerville R., Myers M.D., Special issue on action research in information systems: Making IS research relevant to practice, MIS Quarterly, 28, 3, pp. 329-335, (2004); Bloomberg, A new crop of fintech IPOs will face sceptical investors, (2018); Bower J.L., Christensen C.M., Disruptive technologies: Catching the wave, Harvard Business Review, 73, pp. 43-53, (1995); Braggion F., Manconi A., Zhu H., Is FinTech a threat to financial stability?

However, applying traditional regulatory strategies to new technological ecosystems has proved conceptually difficult. Part of the challenge lies in managing the trade-offs that accompany the regulation of innovations that could, conceivably, both help and hurt consumers as well as market participants. Problems also arise from the common assumption that today's fintech is a mere continuation of the story of innovation that has shaped finance for centuries. This Article offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and regulating fintech by showing how the supervision of financial innovation is invariably bound by what can be described as a policy trilemma. Specifically, we argue that when seeking to provide clear rules, maintain market integrity, and encourage financial innovation, regulators have long been able to achieve, at best, only two out of these three goals. Moreover, today's innovations exacerbate the trade-offs historically embodied in the trilemma by breaking down financial services supply chains into discrete parts and disintermediating traditional functions using cutting edge, but untested, technologies, thereby introducing unprecedented uncertainty as to their risks and benefits. This Article seeks to catalogue the strategies taken by regulatory authorities to navigate the trilemma, and posits them as operating across a spectrum of interrelated responses. The Article then proposes supplemental administrative tools to support not only market, but also regulatory experimentation and innovation. © 2018, Chris Brummer & Yesha Yadav.","","","","","","","","","Chavez-Dreyfuss G., Bitcoin hits another record high in March towards $20,000, Reuters, (2017); Johnson S., Beyond the bitcoin bubble, N.Y.

But the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how they are provided. Regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or ""fintech"") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money itself. These changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance. In particular, this Article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with ""too big to fail"" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small, decentralized financial markets. In many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky behavior by market participants. The Article concludes by sketching out a variety of regulatory responses that better correspond to fintech's particular risks and rewards. © 2017 Vanderbilt Law Review.

As one of the developing countries in the financial sector, China is experiencing an unprecedented level of convergence between finance and technology. This study applies the lens of actor-network theory (ANT) to conduct a multi-level analysis of the historical development of China's financial technology (fintech) industry. It attempts to elucidate the process of building and disrupting a variety of networks comprising heterogeneous actors involved in the newly emerging convergence industry. This research represents a stepping stone in exploring the interaction between fintech and its yet unfolding social and political context. It also discusses policy implications for China's fintech industry, focusing on the changing role of the state in fostering the growth of national industry within and outside of China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Actor network theory; Chinese telecom; Fintech industry; Internet-based service","Developing countries; Finance; Internet; Public policy; Actor network theory; Convergence services; Historical development; Information and communications technology; Internet-based services; Multi-level analysis; Policy implications; Telecom; Social sciences computing","","","","","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, MSIP; Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion, IITP","This work was supported by the ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP.

However, lack of funding and limited distribution channels to reach customers are frequent problems faced by farmers to meet the level of sustainability. Agriculture's sustainability can be strengthened by allowing an innovation of services such as Financial Technology (FinTech), and digital marketplace. Digital marketplace with Fintech enabled might transform agriculture's business process into more sustainable in term of funding and distribution. FinTech offers farmers convenient ways of getting sources of funding through crowdfunding and digital payment system. Thus, digital marketplace can act as a platform for FinTech to integrate the innovative financial solution into broader agriculture's ecosystem. The study proposes a modelling digital marketplace with FinTech enabled especially crowdfunding and payment system in order to support agriculture's sustainability. The model connects all actors (farmers, landowners, investors, and consumers) into a platform that can promote transparency, empowerment, resourcefulness, and public engagement in agriculture. © 2019 The Authors.

The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (FinTech) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FinTech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FinTech innovators. In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and FinTech promotion. The empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. Existing studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to address this issue. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and FinTech promotion. The results confirm that customer trust, data security and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. This research proposes a model called “Intention to adopt FinTech in Germany,” constructs of which were developed based on the TAM and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Findings: The authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in Germany is rapidly increasing; yet the adoption of FinTech is extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FinTech. Further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FinTech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that the FinTech incubators and banks offering FinTech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FinTech. This study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FinTech adoption. Research limitations/implications: There are a few limitations in this study. Initially, this study focuses on FinTech implementation in Germany and not the whole of Europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use FinTech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the FinTech adoption process. Future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the German population. To accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential. The authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to FinTech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies. Practical implications: This study was conducted in Germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment. For instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the United Kingdom, where take-up of FinTech appears to be far greater than in Germany. Therefore, the authors’ results are only generalized for the country of Germany and not other geographical areas. Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FinTech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and FinTech services experience. The authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on FinTech use. Social implications: The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage FinTech innovators in their approach to FinTech and enable FinTech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future. Originality/value: A considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (IT) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in IT remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (Carlson, 2015). Most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance IT. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cyber security; Data security; FinTech; Information security; Mobile banking","Customer satisfaction; Economics; Finance; Investments; Mobile computing; Mobile devices; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Sales; Security of data; User interfaces; Cyber security; Design/methodology/approach; FinTech; Information technology infrastructure; Mobile application securities; Mobile bankings; Technology acceptance model; Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior: organizational behavior and human decision processes, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Allen M.J., Yen W.M., Introduction to Measurement Theory, (2002); Amoroso D.L., Hunsinger D.S., Understanding consumers’ acceptance of online purchasing, Journal of Information Technology Management, 10, 1, pp. 15-41, (2009); Anderson J.C., Gerbing D.C., Structural equation modeling in practice: a review and recommended two-step approach, Psychological Bulletin, 103, 3, pp. 411-423, (1988); Ashley P., Boyd P., Quantitative and qualitative approaches to research in environmental management, Australasian Journal of Environmental Management, 13, 2, pp. 70-78, (2006); Berger J.R., Sasse M.A., Trustbuilders and trustbusters: the role of trust cues in interface to e-commerce applications, (2001); Bland J.M., Altman D.G., Statistics notes: Cronbach’s alpha, BMJ, 314, 7080, (1997); Burns N., Grove S.K., The Practice of Nursing Research: Conduct, Critique, and Utilization, (2001); Carlson J.W., Testimony on behalf of the Fin.

FinTech companies are an important driver of innovation in the financial industry. By making financial transactions more user-friendly and transparent, these firms potentially contribute to financial stability and economic growth. The authors define and categorize the different market segments that have emerged. They further provide an assessment of current market volumes and make forecasts for the next 5, 10 and 20 years. Particular attention is given to the empirical findings resulting from scholarly research. Furthermore, the authors evaluate how the German FinTech market ranks relative to international standards. This book will appeal to finance and entrepreneurship researchers as well as practitioners from banking and tech industries. “This book offers a fresh and fascinating look at the FinTech market. The authors provide a rigorous economic analysis of the FinTech market in Germany and offer many insights that are of interest to practitioners, academics, and policymakers alike.” Professor Douglas Cumming, Schulich School of Business “Germany is one of the fastest growing FinTech markets in Europe.

Few scholars have studied the influence mechanism behind the adoption of Fintech services. This paper proposes an improved technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates user innovativeness, government support, brand image, and perceived risk as determinants of trust to investigate how users adopt Fintech services. We designed a questionnaire, sent it to active customers of the Hefei Science and Technology Rural Commercial Bank, and obtained 387 eligible responses. We analyzed the data with a structural equation model (SEM) to test the hypotheses, including the relationships of all latent variables. The results reveal that users' trust in Fintech services has a very significant influence on users' attitudes for adoption. In addition, perceived ease of use and perceived risk does not affect users' attitudes toward the adoption regarding Fintech services. This study contributes to the literature of the adoption of Fintech services by providing a more comprehensive view of the determinants of users' attitudes by combining trust of Fintech services with TAM. © 2019 by the authors.","Adoption; Fintech services; Technology acceptance model","","","","","","Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project, (16030801121, 17030801001); Key Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71472001, 71571058, 71690235, 91846107)","Funding text 1: Funding: This work is fully supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Nos. 91846107, 71571058, 71690235 and 71472001], and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [Nos. 16030801121 and 17030801001]. and Key Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province under Grant No. SK2017A0443.; Funding text 2: Acknowledgments: This work is fully supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Nos. 91846107, 71571058, 71690235 and 71472001], and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [Nos. 16030801121 and 17030801001], and Key Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province under Grant No. SK2017A0443.","Gabor D., Brooks S., The Digital Revolution in Financial Inclusion: International Development in the Fintech Era, New Polit.

It also predicts that personal and sociodemographic variables (familiarity with robots, age, gender and country) moderate the main relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a web survey of 765 North American, British and Portuguese potential users of robo-advisor services confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for structural equation modeling and multisample analyses of the hypotheses. Findings: Consumers’ attitudes toward robo-advisors, together with mass media and interpersonal subjective norms, are found to be the key determinants of adoption. The influences of perceived usefulness and attitude are slightly higher for users with a higher level of familiarity with robots; in turn, subjective norms are significantly more relevant for users with a lower familiarity and for customers from Anglo-Saxon countries. Practical implications: Banks and other firms in the finance industry should design robo-advisors to be used by a wide spectrum of consumers. Marketing tactics applied should consider the customer’s level of familiarity with robots. Originality/value: This research identifies the key drivers of robo-advisor adoption and the moderating effect of personal and sociodemographic variables. It contributes to understanding consumers’ perceptions regarding the introduction of AI in FinTech. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artificial Intelligence; Finance; Robo-advisors; Robots; Technology adoption","Finance;

This study aims to conduct an in-depth investigation of the banking sector in response to the challenges brought by Fintech startups. Based on the service innovation theory, we propose a novel hybrid multiple criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to evaluate service innovation strategies for improving the sustainability of China's banking industry during the Fintech revolution. A six-dimensional model comprising 20 sub-criteria is constructed and both the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique and DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) are used to explore interrelationships among the indices and their related weights. Finally, the modified VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method is employed to evaluate performance gaps in the four major types of commercial banks in China-state-owned, joint-stock, city commercial banks, and other credit cooperatives-in the field of service innovation. The improvement priorities, ranked from highest to lowest, are new business partners, new service concepts, organizational innovation, technological innovation, new customer interactions, and new revenue models. These results will provide strategies for the sustainable development of China's banking industry and the implementation of changes in response to the impact of the Fintech revolution. © 2019 by the authors.","China's banking industry; DANP; DEMATEL; Fintech; Hybrid MCDM model; Modified VIKOR; Service innovation strategy","China; banking; business development; competition (economics); decision making; financial market; financial services; innovation; laboratory method","","","","","Ningbo University, (2017A10026, YK180011)","This research was sponsored by K.C.

Fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially. It could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces. Yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the European Union (EU). Even the largest fintech market, in China, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation. In the EU, much of fintech is concentrated in the UK. We argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently. (i) Develop a European or national fintech market? (ii) What regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) Should supervision of fintech be exercised at the European level? (iv) What is the overall vision for the EU's financial system? Getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system. In contrast, late action could mean that Europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in Europe. © The Author(s) 2018.

We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden–capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision–all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14–16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders. A quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","FHA; Fintech; Lending; Mortgages; Regulatory arbitrage; Shadow banks","","","","","","","","Acharya V., Richardson M., Van Nieuwerburgh S., White L., Guaranteed to Fail: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Debacle of Mortgage Finance, (2011); Admati A., DeMarzo P., Hellwig M., Pfleiderer P., The leverage ratchet effect, J.

Entrepreneurial endeavours to this end are diverse. Indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies. This study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. It is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in SWIFT's Innotribe competition. We used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. The main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified. Collectively, our results offer new insights into the diversity and range of emergent innovations and technologies that Q2 are transforming the financial services industry worldwide.

Design/methodology/approach: Original data were collected via a survey of 243 participants with Fintech usage experience. The partial least squares method was used to test the proposed model. Findings: The results reveal that legal risk had the most negative effect on the Fintech continuance intention, while convenience had the strongest positive effect. Differences in specific benefit and risk impacts are found between early and late adopters. Originality/value: This empirical study contributes to the novel understanding of the benefit and risk factors affecting the Fintech continuance intention. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention;

In this study we aim to make insights into how the press and other popular media understand and frame FinTech, discussing definitions that represents the meaning of it for the press, and deliver the conceptual framework to be used in research and scientific literature. In doing so, we also identify drivers of FinTech and put them in the context of financial and digital innovation research.

Hundreds of mobile payment services have been introduced across the globe. Strikingly, many of these efforts have failed. This study analyzes whether mobile payment is still relevant in the fintech era. I compare three mobile payment projects – Oi Paggo in Brazil, TCASH in Indonesia, and M-PESA in Kenya – as case studies. I argue that mobile payment systems currently operate in such complex and multidimensional networks with shared common infrastructures and compete for producing and providing value to the customers on the basis of these infrastructures. Three attributes of industry and network structure are immediately of interest: (1) cutting the vertical supply chain more finely may encourage large players to extend their domination, (2) the basic platform continues to be governed by multinational operators (MNOs) – telecom firms, and (3) openness may be decreasing or increasing even as the number of independent parties in the supply chain drops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Case study methods; Developing countries; Financial services; Financial transactions; Fintech; Innovation; Mobile payment; Modularity; Networks; Payment networks; Platforms; Technology ecosystems","Developing countries; Finance; Global system for mobile communications; Networks (circuits); Supply chains; Case study methods; Financial service; Financial transactions; Fintech; Mobile payment; Modularity; Platforms; Technology ecosystem; Electronic money","","","","","","","Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J., Gupta A., Kauffman R.J., Making sense of technology trends in the information technology landscape, MIS Q., 32, 4, pp. 779-809, (2008); Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J., Gupta A., Kauffman R.J., Understanding evolution in technology ecosystems, Commun.

In addition, it analyzed the causal relationship between concern for information privacy and self-efficacy by adopting them as moderating variables. Results suggested that usefulness, ease of use and credibility had an effect on intention to use, and self-efficacy was found to have an moderating effect on independent and dependent variables. Further, concern for information privacy was found to be a factor obstructing the path to intention to use. The implications of this study are that in the promotion of payment-type Fintech services, convenience and usefulness are the most critical and influential variables in terms of usage, while government deregulation and stronger security are called for from an institutional aspect. © Research India Publications.","Elaboration likelihood model; Fintech; K pay; Mobile payment service","","","","","","","","Petty R., Cacioppo J.T., Communication and Persuasion: Central and Peripheral Routes to Attitude Change, (1986); Davis F.D., Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and User Acceptance of Information Technology, MIS Quarterly, 13, 3, pp. 319-340, (1989); Financial Terminology Dictionary, (2015); Schierz P.G., Schilke O., Wirtz B.W., Understanding Consumer Acceptance of Mobile Payment Services: An Empirical Analysis, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 9, 3, pp. 209-216, (2010); Joo Y.J., Chung A.K., Jung Y.J., An Analysis of the Impact of Cyber University Students ‘Mobile Self-efficacy, Mobility on Intention to Use in Mobile Learning Service Linked to E-learning, Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education, 18, 1, pp. 55-68, (2015); Bhattacherjee A., Sanford C., Influence Processes for Information Technology Acceptance: An Elaboration Likelihood Model, MIS Quarterly, 30, 4, pp. 805-825, (2006); Kim Y.H., Choi B.M., Choi J.I., A Study on the Successful Adoption of IOT Services: Focused on iBeacon and Nearby, Korean Journal of Information Technology Services, 14, 3, pp. 217-236, (2015); Lee J.E., Shin M.S., Factors for the Adoption of Smartphone-based Mobile Banking: On User’s Technology Readiness and Expertise, Journal of Society for E-Business Studies, 16, 4, pp. 155-172, (2011); Jarvenpaa S.L., Tractinsky J., Vitale M., Consumer Trust in an Internet Store, Information Technology and Management, 1, 1-2, pp. 45-71, (2000); Chungand S.Y., Park C., Factors Influencing Acceptance of Mobile Service: Moderating Effects of Service Type, Information Systems Review, 9, 1, pp. 23-44, (2007); Foon Y.S., Fah B.C.Y., Internet Banking Adoption in Kuala Lumpur:An Application of UTAUT Model, International Journal of Business and Management, 6, 4, (2011); Van Slyke C., Shim J.T., Johnson R., Jiang J.J., Concern for Information Privacy and Online Consumer Purchasing, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 7, 1, pp. 415-444, (2006); Bandura A., Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control.

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. Methods: To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Results: Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Conclusions: Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious. © 2017, The Author(s).","Banks; Digital banking; Finance; FinTech; Innovation; Retail banks; Start-ups; Stock returns; Technology; Venture capital","","","","","","","","Aaker D., Keller K., Consumer Evaluations of Brand Extensions, Journal of Marketing, pp. 27-41, (1990); Afuah A., Utterback J., Responding to Structural Industry Changes: A Technological Evolution Perspective, Industrial and Corporate Change, pp. 183-202, (1997); Benner M., The incumbent discount: Stock market categories and response to radical technological change, Academy of Management Review, pp. 703-720, (2007); Blitz D., Hanauer M., van Vliet P., Five Conerns with the Five-Factor Model, (2016); Buchack G., Matvos G., Piskorski T., Seru A., Fintech, Regulatory Arbitrage, and the Rise of Shadow Banks, (2017); Cannon S., Summers L., How Uber and the Sharing Economy Can Win over Regulators, (2014); Chishti S., Barberis J., The FinTech Book, (2016); Christensen C., The innovator's dilemma: when new technologies cause great firms to fail, (1997); Davila A., Foster G., Gupta M., Venture capital financing and the growth of startup firms, Journal of Business Venturing, pp. 689-708, (2003); Davis J.L., Fama E.F., French K.R., Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns: 1929 to 1997, The Journal of Finance, pp. 389-406, (2000); Dean B., Giglierano J., Multistage financing of technical start-up companies in silicon valley, Journal of Business Venturing, pp. 375-389, (1990); Demos T., Loans for Weddings: Fintech Learns to Focus, (2016); Dickerson J., Masood S., Skan J., The Future of Fintech and Banking: Digitally disrupted or reimagined?, (2015); Dunkley E., Lending services revolution piles pressure on banks as fintech sector grows, (2015); Ernst, Young, Landscaping UK Fintech, (2014); Fama E.F., French K.R., Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds, Journal of Financial Economics, pp. 3-56, (1993); Fama E.F., French K.R., The Capital Asset Pricing Model: Theory and Evidence, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, pp. 25-46, (2004); Fama E.F., French K.R., A five-factor asset pricing model, Journal of Financial Economics, pp. 1-22, (2015); Ferrari R., FinTech Impact on Retail Banking – From a Universal Banking Model to Banking Verticalization, The FinTech Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries, pp. 248-252, (2016); Frank R., Microeconomics and Behavior, (2009); Goh K., Kauffman R., Firm strategy and the Internet in U.S. commercial banking, Journal of Management Information Systems, pp. 9-40, (2013); Hannan T.H., McDowell J.M., The Determinants of Technology Adoption: The Case of the Banking Firm, The RAND Journal of Economics, pp. 328-335, (1984); Hayashi Y., Consumer Watchdog Chief Sees Role for Fintech in Payday Lending, The Wallstreet Journal, (2016); Huang D., Banks and Fintech Firms’ Relationship Status: It’s Complicated, (2015); Jegadeesh N., Titman S., Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency, The Journal of Finance, pp. 65-91, (1993); Juengerkes B.E., FinTechs and Banks – Collaboration is Key, The FinTech Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries, pp. 179-182, (2016); Jun J., Yeo E., Entry of FinTech Firms and Competition in the Retail Payments Market, Asia-Pacific Journal of Financial Studies, pp. 159-184, (2016); Kauffman R., Liu J., Ma D., Competition, Cooperation and Regulation: Understanding the Evolution of the Mobile Payments Technology Ecosystem, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, pp. 372-391, (2015); Kaul A., Technology and Corporate Scope: Firm and Rival Innovation as Antecedents of Corporate Transactions, Strategic Management Journal, pp. 347-367, (2012); The Pulse of Fintech, 2015 in Review, (2016); Laven M., Bruggink D., How FinTech is transforming the way money moves around the world: An interview with Mike Laven, Journal of Payments Strategy & Systems, pp. 6-12, (2016); Lin Z., Whinston A., Fan S., Harnessing Internet finance with innovative cyber credit management, Financial Innovation, 1, 5, (2015); Liu K., Miller D., Creative Destruction: Evidence From Initial Public Offerings, (2014); Mina A., Lahr H., Hughes A., The demand and supply of external finance for innovative firms, Industrial and Corporate Change, pp. 869-901, (2013); Peters G.W., Panayi E., Understanding Modern Banking Ledgers Through Blockchain Technologies: Future of Transaction Processing and Smart Contracts on the Internet of Money, (2015); PwC, Blurred lines: How FinTech is shaping Financial Services, (2016); Sharpe W.F., Capital asset prices: A theory of market equilibrium under conditions of risk, The Journal of Finance, pp. 425-442, (1964); Sood A., Tellis G., Do Innovations Really Pay Off?

Analysing these records shows that (i) current research on FinTech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all. © 2018 The Authors.

The recent proliferation of the mobile payment sector led by innovative mobile Fintech payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay is the most important and fastest growing Fintech services from consumers’ perspective. Although businesses have been making efforts to spread the use of the services, security is crucial in the diffusion of the services. Despite the importance, the role of perceived security in continuous intention to use mobile, Fintech services has not yet been investigated in depth. Thus, this study investigates the relationships between perceived security, knowledge regarding the services, confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction. We propose a research model using an extended post-acceptance model (EPAM) as a theoretical framework in the context of Fintech services. We then validate the model using the data collected from the service users. The analyzed results show that knowledge and perceived security in mobile Fintech services have a significant influence on users’ confirmation and perceived usefulness. However, perceived security does not directly influence users’ satisfaction and continual intention to use. We further find significant relationships among confirmation, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and continual intention to use of the services. We discuss theoretical and practical contributions of the study. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","Electronic money; Acceptance models; Emerging technologies; Empirical studies; Intention to use;

Especially, because of rapidly growing online market and supply of mobile devices, the need for mobile Fintech payment service that enables easy online and off-line payment has increased. According to the 2013 report by market research company Gartner, purchase related global mobile payment market size was predicted to grow from $45.1 billion in 2012 to $224.3 billion in 2017 with average annual growth of 38%. The study will surveyed the recent trends of mobile Fintech payment services and categorized them based on the service forms to suggest requirements and security challenges so that better and securer service can be provided in the future. First, the study defined existing payment services and Fintech payment services by comparing them, and analyzed recent mobile Fintech payment services to classify mobile Fintech payment service providers into Hardware makers, Operating System makers, payment platform providers, and financial institutions to show their common features. Finally it defined requirements that mobile Fintech payment services must meet and security challenges that future and present mobile Fintech payment services will encounter in the perspective of mutual authentication, authorization, integrity, privacy, and availability. Through the suggested study, it is expected that mobile Fintech payment services will develop into more secure services in the future. © 2018, The Author(s).","Finance technology; Fintech; Mobile payment; Security challenges","Authentication; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile telecommunication systems; Average annual growth; Financial institution; Market researches; Mobile payment; Mobile payment market; Mutual authentication; Offline payments; Security challenges; Fintech","","","","","Baewha Women’s University","This work was financially supported by Baewha Women’s University.","Lee A.R., Ahn H.Y., Fintech users’ information privacy concerns and user resistance: investigating the interaction effect with regulatory focus, J Korea Inst Inf Secur Cryptol, 26, 1, pp. 209-226, (2016); Park S.W., Lee I.Y., Anonymous authentication scheme based on NTRU for the protection of payment information in NFC mobile environment, J Inf Process Syst, 9, pp. 461-476, (2013); Thakur R., Srivastava M., Adoption readiness, personal innovativeness, perceived risk and usage intention across customer groups for mobile payment services in India, Internet Res, 24, 3, pp. 369-392, (2014); Dahlberg T., Guo J., Ondrus J., A critical review of mobile payment research, Electron Commer Res Appl, 14, 5, pp. 265-284, (2015); Jose Liebana-Cabanillas F., Sanchez-Fernandez J., Munoz-Leiva F., Role of gender on acceptance of mobile payment, Ind Manag Data Syst, 114, 2, pp. 220-240, (2014); Perez A.J., Zeadally S., Jabeur N., Security and privacy in ubiquitous sensor networks, J Inf Process Syst, 14, pp. 286-308, (2018); Yang S., Et al., Mobile payment services adoption across time: an empirical study of the effects of behavioral beliefs, social influences, and personal traits, Comput Hum Behav, 28, 1, pp. 129-142, (2012); Capgemini R., World Payments Report 2016, (2016); Gulamhuseinwala I., Bull T., Lewis S., FinTech is gaining traction and young, high-income users are the early adopters, J Financ Perspect, 3, 3, pp. 16-23, (2015); Han Y.H., Lim H.K., Gil J.M., Hierarchical location caching scheme for mobile object tracking in the internet of things, J Inf Process Syst, 13, pp. 1410-1429, (2017); Steeves D., The Social Impact of FinTech in Nigeria, The FinTech Book, pp. 78-80, (2016); Zavolokina L., Dolata M., Schwabe G., The FinTech phenomenon: antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press, Hum Centric Comput Inf Sci, 2, (2016); Li Y., Spigt R., Swinkels L., The impact of FinTech start-ups on incumbent retail banks’ share prices, Hum Centric Comput Inf Sci, 3, (2017); Lee S.H., Lee D.W., Review on Fintech Industry in Oversea, (2016); Skan J., Et al., The Boom in Global Fintech Investment, (2014); Park Y.J., Jang S.M., Understanding privacy knowledge and skill in mobile communication, Comput Hum Behav, 38, pp. 296-303, (2014); Liang X., Et al., Security and privacy in mobile social networks: challenges and solutions, IEEE Wirel Commun, 21, 1, pp. 33-41, (2014); Smalley S., Craig R., Security enhanced (SE) android: Bringing flexible MAC to android, Proceedings of the NDSS, 2013, (2013); Li Q., Clark G., Mobile security: a look ahead, IEEE Secur Priv, 11, 1, pp. 78-81, (2013); Kadhiwal S., Zulfiquar A.U.S., Analysis of mobile payment security measures and different standards, Comput Fraud Secur, 2007, 6, pp. 12-16, (2007); Linck K., Pousttchi K., Wiedemann D.G., Security Issues in Mobile Payment from the Customer Viewpoint, pp. 1-11, (2006); Zhou T., An empirical examination of continuance intention of mobile payment services, Decis Support Syst, 54, 2, pp. 1085-1091, (2013); Cheong C.P., Fong S., Lei P., Chatwin C.R., Young R.C., Designing an efficient and secure credit cardbased payment system with web services based on the ANSI X9.59-2006, J Inf Process Syst, 8, pp. 495-520, (2012); Ondrus J., Pigneur Y., An assessment of NFC for future mobile payment systems, International Conference on The.

We find that most FinTech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable. For the overall financial sector, internet of things (IoT), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types. Innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

FinTech and the integration of FinTech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, SDG 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social SDGs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources. Important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that FinTech holds in this context. Mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building. Rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer FinTech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","agroindustry; capacity building; developing world; digitization; infrastructural development; natural resource; profitability; sustainability; sustainable development; trade-off","","","","","NWO-WOTRO, (W08.250.203)","This work was supported by NWO-WOTRO [project ‘Information transparency system as a low-cost scalable solution to farmers’ access to credit and services in Ghana’, Application number W08.250.203].

However, relevant studies are rare and there is no consensus on the optimal indicator system for sustainable development. Therefore, this study proposes an indicator system to evaluate sustainability and conducts in-depth analysis of the relationship between FinTech and sustainable development based on data of peer-to-peer platforms (P2P) in 31 Chinese provinces. The empirical results show the existence of a U-shaped relationship between FinTech and sustainable development, mainly determined by the pattern of extensive economic growth. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that there are significant regional differences in its impact on sustainable development, being significant in China's eastern and central regions and insignificant in the western region; moreover, the impact on the central region is significantly higher than that on the eastern region. Our research not only has strong practical significance but also contributes significantly to the literature on FinTech and sustainable development. © 2019 by the authors.","Consumption emission; Economic growth; Environmental governance; Financial technology; Peer-to-peer; Social development; Sustainable development","China; economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental legislation; financial system; heterogeneity; literature review; optimization; social development; sustainability; sustainable development","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71473169, 71673194, 71742004); Sichuan University, SCU; Graduate Student's Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, (2018YJSY001)","Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Nos. 71742004, 71673194, and 71473169 for D.X. and the Graduate Student’s Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, Grant No.2018YJSY001 for C.X.

Leveraging digital technologies to offer innovative services, FinTech start-ups are emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance. Despite increasing investments, the FinTech phenomenon is low on theoretical insights. So far, the offerings of FinTech start-ups have been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective. As a functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the offerings of FinTech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional characteristics. Thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented FinTech start-ups. Our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along the perspectives interaction, data, and monetization. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227 FinTech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a cluster analysis. Our taxonomy contributes to the descriptive knowledge on FinTech start-ups, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze the service offerings of FinTech start-up in a structured manner. © 2017, The Author(s).","Business model;

This paper explores the complexity of Fintech, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term Fintech and covering a period of more than 40 years. The objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application. As the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of Fintech using both spheres. Applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peerreviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that Fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities. The implications as well as the shortcomings of this definition are discussed. © 2021 Journal of Innovation Management.

Financial technologies (FinTech) have become an integral part of banking, and nowadays banks have started to compete beyond financial services facing increasing competition from nonfinancial institutions providing, for example, payment services. Start-up service providers, search engines, and social networks have expanded their services ""interfering"" in the fields traditionally covered by banks. The rapid rise of FinTech has changed the business landscape in banking asking for more innovative solutions. These recent tendencies require the banks to increase investment in FinTech, rethink service distribution channels, especially the business-to-consumers models, increase further standardization of backoffice functions, etc. Some members of the financial services industry see the boom in FinTech as a threat to traditional banking industry. Others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility, better functionality in some areas, and aggregation of services. The aim of the paper is to analyze the recent trends in banking, identifying opportunities and risks of FinTech for banks. A timely integration of FinTech into business allows banks to get an advantage in growing competition. This paper provides an extensive analysis of recent trends in FinTech and banking, examining experience of leading European and US banks, as well as surveys conducted among members of the financial services industry in different countries. The authors have studied the development of the financial innovation and technology market, assessed the existing practices applied in the field of FinTech, identified the main risks related to development of FinTech and financial innovations the banks are exposed to on the micro- and macrolevel. The paper provides recommendations for regulators and banks to ensure reduction of risks associated with development of FinTech. Analysis of FinTech market has shown growing competition, including from nonfinancial institutions. The paper provides practical recommendations to commercial banks for strengthening the position in financial innovations and controlling the risks associated with introduction of financial innovations.

In particular, the study analyses the systemic innovation nature of FinTech-based innovations. The main contribution of this research study is the development of systemic innovation model which can be used as a dynamic tool to track the progress and pattern of technology development and diffusion. The research also discusses the latest financial innovation of PromptPay FinTech – the e-payment system in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses the case study approach to analyse the systemic innovation characteristics of FinTech-based innovations. This research offers a new systemic innovation model which is developed and can be used as a dynamic tool to track the progress and pattern of technology development and diffusion. The study uses FinTech-based innovations as case study samples to gain a better understanding concerning the systemic characteristics and the pattern of technology diffusion under the analytical framework of systemic innovation model. This research involves qualitative interviews with five major commercial banks in the financial services industry of Thailand. Findings: The analyses of findings show the systemic characteristics of FinTech-based innovations in the banking industry, both at a global scale and Thailand case. The analyses have shown that systemic characteristics of the innovation process are the outcome of interactions between the complexity of the innovation and the capabilities of innovators in managing the innovation. The insightful implications on the systemic nature of innovation give the trend and direction of FinTech-based innovation development in the banking industry. Originality/value: The main contribution which shows originality and value of this paper is the development of systemic innovation model. This research study develops a systemic innovation model to analyse the systemic characteristics which can be applied to all innovations in any industry. The model can also help track the progress and pattern of technology development and diffusion. Therefore, the model can be used to project the trend and diffusion of innovation competition in the banking industry. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Economic forecasting; Innovation; Strategy","","","","","","SWIFT; Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication","For many decades, banks invest heavily in technology in attempts to improve the efficiency of the financial innovation system. The banking landscape has witnessed the development of various FinTech-based innovations like electronic fund transfer at the point-of-sale (EFTPOS), automated teller machine (ATM cash dispenser), internet banking, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (or SWIFT) international electronic fund transfer, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), mobile banking, Bitcoin wallet, Blockchain banking, crowd funding. The objective of this research study is to understand the diffusion process of financial technology or FinTech in the financial services industry. In particular, the study explores the systemic characteristics underlying FinTech-based innovations in the banking industry. The research aims to highlight the extent to which these systemic characteristics would influence the collaborative network solutions and the level of technology diffusion.","Abernathy W.J., Clark K.B., Kantrow A.M., Industrial Renaissance: Producing a Competitive Future for America, (1983);

The industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer experience, and approaches that result in services transformation. Industry and academic observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes, with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer centricity, and informedness. The long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the “Fintech Revolution” is at stake. We present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services. We discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology innovations that have begun to leverage the execution and stakeholder value associated with payments, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and cross-border payments; multiple innovations that have affected lending and deposit services, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and social media use; issues with respect to investments, financial markets, trading, risk management, robo-advisory and services influenced by blockchain and fintech innovations.

We compare loans made by LendingClub and similar loans that were originated by banks. The correlations between the rating grades (assigned by LendingClub) and the borrowers’ FICO scores declined from about 80% (for loans originated in 2007) to about 35% for recent vintages (originated in 2014–2015), indicating that nontraditional data (not already accounted for in the FICO scores) have been increasingly used by fintech lenders. The rating grades perform well in predicting loan default. The use of alternative data has allowed some borrowers who would have been classified as subprime by traditional criteria to be slotted into “better” loan grades, allowing them to obtain lower priced credit. © 2019 Financial Management Association International","alternative data; fintech; LendingClub; marketplace lending; P2P lending; peer-to-peer lending; shadow banking","","","","","","Central Bank Research Association; European Financial Management Association; NYU Fintech; American Economic Association, AEA","The authors thank Leigh-Ann Wilkins, Erik Dolson, Raman Quinn Maingi, and John Nguyen for their research assistance.
