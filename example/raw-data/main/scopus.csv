However, its implementation still sparks many legal problems and presents challenges for digital law in Indonesia. This study aims to study the challenges faced by Indonesian digital law due to the growth of the online loan business and to explore how the prospects of the online loan (fintech) business in improving the economic conditions of the Indonesian people. This research used empirical juridical methods, a case, and a statutory approach. The results showed that the challenges faced by Indonesian law in anticipating the growth of online businesses tainted by various legal cases require a more comprehensive rule of law in the form of legislation, thereby supporting the growth of prospects of the online loan business in an effort to improve the economy of the people of the state. © 2022, University of Muhammadiyah Malang.

Recently, increasing attention has been focused on proposing reliable indicators to quantify financial inclusion by country. In this research, we adopt a composite index approach for that purpose. The main distinguishing feature of our empirical exercise is its data-driven spirit; in particular, we make very few assumptions about the nature of the composite index. Moreover, we define financial inclusion from three main dimensions making use of both demand and supply side data and recognize that financial technology and digital finance are playing an increasing role in boosting financial inclusion. Next, we analyze financial inclusion changes over time by distinguishing between catching-up and environment change effects. The latter allows us to verify whether policy makers have succeeded in creating an environment that has fostered financial inclusion and quantify the scope for policy interventions. Finally, we take the heterogeneity between countries into consideration by partitioning countries into income per capita categories. Our empirical exercise reveals important patterns useful in understanding financial inclusion differences and designing future policy implementations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Composite index; Economic development; Financial inclusion; Financial technology; Heterogeneity gaps","economic development; financial market; financial system; policy implementation; technological change; technological development","","","","","","","Allen F., Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Martinez Peria M., The foundations of financial inclusion: understanding ownership and use of financial accounts, J Financ Intermed, 27, 1, pp. 1-30, (2016); Ang J.B., Kumar S., Financial development and barriers to the cross-border diffusion of financial innovation, J Bank Finance, 39, pp. 43-56, (2014); Bahadir B., Valev N., Financial development convergence, J Bank Finance, 56, pp. 61-71, (2015); Baltagi B.H., Demetriades P., Law S.H., Financial development and openness: evidence from panel data, J Dev Econ, 89, pp. 285-296, (2009); Beck T., Demirguc-Kunt A., Martinez Peria M., Reaching out: access to and use of banking services across countries, J Financ Econ, 85, pp. 234-266, (2007); Beck T., Demirguc-Kunt A., Honohan P., Access to financial services: measurement, impact, and policies, World Bank Res Obs, 24, 1, pp. 119-145, (2009); Camara N., Tuesta D., Measuring financial inclusion: A multidimensional index, The Role of Data in Supporting Financial Inclusion Policy, 47, (2018); Measuring Financial Inclusion: An Axiomatic Approach.

Nonetheless, the flourishing of financial technology and the strengthening of financial regulation change the financial industry, which may lead to new images. Based on 2665 A-share listed Chinese firms, this study examines the impact of financial structure on enterprise-level technological innovation and the moderating effect of financial technology and regulation. This study demonstrates that the market-based evolution of financial structure is based on two ways to increase the quantity and improve the quality of technological innovation. One is to increase investment, and the other is to improve the input–output innovation efficiency. Financial technology and regulation individually weaken but collectively strengthen the positive impact of the market-based evolution of financial structure. Banks rapidly implement advanced technology and are more tightly regulated. The collaborative development of technology and regulation promotes the financial market's innovation support functions. Heterogeneities, such as internal governance and external supervision, lead to mixed results. This paper lends support for countries with less developed financial systems to embrace reforms in their financial structure, financial technology, and financial regulation. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Financial regulation; Financial structure; Financial technology; Technological innovation","China; Commerce; Financial markets; Chinese firms; Financial industry; Financial regulations; Financial structures; Financial technology; Innovation efficiency; Input-output; Moderating effect; Technological innovation; Two ways; finance; industrial enterprise; innovation; regulatory framework; technological development; technology adoption; Investments","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LQ20G030002); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (18ZDA093)","Funding text 1: Chengsi Zheng , associate professor, Ph.D. in economics of Hubei University, deputy dean of School of Finance and Trade, Wenzhou Business College in China.

A theoretical framework was developed from a blend of the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework and the human, organization, and technology (HOT) fit model. The best-worst method was used to analyze and rank the identified barriers and challenges of fintech according to their weighted averages. The findings of the study point to perceived risk and lack of trust; transaction cost; privacy and security issues; legal and regulatory barriers; and the human element and psychological factors as the highest ranked barriers and challenges of financial technology. This study has significant theoretical and managerial implications for academia, policy makers, and practitioners, as it would stretch their standpoints on the best practices for adoption and implementation of fintech modernisms. © 2023, IGI Global.

The data were sourced from the Global Financial Inclusion Index, the Global Financial Development Database and the World Development Indicator on the World Bank website in research periods of 2011, 2014, 2017 and 2021 with a total of 500 observations from 125 countries. Panel data econometric techniques employed are pooled least square, fixed effect and random effect model. We find that financial technology adoption is positively associated with the financial sector and overall valuation on business climate. While social conditions have a negative significant effect, the non financial sector has no effect on financial technology adoption. Financial sector intervention through financial technology has become a new instrument which triggers financial growth and helps realize financial inclusion more quickly. Financial inclusion is one element of financial growth and development which is generally measured by the scope and ease of access to financial services in a country. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.","across Countries; Economic Growth; FinTech; Panel Regression; UTAUT","","","","","","","","Astuti Y., OJK Pede Inklusi Keuangan RI Bisa Salip Singapura & Thailand, (2020); Keuangan Otoritas Jasa, Peraturan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, (2022); Mengenal Financial Teknologi, Departemen Komunikasi Bank Sentral Republik Indonesia, (2018); Sukirno, Dampak Fintech terhadap ekonomi Indonesia capai Rp25,97 Triliun, Alinea.Id, (2018); Deng Huang, Cheng, FinTech and Sustainable Development: Evidence from China based on P2P Data, Sustainability, 11, 22, (2019); Maier E., Supply and demand on crowdlending platforms: connecting small and medium-sized enterprise borrowers and consumer investors, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 33, pp. 143-153, (2016); Rusdianasari F., Peran Inklusi Keuangan melalui Integrasi Fintech dalam Stabilitas Sistem Keuangan Indonesia, (2018); Financial Inclusion on the Rise, But Gaps Remain, Global Findex Database Shows, (2018); World Develompent Indicators, (2021); Dwivedi Y.

Firstly, by analyzing scientific and technological innovation, the authors design four characteristics: The number of theses, the quantity and quality of projects, the level of technology transformation, and the value of commercialization. Then, according to the above features, a feature processing method based on improved attention mechanism is proposed to deeply explore the internal relationship between the four features. Finally, a performance evaluation method is used based on the temporal convolution network (TCN) that can predict the performance of scientific and technological innovation by inputting enhanced features. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed method can reach 0.846, 0.869, and 0.851 in terms of the precision, recall, and H value, respectively, which can help enterprises predict the performance and improve the electronic convenience of enterprises. © 2023 IGI Global.

Theoretical Framework: There is relatively little literature now accessible to examine the degree of consumer acceptance of Financial Technology products and services. The field of financial technology still requires a lot of research and education, though. Design/Methodology/Approach: A comprehensive evaluation of the literature served as the basis for the research design. Data gathering techniques include non-probability sampling (quota sampling). Users of particular Financial Technology products and services are queried using a standardised questionnaire to gather data. The 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh state were used as the source of the samples. Findings: The data is analysed using techniques such as regression and Anova. The frequency of use, level of satisfaction, level of awareness, the intended use of the Fintech, the satisfaction with the intended use and the user's behavioural intention to use the Fintech all statistically significantly correlate with the user's level of acceptance in using the chosen Financial Technology products and services. Research, Practical & Social implications: This study determined the degree to which users accepted particular Financial Technology goods and services from diverse angles. Originality/Value: This study aims to identify and quantify the effects of numerous variables on users' degree of acceptability of Fintech, including frequency of use, awareness and satisfaction levels, as well as the use of Fintech for specific purposes and behavioural intentions. Internet banking, NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, mobile banking, electronic wallets, stock trading applications, peer-to-peer lending applications, crowd funding, cash deposit machines, ATMs, and credit rating applications are the 12 Financial Technology products used in the study. © AOS-Estratagia and Inovacao.

Fintech disruption is a deviation from the norm, resulting in a significant shift in banking services and, as a result, risk. This article aims to investigate how Fintech has influenced recent changes in the banking industry and upcoming challenges, with a particular emphasis on blockchain technology. We perform a comprehensive thematic analysis of recent studies on Fintech in the banking industry. We found that Fintech has enormous potential to grow and impact the banking industry and the entire world. The banking industry could benefit from combining emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, machine learning, or other decision-making layers. However, with the benefits come drawbacks, such as increased reliance on technology, high costs, increased job losses, security risks related to data and fraud, and so on. The use of emerging technology and collaboration between Fintech firms and banks can improve system-wide financial stability while minimising the negative externalities of disruption and competition. These findings can help regulators, policymakers, academics, and practitioners understand the opportunities and challenges of emerging technologies in the banking industry. © 2022 by the authors.","banking;

This paper uses the Sentence Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Sent-LDA) topic model to comprehensively identify risk factors in the fintech industry based on textual risk factors disclosed in Form 10-K. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the importance of risk factors and the similarities of the risk factors for the whole fintech industry and different fintech sub-sectors from the perspectives of risk factor types and risk factor contents. In the empirical analysis, 53,452 risk factor headings of 34 fintech companies included in the KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index (KFTX) over the period 2015–2019 are collected. The empirical results show that 20 risk factors of the fintech industry are identified. However, the important risk factors vary differently among different fintech sub-sectors. For the analysis of risk factor similarity, mean values of similarity of risk factor types and the similarity of risk factor contents both increased from 2015 to 2019, which indicates that the risks faced by fintech companies are becoming increasingly similar. The mean value of similarity of risk factor contents is 42.13%, while the mean value of similarity of risk factor types is 80.93%. Thus, although the types of risk factors faced by different fintech companies are similar, the contents of risk factors disclosed by different companies are still quite different. The comprehensive identification of fintech risk factors lays an important foundation for the further measurement and management of risks in the fintech industry. In the feature, we will further make effective risk estimations of the fintech industry based on the identified fintech risk factors. © 2022 by the authors.

The use of financial technology comes with widely documented advantages, however, the increasing diversity of financial technology products available is found to have complicated many people in emerging economies. The availability of information has made it easier for people to make irresponsible financial decisions, which have resulted in higher levels of debt. While teachers play a meaningful role in financial literacy education, research points out they still need to undergo financial literacy education themselves in order to improve their financial management expertise, more so in the digital era. A scientific questionnaire was distributed to 246 high school teachers who were chosen on a probability basis using systematic random sampling. The research data were subject to correlation analysis. The results show that high school teachers have a good grasp of financial technology, and they possess strong financial literacy skills. The correlation analysis indicated that financial literacy skills are the most important attribute influencing financial behavior of high school teachers.  © 2023 Jali et al.","Financial behaviour; Financial education; Financial literacy; Financial literacy challenges; Financial technology; High school teachers","","","","","","","","Agustina Y., The Influence of Financial Literacy, Work Experience and Income on Financial Behavior of Students of the Faculty of Economics, University of Muhammadiyah Gresik, (2016); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organizational behavior and human decision processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Broken and unequal: The state of education in South Africa, (2020); Ballantine J.

Fintech adoption has been delayed in some places, particularly in the Middle East, despite the potential positive benefits. This study investigates the mediating effect of perceived ease of use on the relationship between seamless transactions, financial risk, legal risk, security risk, perceived risk, and the intention to use financial technology in Middle Eastern countries. Data was collected from 500 respondents from five Middle Eastern countries (Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates) using a structured questionnaire, and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the research model. The findings demonstrate that perceived ease of use strongly mediates the links between seamless trans-actions, financial risk, legal risk, security risk, perceived risk, and the intention to use financial technology. The study shed light on the significance of perceived ease of use in influencing peo-ple's intention to utilize financial technology as well as the function it serves in minimizing the effects of perceived risks. The findings of this study could be useful for financial technology companies operating in Middle Eastern countries, policymakers, and researchers interested in the adoption of financial technology. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","FinTech; Middle Eastern countries; Perceived Ease; PLS-SEM","","","","","","","","Al-Emran M., Mezhuyev V., Kamaludin A., Towards a conceptual model for examining the impact of knowledge management factors on mobile learning acceptance, Technology in Society, 61, (2020); Alhashmi S.

Based on city-level data from 2011 to 2021 in China, this paper used the super-efficiency SBM model with embedded non-expected output and the GML index method to measure the GTFP levels of 283 prefecture-level and above cities and to empirically test the impact of fintech on GTFP and its underlying mechanisms. The empirical results showed that the development of fintech had significantly promoted the improvement of GTFP, and the effect was dynamically stable. Specifically, fintech had a stronger and more significant incentive effect on GTFP in its more mature stage of development. By decomposing fintech into two dimensions, it was found that the depth of fintech development had a stronger impact on GTFP with dynamic superimposed characteristics. Mechanism analysis showed that fintech development can drive the progress of GTFP by improving resource allocation efficiency, optimizing human capital, and incentivizing technological innovation channels. Moderating effect analysis revealed that financial regulation and environmental regulation have a positive moderating effect on the baseline relationship between fintech and GTFP. Further research found that the moderating effects of financial regulation and environmental regulation exhibit significant nonlinear threshold characteristics, and the driving effect of fintech on GTFP can only reach its maximum when both are within the optimal range. This study provides valuable insights for the development and optimization of fintech, the green transformation of the real economy, and high-quality development. © 2023 by the authors.","environmental regulation; financial regulation; financial technology; green total factor productivity","China; artificial intelligence; environmental technology; incentive; index method; innovation; optimization; regulatory approach; resource allocation; technological development; total factor productivity","","","","","National Social Science Fund Youth Project, (20CJY065); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (22BJY168)","This research received was funded by The National Social Science Fund of China, grant number 22BJY168, and National Social Science Fund Youth Project, grant number 20CJY065.","Song D., Zhang Q., Evolution and Driving Forces of the Integration of Environmental Protection and Economic High-Quality Development, J.

The results obtained are: (1) Financial inclusion through the credit variable and the number of ATMs, and fintech through the e-money variable, contributed to the most significant increase in GDP in the ASEAN-5 countries. Meanwhile, the most critical contributor to reduction in the unemployment rate from financial inclusion is through the credit and savings variables, while from fintech it is through mobile phone subscriptions. (2) Thailand is the country that has most effectively influenced the economic fundamental of unemployment rate, while Indonesia is the country that has most effectively influenced the economic fundamental of GDP. The results obtained from the panel regression model and cross-sectional weighting indicate that financial inclusion through savings, credit, and number of ATMs, and fintech through cellular phone subscription, are effective in reducing poverty rates in the ASEAN-5 countries.

Using a Likert scale questionnaire, the cross-sectional technique collects primary data. This study employed a partial least square-structural equation model for the analysis of research data and empirical contribution to literature. According to the conclusions of this study, sharia fintech management can be enhanced by enhancing user happiness, sharia risk management, innovation management, fintech security, and sharia complaint management. This study's model is founded on the major constructs drawn from the context of the sharia fintech paradigm. The sharia fintech model produced by this research contributes significantly to the body of knowledge. The finding has significant theoretical consequences that are novel to this kind of knowledge. The practical consequences of this study include a means to enhance the management of sharia-compliant fintech in Indonesia. This research has produced a new model, yet the model has several drawbacks. Future directions for this research include adding additional linkages and expanding knowledge of the sharia fintech model. © 2022 asociación Cuadernos de economía.

This represents a challenge for Islamic finance considered as an alternative finance especially after the advent of the 2009 global financial crisis. Islamic finance certainly has an important market share in crowdfunding and also in microfinance, and its role in the financing of SMEs all over the world is not negligible, and this financial crisis should therefore pose different challenges to Islamic finance. It requires a set of instruments specific to its category, and also needs new technologies (FinTech), strategies and financial services to cope with the possible phenomenon. Our work seeks to present how Islamic finance, with its specific financing instruments, can fight against the disastrous effects of this health crisis, in particular the instruments of Zakat, funding by Qardh-Al-Hassan and fundraising like the Sukuks and finally the importance of using a set of technologies, called Fintech, to build an alternative and sustainable financial system after Covid-19. Indeed, this health crisis should present different challenges to Islamic finance, which requires FinTech, in its new strategies and its financial services. Our Paper is structured as following, we start with a review of the literature, in a second part we present the covid-19 crisis and Islamic finance, the roles of Islamic products in the face of covid-19, and in a last part, the role of artificial intelligence in islamic finance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alternative funding; Covid-19; Fintech; Islamic banks; Islamic finance","","","","","","","","Fernandes N., Economic Effects of Coronavirus Outbreak (COVID-19) on the World Economy, (2020); Raza Rabbani M., Mohd A., Ali M., Rahiman H.U., Atif M., Zulfikar Z., Naseem Y., The response of Islamic financial service to the COVID-19 pandemic: The open social innovation of the financial system, J.

A non-probability sampling technique was employed to target the study participants. A total of 436 students from a private university in Jakarta, Indonesia, completed a self-administered online questionnaire. The collected quantitative data were screened and analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The quantitative analysis result revealed that students' willingness to utilize Fintech continuously is associated with their perceived benefits from such Fintech use. Particularly, students perceived that the benefits of seamless transactions offered by the technology had been the most critical factors that promoted their strong willingness. The data provides new insight related to the university students' use of Fintech for their economic and financial activities. The dataset is also significant for financial technology companies to target and attract more users, particularly from those university students. More importantly, the dataset will be useful for university program development to prepare their students with financial literacy. © 2022 The Author(s)","Fintech; Indonesia; Technology; University students; Willingness","","","","","","research and development institute of Universitas Muhammadiyah","This study was funded by a research grant from the research and development institute of Universitas Muhammadiyah Prof. DR.

Utilizing advanced econometric techniques, such as Fully Modified Least Squares (FMOLS) and Vector Autoregressive Error Correction Model (VECM), the investigation scrutinizes the hypothesized relationships among these variables. Panel unit root tests were deployed to assess stationarity, while panel least squares methodology was employed to determine the presence of co-integration among the variables under study. The analysis reveals that internet usage, GDP, and renewable energy consumption exhibit a notable influence in diminishing CO2 emissions within EAGLE economies. Additionally, the findings substantiate the existence of long-term causality originating from these variables and impacting CO2 emissions. Conversely, the role of ATM networks in CO2 emissions remains ambiguous, implying that financial technology’s influence on environmental sustainability is inconclusive. Consequently, the research posits that environmental sustainability in EAGLE economies is chiefly determined by factors such as internet usage, economic expansion, and renewable energy consumption, with financial technology demonstrating no discernable impact. In light of these findings, the study advocates for the reevaluation and adaptation of existing policies and strategies to account for shifting climatic conditions. By doing so, decision-makers can better align their efforts with the pursuit of environmental sustainability in the context of rapidly evolving economies. © 2023 by the authors.","EAGLE economies; economic growth; energy consumption; environmental sustainability; financial technology","alternative energy; econometrics; economic growth; energy use; environmental technology; information and communication technology; sustainability","","","","","","","Environmental Risk Factors and Health: Overcoming Challenges, Implementing Solutions, (2018); Environmental Topics.

These technologies are being utilized and applied in the financial services sector and their intervention in mobile payments which includes money transfers, loans, fundraising, asset, and property management. Several papers have been published to report the latest accomplishments and noted challenges faced in the financial technology field from different perspectives to address this need. Hence, a bibliometric study would be required to conduct a detailed examination of the current body of knowledge in financial technology research. To investigate the influence of financial technology on the financial industry, this paper searched a list of 764 research papers that were published between the period of 2015 and 2022. The Web Science (WoS), literature reviews, conducted systematic scientific, providing research for future research of the analysis results of co-citation and co-cited sources, disciplines, and keywords indicated a noted increase in the field publishing industry which has developed rapidly in recent years in numerous countries and interdisciplinary research. Additionally, institutions in the United States, China, and British are adept at hosting such multidisciplinary work.

This study used a survey design by taking a sample from one population and using a questionnaire as a basic data collection tool. In addition, this study was included as a confirmatory study because it tested previously tested models based on existing theories to explain causal relationships and carefully tested hypotheses on a social phenomenon in order to solve problems. Based on the results, the better the data security and privacy of borrowers by the P2P lending platform, the better the perceived usefulness will be. In addition, the better service quality provided by the P2P lending platform will greatly help expedite the process. There was no significant effect of perceived usefulness and behavioral intention on the intention to use the P2Plending platform. The results found that the quality of administrative services had no influence on the intention to use the P2P lending platform, while PEOU had a significant influence on PU because easy-to-use technology could be more useful. © 2023 The Authors","Data security and privacy; P2P lending platform; Perceived usefulness; Technology acceptance model","","","","","","","","Angelina, Kurniadi E., Hendityasari G.G., Mariani D.M., Analysis factors affecting lenders intention in P2p lending platform using utaut2 model, Turk.

The index uses a sample of 16 387 patents in the FinTech field registered over 20 years to assess the average quality of patents. To illustrate the utility of the index, the 1) top geographic jurisdictions, 2) top technical domains, and 3) leading organizations were analyzed to map out patterns of intellectual property registration and protection. This article provides significant insights on leading patent jurisdictions, illustrating the growing impact on FinTech of jurisdictions, such as the Republic of Korea, and the focus of patents within the USA in particular domains, such as payment protocols, e-commerce, and identification mechanisms. This article contributes to both theory and practice through the development and validation of a novel patent quality index, which has significant utility to multiple stakeholders and advances knowledge on assessing patent quality. Furthermore, by surfacing a positive association between the quality of an organization&#x0027;s FinTech patents and earnings, the article illustrates the value to organizations in developing high-quality patents in this field.

Peer-to-peer lending is a fintech product that provides loans to debtors at high interest rates. The maximum loan interest rate set by the Indonesian Joint Funding Fintech Association (AFPI) is 0.8% per day. This determination is very burdensome for the debtor as a consumer of financial services, so there needs to be protection and regulation by the authorized institution. This normative legal research aims to determine the role of the Financial Services Authority in determining the Financial Technology Loan Interest Rate as the Protection of Financial Services Consumers. The results of this study, that the role of the Financial Services Authority as an institution that has the authority to regulate and supervise bank and non-bank financial institutions, has issued Financial Services Authority Regulation no. 77/POJK.01/2016 concerning Information Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services. In the POJK, OJK does not set loan interest rates. Peer-to-peer fintech lending providers are encouraged to offer reasonable interest rates and are still within a reasonable range. © 2023 Thesar Yudi Prasetya, Didik Endro Purwoleksono and Astutik.","Consumer; Fintech; Loan Interest; OJK","","","","","","","","Sutedi Adrian, Aspek Hukum Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, (2014); Miru Ahmadi, Konsumen Hukum Perlindungan, Edisi Revisi, (2019); Mahendra Anju, Bunga Bank: Hukum, Faktor Yang Mempengaruhi, Dan Jenisnya, (2021); Tjandra Antoni, Kekosongan Norma Penentuan Bunga Pinjaman Financial Technology Peer To Peer Lending, Jurnal Hukum Bisnis Bonum Commune, 3, (2020); Prasetyawati Endang, Perlindungan Hukum Terhadap Para Pihak Dalam Pembiayaan Konsumen, Jurnal Ilmu Hukum, 8, (2012); Santi Ernama, Pengawasan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan Terhadap Financial Technology (Peraturan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan Nomor 77/POJK.01/2016), Diponegoro Law Journal, 6, (2017); Wayan Bagus Pramana I, Peranan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan Dalam Mengawasi Lembaga Keuangan Non Bank Berbasis Financial Technology Jenis Peer To Peer Lending, (2018); Jonathan, Mekanisme Penetapan Suku Bunga Pinjaman, Bisnis&UKM; Kasmir, Bank Dan Lembaga Keuangan Lainnya, (2014); Isnaeni Moch., Seberkas Diorama Hukum Kontrak, (2017); Darmanto Priyo, Prima Kamus, Indonesia Bahasaa, Disertai Bahasa Inggris, (2007); Astutik Sri, Restructuring Of Consumer Financing Agreements During The Covid-19 Pandemic, Awang Long Law Review, 2, (2020); Subagyono BSA, Chumaida ZV, Romadhona MK, Enforcement of Consumer Rights Through Dispute Settlement Resolution Agency to Improve the Consumer Satisfaction Index In Indonesia, (2022); Trisadini P., Usanti dan Abd.

This digital-based approach is one of the outputs of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which transformed the path of human history and resulted in the development of digital transformation strategy innovation, more commonly referred to as digitalisation. Previous literature has predicted that integrating fintech into waqf management will facilitate fintech's growth and expand waqf outreach in Malaysia. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the impact of “Industry 4.0” on the expansion of fintech into cash waqf in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovation (DOI) model. In addition, a quantitative approach based on structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the relationship between awareness, knowledge, relative advantage, social norms, perceived trust and fintech adoption in waqf institutions by using the tool Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) version 23.0 with maximum likelihood estimation. Findings: The overall indicate that perceived trust and social norms significantly influence the adoption of fintech by Malaysian waqf. At the same time, other factors such as awareness, relative advantage and knowledge do not appear to significantly influence the adoption of fintech amongst Malaysian waqf institutions. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes significantly to the current literature concerning the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the wave of technologies. In addition, this study supports relevant theories, including DOI and other technology adoption theories. Aside from this, the study provides empirical contributions to waqf management regarding collecting and distributing waqf, improving the level of regulation of the waqf institutions and enhancing trust between donors, waqf management and beneficiaries. This study is amongst the first in the area of waqf that focus on Malaysian waqf intitutions. Originality/value: This is important for policy development to support the utilisation of fintech for waqf institutions, which leads to more transparency and efficiency.

We document a persistent rise in bankruptcies in the affected states following sharp decreases in marketplace lending, particularly among low-income households and in areas where marketplace loans for financing medical bills are severely rationed. Borrowers’ indebtedness or local economic conditions do not explain the results. The supply of other consumer credit by banks and finance companies remains unaffected, suggesting that the observed increase in bankruptcies arises principally from reversing access to marketplace credit. © 2023","Alternative finance; Bankruptcy; Credit supply; Financial technology; Marketplace lending","","","","","","ABFER-CEPR-CUHK; Centre for the Economic Analysis of Risk; Swiss Society for Financial Market Research; Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, SUFE","We are grateful for comments from Fabio Braggion, Martin Brown, Dong Beom Choi, Claudia Custodio, Itay Goldstein, Lauren Lambie-Hanson, Dirk Jenter, Andrew Karolyi, Danny McGowan, Steven Ongena, Kim Peijnenburg, Klaus Schaeck, Stephan Siegel, Jessie Wang, Michelle White and Yao Zeng.

This represents a challenge for Islamic finance considered as an alternative finance especially after the advent of the 2009 global financial crisis. Islamic finance certainly has an important market share in crowdfunding and also in microfinance, and its role in the financing of SMEs all over the world is not negligible, and this financial crisis should therefore pose different challenges to Islamic finance. It requires a set of instruments specific to its category, and also needs new technologies (FinTech), strategies and financial services to cope with the possible phenomenon. Our work seeks to present how Islamic finance, with its specific financing instruments, can fight against the disastrous effects of this health crisis, in particular the instruments of Zakat, funding by Qardh-Al-Hassan and fundraising like the Sukuks and finally the importance of using a set of technologies, called Fintech, to build an alternative and sustainable financial system after Covid-19. Indeed, this health crisis should present different challenges to Islamic finance, which requires FinTech, in its new strategies and its financial services. Our Paper is structured as following, we start with a review of the literature, in a second part we present the covid-19 crisis and Islamic finance, the roles of Islamic products in the face of covid-19, and in a last part, the role of artificial intelligence in islamic finance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Alternative funding; Covid-19; Fintech; Islamic banks; Islamic finance","","","","","","","","Afkar T., Influence analysis of mudharabah financing and qardh financing to the profitability of islamic banking in Indonesia, Asian J.

Financial technology can provide not only an opportunity to tap into new pools of private capital to finance green and sustainable projects through innovative financial instruments but also provide support to clean technologies through the adoption of voluntary sustainability codes of conduct. However, there is still a lack of clear scientific evidence in the literature about how the green economy interacts with these relevant indicators of sustainable finance. Thus, this paper examines the time-varying causal relationship between indexes of financial technology (FinTech), clean technology (CleanTech), and the green economy (GECON), by applying the novel method proposed by Shi et al. (2018, 2020) on daily data from June 15, 2012 to December 15, 2021. This study finds a higher volatility and causality running from GECON to CleanTech and FinTech for the entire period. Furthermore, the green economy Granger causes FinTech and CleanTech with very significant episodes, especially at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The robustness of the results was checked with a rolling window and recursive evolving techniques that overall confirm bidirectional causal relationships between green economy and technology variables. The findings imply that global initiatives to achieve low-carbon economies need to be complemented with the use of clean technologies in the production process and the continuous digitalization of financial sectors. The promotion of clean technology production by governments and the increased interest of investors in FinTech industries will stimulate green economic growth. © 2022","Green economy; Sustainable finance; Technology; Time-varying causality","","","","","","","","Ahmad W., On the dynamic dependence and investment performance of crude oil and clean energy stocks, Res.

We exploit a data set combining Gallup World Polls and Global Findex surveys for some 250,000 individuals in 140 countries, merging them with information on the incidence of epidemics and local 3G Internet infrastructure. Epidemic exposure is associated with an increase in remote-access (online/mobile) banking and substitution from bank branch based to ATM activity. The temporary nature of the effects we identify is more consistent with a demand channel rather than that of supply with high initial fixed costs. Exploring heterogeneity using a machine learning–driven approach, we find that young, high-income earners in full-time employment have the greatest tendency to shift to online/mobile transactions in response to epidemics. Baseline effects are larger for individuals with better ex ante 3G signal coverage, highlighting the role of the digital divide in adaption to new technologies necessitated by adverse external shocks. © 2022 The Authors.

Fin-tech is fast growing right now. Finch's rise in the middle east aims to make it easier for the general people to perform financial transactions online, improve financial literacy, and achieve financial inclusion. This mapping study aims to identify prior fin-tech research and make recommendations for future research. This study employs a systematic literature review (SLR), which collects and evaluates available research on the topic of interest to produce an objective result that can be audited and replicated. The study offers a holistic and coherent review of finch applications and their related aspects built on a critical assessment of the literature. Fin-tech and its related aspects are expected to strike the right balance between retaining financial stability and offering consumer protection. They also have the potential to provide effective incentives for Fin-tech innovation. This study provides important insights and great evidence regarding the applications of finch in multiple disciplines. This leads practitioners, entrepreneurs and policymakers to improve performance as well as achieve competitiveness. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Financial technology; Literature review","","","","","","","","Agarwal S., Chua Y.H., FinTech and household finance: a review of the empirical literature, China Finance Rev.

This study's purpose was to analyze the impact of financial and technological literacy on improving MSME performance in Medan City and the mediation of this relationship by financial inclusion. The research had a quantitative descriptive methodology with an explanatory research approach. Data were collected from a sample of 100 business actors in Medan City. The data analysis technique used was Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS). The results showed that financial literacy, financial technology, and financial inclusion affected the performance of MSMEs in Medan City, and financial inclusion did not mediate the effects of financial literacy and financial technology on the performance of MSMEs in Medan City. The novelty of this research is its capacity to inform stakeholders of the importance of the financial literacy of MSME business actors; therefore, stakeholders must strive to educate MSME business actors on the importance of financial literacy. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Online Academic Press, USA.","Financial inclusion; Financial literacy; Financial technology","","","","","","","","Abidin M.

Therefore, the number of users increases rapidly, so user data become crucial and need to be maintained. This research collected data with an online questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique with 388 respondents. This research will analyze user trust using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) using AMOS 26. Examination of validity, reliability, normality, and goodness of fit was also tested to ensure the model, indicators, and dataset used were appropriate. This research shows that legal, financial, and privacy risk significantly influence perceived risk. Therefore, perceived risk and perceived security both have a substantial impact on trust. Trust also significantly affects attitude towards use, while attitude towards use significantly affects actual usage. © 2023 ICIC International.","FinTech service; Risk; SEM; Trust","","","","","","","","Mavlutova I., Volkova T., Natrins A., Spilbergs A., Arefjevs I., Miahkykh I., Financial sector transformation in the era of digitalization, Estud.

To solve the above problems, an ultra-short-term wind power prediction model based on the XGBoost algorithm combined with financial technical index feature engineering and variational ant colony algorithm is proposed. The model innovatively applies financial technical indicators from financial time series data to wind power time series data and creates a class of model input features that can highly condense the potential relationships between time series data. A bionic algorithm is used to search for the best computational parameters for financial technical indicators to reduce the reliance on financial experts' experience. Taking the German power company Tennet wind power data set as an example, the prediction model proposed in this study has an mean absolute error of 0.859 and a root mean square error of 1.329, and it takes only 244 ms to complete the prediction. Thus, this study provides a new solution for ultra-short-term wind power prediction. © 2023 The Authors","Gradient boosting regression trees; Industrial applications of financial technical indicators; Parameter optimization theory; Wind power prediction","","","","","","Key Technologies R&D Program of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, (2020GG0094); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (61962045); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia, (2019MS03014, 2021LHMS06001)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Project No. 61962045 ], the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region [Project No. 2021LHMS06001 and Project No. 2019MS03014 ], Key Technologies R&D Program of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region [Project No. 2020GG0094 ].","Gopi A., Sharma P., Sudhakar K., Ngui W.K., Kirpichnikova I., Cuce E., Weather impact on solar farm performance: a comparative analysis of machine learning techniques, Sustainability, 15, 1, (2023); Global Wind Report 2023, (2023); Croonenbroeck C., Dahl C.M., Accurate medium-term wind power forecasting in a censored classification framework, Energy, 73, pp. 221-232, (2014); Zhang W., Lin Z., Liu X., Short-term offshore wind power forecasting-A hybrid model based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), and deep-learning-based long short-term memory (LSTM), Renew.

Financial technology, formed by combining digital technology with traditional financial services, is gradually changing the financial service model and providing new ideas for corporate investment and financing. In this study, using the data of non-financial and non-real estate listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, A-shares from 2015 to 2020, we examine the effect of financial technology on corporate innovation through a fixed-effects model and investigate the influence of corporate characteristics on the relationship between financial technology and innovation through a moderating-effects model. The results show that financial technology enhances the ability to serve real enterprises by reshaping financial services, which in turn effectively drives an increase in corporate innovation, and the mechanism is conditionally heterogeneous. In addition, the moderating effect of the firm’s nature is found to be more significant in non-state-owned firms, high-technology firms, and firms in the growth and maturity stages by life cycle. The policy implications of this study are to continuously promote theoretical research, to guide the development of fintech, and to improve the construction of financial technology infrastructure. Additionally, to deepen the integration of financial technology with real enterprises and establish differentiated financial technology support tools, so as to improve the pre-cision of promoting enterprise innovation. © 2022 by the authors.

This research is based on the analysis of financial institutions from 37 countries. Authors use regulatory sandboxes that are introduced in countries as an external FinTech shock to examine the impact of financial technology on financial institution stability. Some observations can be drawn: 1) if market characteristics are not considered, then there is no effect on the financial institution vulnerability linked to the shock of FinTech innovation; 2) development of FinTech in developed countries can reduce (or increase) the vulnerability (instability) of financial markets; 3) FinTech impacts the vulnerability (instability) of financial institutions through the profitability. Nevertheless, these indicators do not consider the complex multidimensional essence of FinTech. This article summarises how FinTech and developed financial institutions and the financial sector are in terms of their depth, access, and efficiency. The article offers a valuable analytical means of developing FinTech impact on financial stability for researchers and policymakers. © 2022 The Author(s).

Therefore, the present study proposes a research model that integrates the main constructs involved in Fintech continuance intention. Design/methodology/approach: The current study uses a meta-analytic-based correlation analysis of effect sizes, meta-regression analysis and meta-analytic structural equation modeling, with 247 effect sizes in 69 studies involving 26,140 respondents. Findings: The results reveal continuance intention is driven by satisfaction and trust, with ease of use and usefulness being antecedents of satisfaction and trust. The authors also found evidence to show satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between ease of use and continuance intention and that trust fully mediates the relationship between ease of use and continuance intention and partially mediates the relationship between usefulness and continuance intention. In addition, the authors found that in Western countries, with higher Human Development Index levels and greater of use of electronic payment, satisfaction has more impact on continuance intention. Practical implications: From a theoretical standpoint, this meta-analytic study has implications for the literature on Fintech by offering an empirical generalization on the strength of the antecedents of Fintech continuance intentions and by testing possible moderators in a wide range of countries and studies. In other words, this study’s goal is to broaden the scope of the research. Regarding managerial implications, it is important to listen to user opinions regarding the positive and negative points of their experience with these technologies and take them into consideration when planning improvements. Additionally, the analysis shows the importance of using data from user interaction with technology, obtained, for example, through big data analytics, whereby companies can see how users behave, how much time they spend accessing certain functions and which technological features they use most, and thus seek to improve whatever is needed. Originality/value: This meta-analytic study advances the understanding of Fintech continuance intentions. Using the proposed approach, it is possible to generate accurate estimates of the effect size of each analyzed antecedent as the meta-analytic method jointly evaluates the results produced by a wide variety of studies performed in different contexts, allowing more accurate conclusions to be drawn. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuance intention;

This study attempts to examine the strength of market risk post the financial crisis and financial technology disruption. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the advancement of market risk in the Indonesian banking industry following the crisis and disruption. Literature has shown that the role of market risk in other countries accentuates after the crisis. Using panel data from forty-nine banks listed in the Indonesia stock exchange during the 2009 – 2020 period, this study concentrates on the role of Market Risk Indicators (MRIs) in financial performance. The findings suggest that MRIs alter the profitability indicators. The effect of MRIs becomes more robust as moving further away from 2007.

Such hi-tech modifications are anticipated to sell the stableness of the financial system and lessen its predominant actors’ risk-taking behaviour. However, there needs to be more practical proof to guide the effect of financial inclusion based on financial technology on the risky behaviour of South Asia micro-finance institutes. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, the authors industrialised a fresh index to calculate financial inclusion based on financial technology and empirically measure its position in decreasing the risk-taking approach of micro-finance institutes. The use of numerous robustness examinations endorsed the rationality of the authors’ outcomes. Findings: Z-scoring or standard scoring outcomes of FinInc support the extant studies displaying its incredible connection with economic stability, which interprets as a terrible courting with risky behaviour of micro-finance institutes. Consequently, the authors highlighted the significance of the universality and openness of financial technology solutions in minimising risk of micro-finance institutes. Moreover, the authors concluded that financial technology is greater related to small-size micro-finance institutes. Originality/value: This study currently focusing South Asia, which has not been explored before, and it is the first time to research financial inclusion with Fintech in this area. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Financial inclusion; FinTech; Micro-finance institutes; Risky behaviour; South Asia","","","","","","","","Adedokun M.W., Aga M., Financial inclusion: a pathway to economic growth in Sub-Saharan African economies, International Journal of Finance and Economics, pp. 1-17, (2021); Ahmad A.H., Green C., Jiang F., Mobile money, financial inclusion and development: a review with reference to African experience, Journal of Economic Surveys, 34, 4, pp. 753-792, (2020); Ajide K.B., Alimi O.Y., Asongu S.A., Raheem I.D., The role of institutional infrastructures in financial inclusion-growth relations: evidence from SSA, International Journal of Finance and Economics, 27, 1, pp. 175-191, (2022); Ali M., Hashmi S.H., Nazir M.R., Bilal A., Nazir M.I., Does financial inclusion enhance economic growth?

It starts by exploring the first era of United States corporate finance that began with the ratifications of the Constitution in the 1790s and ended with the Great Depression in the 1930s. It then explains the trends that can be identified in the second relevant era in the United States, which started around the time the Securities Act of 1933 was enacted and ended with the Dot-Com bubble. Finally, it continues by exploring the third relevant era, which we are currently living in; the era commenced with the financial crisis of the early 2000s and was further intensified with the Great Recession of 2007–2008 and is characterised by the emergence of non-traditional finance, such as crypto-currency in general and Bitcoin in particular in 2008. It concludes by arguing that currently few people understand how new cutting-edge technologies impact investing, the true nature of finance today, and where it is trending. © 2023, Sweet and Maxwell-Thomson Reuters.

Particularly for the sizable portion of society that does not interact with the banking system, financial technology has the potential to transform the structure of financial services and make them faster, less expensive, and safer. The hypothesis model is based on technology acceptance model (TAM). The methodology in this study includes data collection through questionnaires distributed to the users of financial technology, and the sample included the users and nonusers of mobile financial services. Structural equation modeling is utilized for data analysis procedures when using survey data gathered from 300 customers who have access to financial technology services in Algerian Islamic banks. The objective of this study is to determine the factors (including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, trust, convenience, and social image) influencing user intention to use financial technology services in Algerian Islamic banks. The implications of this research help to determine the right strategy to know the customers’ perceptions and the factors influencing their choice of using mobile banking services.

The study mainly includes ease of use, perceived usefulness, facilitating conditions, social influences, adoption readiness and intention to use financial technology (FinTech) in India. This paper aims to discuss FinTech and its dynamic changes in the banking sector. This study tests the mediation influence of perceived trust on adoption readiness and intention to use FinTech in India. The proposed impact of mediation of perceived trust was significant but small on adoption readiness and intention to use FinTech. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey was administered to mobile payment users, and 349 responses were collected. Structural equations are analyzed to determine the proposed variables’ direct effects on adopting them. Additionally, to examine indirect effects, the mediation test is used. Findings: The analysis results support the proposed model and thus help explain the impact of adoption readiness, trust and intention to use digital payment. The study’s significant findings will enable mobile payment institutions to understand the variables related to the growing use of technology in customers’ contexts. The study reveals the significance of ease of use, perceived usefulness and facilitating the service condition, which means that vendors prefer to use compatible devices that are easy to use with other devices. The analysis also explores the critical influence of perceived usefulness on customer behavior, enabling software designers to encourage accessible processes and device advantages for customers. Practical implications: Mobile payment systems offered by financial institutions until currently become a variety of mobile payment services due to rapidly evolving information technology. This work is a groundbreaking attempt to apply technology acceptance in recent years to the emerging framework of mobile banking systems. This study examines the adoption of mobile payment technologies by proposing an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) to capture the issues associated with adoption in India through banking users. Now customers are aware that cyberattacks on banking networks and data breaches quickly through media and social networks. Also, they know that the industry has done little to avoid or mitigate these attacks. Originality/value: This study examines the adoption of mobile payment technologies by proposing an extended TAM to capture the issues associated with adoption in India through banking users. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customers; Intention to use; Mobile payments; Perceived trust; Technology usage","Economic and social effects; Finance; Global system for mobile communications; Sales; Customer; Ease-of-use; Extended technology acceptance models; Intention to use; Mobile payment; Mobile payment system; Payment services; Perceived trusts; Perceived usefulness; Technology usages; Electronic money","","","","","","","Abhishek, Hemchand S., Adoption of sensor-based communication for mobile marketing in India, Journal of Indian Business Research, 8, 1, pp. 65-76, (2016); Agarwal R., Rastogi S., Mehrotra A., Customers’ perspectives regarding banking in an emerging economy, Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, 16, 5, pp. 340-351, (2009); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behaviour and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Al Nawayseh M.K., Fintech in COVID-19 and beyond: what factors are affecting customers’ choice of fintech applications?, Journal Open Innov: Technol Mark Complex, 6, 4, pp. 1-15, (2020); Alalwan A.A., Dwivedi Y.K., Rana N., Factors influencing adoption of mobile and programming, (2017); Alkhowaiter W.A., Digital payment and banking adoption research in Gulf countries: a systematic literature review, International Journal of Information Management, 53, (2020); Al-Maghrabi T., Dennis C., What drives consumers' continuance intention to e‐shopping?, International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management, 39, 12, pp. 899-926, (2011); Ameen N., Shah M.H., Sims J., Choudrie J., Willis R., Are there peas in a pod when considering mobile phone and mobile applications use: a quantitative study, J Retail Consum Serv, 55, (2020); Anyaso F.I., Otubo P.A., Mobile phone technology in banking system: its economic effect, Research Journal of Information Technology, 1, 1, pp. 1-5, (2009); Barbuta I., Dobrean S., Gaza M., Mihaila M., Screpnic A., Mobile payments guide 2012: insights in the worldwide mobile financial service market, (2012); Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 6, pp. 1173-1182, (1986); Bartlett M.S., A note on multiplying factors for various chi-squared approximations, J.

The mediating role of locus of control in the relationship between financial knowledge and management behavior is still being investigated. This study employs a purposive sampling strategy to collect data from a population of female MSME owners in East Java, utilizing a causal explanatory research design. In this research, SmartPLS 3.0 was utilized for data analysis. The study found that while financial knowledge and financial technology did not influence financial management behavior, financial attitude, financial self-efficacy, financial literacy, and emotional intelligence did. However, other findings show that the link between financial literacy and prudent decision-making is not mediated by locus of control. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.

However, the impact of financial technology on the shadow banking activities of non-financial firms has not been examined. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms from 2011 to 2018, we find that regional financial technology is positively associated with the shadow banking activities of non-financial firms, which is more pronounced for firms with low profitability and firms listed only in China's A-share market. We show that financial technology can enhance the shadow banking activities by alleviating financing constraints. In addition, an increase in the equalization of profit rate and an increase in investment in the real economy reduce the positive effect of financial technology on the shadow banking activities. Further analysis suggests that financial regulations can attenuate excessive shadow banking activities of non-financial firms driven by financial technology. © 2023","Financial regulation; Financial technology; Shadow banking","","","","","","National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (21ASH003)","This paper is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China, China, Grant Number: 21ASH003.","Allen F., Qian Y., Tu G., Yu F., Entrusted loans: A close look at China's shadow banking system, Journal of Financial Economics, 133, 1, pp. 18-41, (2019); An P., Yu M., Neglected part of shadow banking in China, International Review of Economics Finance, 57, pp. 211-236, (2018); Buchak G., Matvos G., Piskorski T., Seru A., Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks, Journal of Financial Economics, 130, 3, pp. 453-483, (2018); Cao S., Nie L., Sun H., Sun W., Taghizadeh-Hesary F., Digital finance, green technological innovation and energy-environmental performance: Evidence from China's regional economies, Journal of Cleaner Production, 327, (2021); Chen K., Ren J., Zha T., The nexus of monetary policy and shadow banking in China, American Economic Review, 108, 12, pp. 3891-3936, (2018); Chen Z., He Z., Liu C., The financing of local government in China: Stimulus loan wanes and shadow banking waxes, Journal of Financial Economics, 137, 1, pp. 42-71, (2020); Cheng M., Qu Y., Does bank FinTech reduce credit risk? evidence from China, Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, 63, (2020); Cho T., Chen Y., The impact of financial technology on China's banking industry: An application of the metafrontier cost Malmquist productivity index, North American Journal of Economics Finance, 57, (2021); Dong J., Yin L., Liu X., Hu M., Li X., Liu L., Impact of internet finance on the performance of commercial banks in China, International Review of Financial Analysis, 72, (2020); Du J., Li C., Wang Y., A comparative study of shadow banking activities of non-financial firms in transition economies, China Economic Review, 46, pp. 35-49, (2017); Elliott D., Kroeber A., Qiao Y., Shadow banking in China: a primer, the Brookings institution, Brookings Economic Studies, (2015); Feve P., Moura A., Pierrard O., Shadow banking and financial regulation: A small-scale DSGE perspective, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 101, pp. 130-144, (2019); Goh K.H., Kauffman R.J., Firm strategy and the Internet in US commercial banking, Journal of Management Information Systems, 30, 2, pp. 9-40, (2013); Gomber P., Kauffman R.J., Parker C., Weber B.W., Special Issue: Financial Information Systems and the Fintech Revolution, Journal of Management Information Systems, 35, 1, pp. 12-18, (2018); Grennan J., Michaely R., FinTechs and the market for financial analysis, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 56, 6, pp. 1877-1907, (2021); Gu S., Kelly B., Xiu D., Empirical asset pricing via machine learning, Review of Financial Studies, 33, pp. 2223-2273, (2020); Guo F., Wang J., Wang F., Cheng Z., Kong T., Zhang X., Measuring China's digital financial inclusion: index compilation and spatial characteristics, China Economic Quarterly, 19, 4, pp. 1401-1418, (2020); Han X., Li J.J., Financial mismatch, the shadow banking activities of non-financial enterprises and funds being diverted out of the real economy, Journal of Financial Economics, 8, pp. 93-111, (2020); Han X., Li J.J., Policy continuity, non-financial enterprises’ shadow banking activities, and social responsibility activities, Journal of Financial Research, 495, 9, pp. 131-150, (2021); Haselmann R., Wachtel P., Sabott J., Credit institutions, ownership and bank lending in transition countries, The Palgrave handbook of European banking, (2016); Jiang W., Have instrumental variables brought us closer to the truth, Review of Corporate Finance Studies, 6, pp. 127-140, (2017); Jiang G., Lee C., Yue H., Tunneling through intercorporate loans: the China experience, Journal of Financial Economics, 98, 1, pp. 1-20, (2010); Kaplan S.N., Zingales L., Do investment-cash flow sensitivities provide useful measures of financing constraints?, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 112, 1, pp. 169-215, (1997); Lamont O., Polk C., Saa-Requejo J., Financial constraints and stock returns, Review of Financial Studies, 14, 2, pp. 529-554, (2001); Lee C.C., Li X., Yu C.H., Zhao J., Does fintech innovation improve bank efficiency?

Using micro data from the Survey on Household Income and Wealth conducted by the Bank of Italy for the period 1991–2016, we find that wealthy households achieve higher returns than other households. With an instrumental variable approach to control for endogeneity, we find that financial development (number of bank branches) and financial technology (use of remote banking) both have a positive association with households’ financial wealth and financial returns. While households of all wealth deciles benefit from the effects of financial development and financial technology, these benefits are larger when moving toward the top of the wealth distribution. However, the economic significance of this gap fell in the last part of the sample period, as remote banking became more widespread. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Banks; Financial development; Financial technology; Fintech; Inequality","","","","","","","","Acemoglu D., Technical change, inequality and the labor market, J.

The study finds that China is the leading publisher of the fintech articles followed by U.S.A and U.K followed by India at fourth place. Also, it is seen that fintech overlaps between engineering and management disciplines where one leads in innovation and other in disbursement of technology. Hence, fintech leading journals are in management discipline. Fintech is studied in close association with financial inclusion, blockchain, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence in majority along with some other minor applications. It is also evident that the next fintech revolution would be led by countries like India and China as the growth of articles and studies in these countries is increasing at a faster pace.  © 2023 IEEE.","Bibliometric analysis; Fintech; India; Visual study; Vos viewer","'current; Bibliometrics analysis; Block-chain; Financial inclusions; India; Technology application; Technology revolution; Visual analysis; Visual study; Vos viewer; Finance","","","","","","","Philippon T., On Fintech and Financial Inclusion, National Bureau of Economic Research, (2019); Cai C.W., Disruption of financial intermediation by FinTech: A review on crowdfunding and blockchain, Accounting & Finance, 58, 4, pp. 965-992, (2018); Ashta A., Herrmann H., Artificial intelligence and fintech: An overview of opportunities and risks for banking, investments, and microfinance, Strategic Change, 30, pp. 211-222, (2021); Utami A.F., Ekaputra I.A., Japutra A., Adoption of FinTech Products: A Systematic Literature Review, Journal of Creative Communications, 16, 3, pp. 233-248, (2021); Singh S., Sahni M.M., Kovid R.K., What drives FinTech adoption?

Banks have begun to use big data to enhance customer experience, optimize operations, and create novel products and services. This study investigates the effect of big data governance on financial technology in Jordanian commercial banks. The study focuses on the four dimensions of big data governance: strategy and planning, ethics and social responsibility, data quality and management, and infrastructure and architecture. Additionally, the study considers the mediating role of organizational culture in the relationship between big data governance and financial technology. Primary data were collected from 250 IT employees working in Jordanian commercial banks, and the data were analyzed using PLS-SEM. The study findings indicate that big data governance has a significant positive effect on financial technology in Jordanian commercial banks. Additionally, it has been discovered that organizational culture partially mediates the relationship between big data governance and financial technology, emphasizing the significance of creating a culture that encourages the efficient use of data in fintech. In the context of Jordanian commercial banks, this study presents empirical evidence for the connection between big data governance and financial technology. The results indicate that big data governance measures should be applied while taking organizational culture into account as a potential mediator of the effects on financial technology. This study offers guidance on how to successfully integrate big data governance policies in commercial banks to advance financial technology for bank managers and policymakers. © 2023.","Big Data Governance; Financial Technology; Jordanian Commercial Banks; PLS-SEM","","","","","","","","Abu Karaki M., Alaraj A., Alomari N., Adoption of Online Banking Services in Jordan: An Examination of the Theory of Planned Behavior, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 23, 4, pp. 183-191, (2018); Ahmad N.

The present investigation aims to thoroughly explore the impact of fintech upon Islamic banks and also investigate how fintech facilities affect Islamic banks performance within Jordan. A strategy known as a quantita-tive-descriptive inquiry was used in the inquiry. This study made use of yearly data (a panel data) that was collected from banking organizations using statistics based on yearly reports provided by Jordan Islamic bank, Safwa Islamic Bank and International Arab Islamic Bank listed alongside the Amman Stock Exchange between 2017 and 2021. The study discovered that financial performance of Islamic Banks was significantly impacted by Fintech services including online banking along with mobile banking. The increased beta value predicts that between 2017 to 2021, the financial prosperity of Arab Islamic International Bank, Jordan Islamic Bank, and Safwa Islamic Bank would be positively correlated with Fintech services. Additionally, it was discovered that SMS Financing and crowdsourcing had a detrimental impact on Islamic Banks financial perfor-mance. The investigation concludes by recommending that Islamic banking included in the study step up their attempts to educate the public about Islamic banking facilities. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Fintech Services; Islamic Bank; Islamic Banking; Jordan's Islamic Bank (JIB); Panel Data","","","","","","","","Alam N., Gupta L., Zameni A., Fintech and Islamic Finance, (2019); Al-Eitan G.

As a bibliometric and visualization tool for the Web of Science core collection database and viewer-based literature, 918 papers dealing with Islamic finance and financial technology authored between 1999 and 2022 were analyzed. Cluster analysis, all-keyword co-occurrence analysis, and bibliographic coupling mapping are all investigated in the study. This research enables us to propose future research paths that may be useful in reflecting on the significant impact that technology will have on the growth of Islamic finance and financial technology. The survey discovered four main research trends: the first trend shown is “Financial Inclusion and Corporate Governance in Islamic Fintech”. The second trend focuses on “information technology and future financial Islamic services”. The third trend is “The Transformation of Islamic Finance: How Fintech is Changing the Game”. The fourth trend is related to “Islamic Finance: A Growing Force in the Digital Age”. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of research trends at the intersection of Islamic finance and financial technology, identifying future research directions. © 2023 by the authors.","bibliometric analysis; financial technology; Islamic finance","","","","","","","","Abdeljawad I., Hashem S.Q., Rashid M., Fintech and Islamic Financial Institutions: Applications and Challenges, FinTech in Islamic Financial Institutions: Scope, Challenges, and Implications in Islamic Finance, pp. 193-222, (2022); Abedifar P., Ebrahim S.M., Molyneux P., Tarazi A., Islamic banking and finance: Recent empirical literature and directions for future research, A Collection of Reviews on Savings and Wealth Accumulation, pp. 59-91, (2016); Abojeib M., Habib F., Blockchain for Islamic social responsibility institutions, Research Anthology on Blockchain Technology in Business, Healthcare, Education, and Government, pp. 1114-1128, (2021); Ahmad S.M., Al Mamun A., Opportunities of Islamic FinTech: The Case of Bangladesh and Turkey, CenRaPS Journal of Social Sciences, 2, pp. 412-426, (2020); Ahmed S., Alshater M.M., Ammari A.E., Hammami H., Artificial intelligence and machine learning in finance: A bibliometric review, Research in International Business and Finance, 61, (2022); Alaeddin O., Dakash M.A., Azrak T., Implementing the blockchain technology in islamic financial industry: Opportunities and challenges, Journal of Information Technology Management, 13, pp. 99-115, (2021); Alam I., Seifzadeh P., Marketing Islamic financial services: A review, critique, and agenda for future research, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 13, (2020); Ali H., Abdullah R., Zaini M.Z., Fintech and its potential impact on Islamic banking and finance industry: A case study of Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia, International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance (IJIEF), 2, pp. 73-108, (2019); Al-Matari E.M., Mgammal M.H., Alosaimi M.H., Alruwaili T.F., Al-Bogami S., Fintech, board of directors and corporate performance in Saudi Arabia financial sector: Empirical study, Sustainability, 14, (2022); Alshater M.M., Khan A., Hassan M.K., Paltrinieri A., Islamic Banking: Past, Present and Future, Journal of College of Sharia and Islamic Studies, 41, (2023); Alshater M.M., Saba I., Supriani I., Rabbani M.R., Fintech in islamic finance literature: A review, Heliyon, 8, (2022); Alshater M., Hassan K., Khan A., Saba I., Influential and intellectual structure of Islamic finance: A bibliometric review, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 14, pp. 339-365, (2021); Alshater M., Saad R.A.J., Wahab N.A., Saba I., What do we know about zakat literature?

Quantile estimators of the proposed method are used as empirical “location” measures for the heterogeneous influence of fintech on GTFP. Two nonparallel twin functions at each quantile level capture the unbalanced information between fintech and GTFP. The empirical results show that fintech effectively promotes the quality of economic growth in every province, while the effects of fintech on GTFP are heterogeneous and unbalanced. Specifically, the effects in high-green-development regions are more powerful than those in low-green-development regions. Moreover, the influencing strength of fintech on GTFP among provincial regions has become weaker in recent years. The impact mechanism test indicates that fintech mainly promotes GTFP through the upgrading of industrial structure. Based on these results, this paper discusses some policy recommendations, such as optimizing the allocation of financial technology resources, improving the quality of innovation, promoting the upgrading of industrial structure, and strengthening foreign exchange and cooperation for the sustainable development. © 2023 The Authors","Financial technology; Green total factor productivity; Heterogeneous effect; Quantile regression approach","","","","","","Philosophy and Social Sciences Leading Talent Training Project of Zhejiang Province, (21YJRC07-1YB); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (12101552, 61603338); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, ZJNSF, (LY21F030013)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 12101552 and 61603338 ), the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (No. LY21F030013 ), the Philosophy and Social Sciences Leading Talent Training Project of Zhejiang Province (No. 21YJRC07-1YB ).","Bu Y., Li H., Wu X., Effective regulations of FinTech innovations: The case of China, Economics of Innovation and New Technology, pp. 1-19, (2021); Cao Q., Contradiction between input and output of Chinese scientific research: A multidimensional analysis, Scientometrics, 123, 1, pp. 451-485, (2020); Cortes C., Vapnik V., Support-vector networks, Machine Learning, 20, 3, pp. 273-297, (1995); Chen J., Abbas J., Najam H., Liu J., Abbas J., Green technological innovation, green finance, and financial development and their role in green total factor productivity: Empirical insights from China, Journal of Cleaner Production, 382, (2023); Chen L., From fintech to finlife: The case of fintech development in China, China Economic Journal, 9, 3, pp. 225-239, (2016); Chen S., Golley J., Green productivity growth in China's industrial economy, Energy Economics, 44, pp. 89-98, (2014); Cheng M., Qu Y., Does bank FinTech reduce credit risk?

Financial technology involves software, applications, and other technologies designed to improve and automate traditional forms of financial services for businesses established in different areas. The authors aimed to explore the impact of financial technology on the digital literacy rate in India, by utilizing the poverty score as a moderating variable. The panel data analysis (PDA) has been employed in the current study. Data from 29 states and two union territories (UTs) of India were considered for three financial years, i.e., 2017–2018 to 2019–2020. The study’s findings reveal that Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs), both in terms of numbers and amount, are positively associated with the literacy rate. However, ATMs are negatively significant in association with literacy rate. Furthermore, the study’s empirical results show that KCCs and ATMs positively impact literacy when interacting with poverty scores. The study’s findings bring noteworthy implications for the government and other officials to understand the situation at the ground level of Indian states and UTs while forming new rules and policies for society’s betterment, particularly in finance and digital literacy. Additionally, the findings imply that ordinary people living in urban and rural areas of India should take advantage of financial technology and get motivated towards digital literacy. © 2022 by the authors.","ATMs; digital literacy; financial technology; Kisan credit cards","","","","","","","","Anagnostopoulos I., Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Anand S.K., Chhikara K.S., A theoretical and quantitative analysis of financial inclusion and economic growth, Management and Labour Studies, 38, pp. 103-133, (2013); Arner D.W., Barberis J., Buckley R.P., The evolution of Fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm, Geo.

The development of financial technology has influenced the behaviour of commercial banks. It has promoted the innovation of commercial banks. And it has promoted the digital transformation of commercial banks. In this paper, it is intended to explore the relationship between financial technology and digital transformation of banks through positive analysis. As well as to explore how the age of enterprises listed and enterprise life cycle affect the relationship between financial technology and digital transformation of banks. This paper conducts an empirical research on the data of China's A-share listed banks from 2011 to 2021 using a two-way fixed effects regression method. The results of the research indicate that financial technology promotes banks' digital transformation. Meanwhile, the age of enterprise listing and enterprise life cycle play a positive moderating role in financial technology promoting banks' digital transformation.

The study also analyzed the moderating impact of financial technology on the financial development and shadow economy nexus. The study employed Breusch-Pegan LM (1980) and Pesaran (2004) tests for investigating cross-sectional dependency, followed by Pesaran's (2007) CADF panel unit root test. The study applied Westerlund's (2007) panel cointegration and CS-ARDL approach for examining cointegration and estimating long-run relationships. Moreover, Konya's (2006) panel causality is also applied to examine the possible causal relationship among the variables. The study explored that financial sector development and using financial technology are negatively related to the shadow economy. The study also found the significant moderating role of financial technology in the financial development and shadow economy nexus. Furthermore, the results highlighted a bidirectional causal relationship between economic growth and the shadow economy in South Africa, India, and Russia. A bidirectional causality between financial technology and the shadow economy is also identified in India and Russia. Finally, based on empirical results, financial development, and technology-related policies are suggested for policymakers to curtail the shadow economy. © 2023 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois","Bootstrap panel causality; CS-ARDL; Financial development; Financial technology; Shadow economy","","","","","","","","Abbasi K., Alam A., Du M.A., Huynh T.L.D., FinTech, SME efficiency and national culture: Evidence from OECD countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 163, (2021); Abu-Lila Z., Ajlouni S., Ghazo A., Nonlinearity between financial development and the shadow economy: Evidence from Jordan, Accounting, 7, 5, pp. 1049-1054, (2021); Afzal M.H.B., Sustainable development of rural communities in Bangladesh by integrating mobile internet and agent banking technology, In Leadership Innovation and entrepreneurship as driving forces of the global economy, pp. 361-370, (2017); Agur I., Peria S.M., Rochon C., Digital financial services and the pandemic: Opportunities and risks for emerging and developing economies, International Monetary Fund Special Series COVID-19 Transmission, 1, pp. 1-13, (2020); Ali A., Ramakrishnan S., Faisal F., Sulimany H.G.H., Bazhair A.H., Stock market resource curse: The moderating role of institutional quality, Resources Policy, 78, (2022); Anagnostopoulos I., Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Bayar Y., Ozturk O.F., Financial development and shadow economy in european union transition economies, Managing Global Transitions International Research Journal, 14, (2016); Bose N., Capasso S., Wurm M.A., The impact of banking development on the size of shadow economies, Journal of Economic Studies, (2012); Becker G.S., Crime and punishment: an economic approach, The Economic Dimensions of Crime, pp. 13-68, (1968); Berdiev A.N., Saunoris J.W., Financial development and the shadow economy: A panel VAR analysis, Economic Modelling, 57, pp. 197-207, (2016); Bittencourt M., Gupta R., Stander L., Tax evasion, financial development and inflation: Theory and empirical evidence, Journal of Banking & Finance, 41, pp. 194-208, (2014); Blackburn K., Bose N., Capasso S., Tax evasion, the underground economy and financial development, Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, 83, 2, pp. 243-253, (2012); Borlea S.N., Achim M.V., Miron M.G., Corruption, shadow economy and economic growth: An empirical survey across the European Union countries, Studia Universitatis Vasile Goldiș Arad, Seria Științe Economice, 27, 2, pp. 19-32, (2017); Breusch T.S., Pagan A.R., The Lagrange multiplier test and its applications to model specification in econometrics, The Review of economic Studies, 47, 1, pp. 239-253, (1980); Capasso S., Jappelli T., Financial development and the underground economy, Journal of Development Economics, 101, pp. 167-178, (2013); Canh N.P., Thanh S.D., Financial development and the shadow economy: A multi-dimensional analysis, Economic Analysis and Policy, 67, pp. 37-54, (2020); Chai S., Chen Y., Huang B., Ye D., (2018); Chudik A., Mohaddes K., Pesaran M.H., Raissi M., Is there a debt-threshold effect on output growth?, Review of Economics and Statistics, 99, 1, pp. 135-150, (2017); Chudik A., Pesaran A.M., (2013); Cole R.A., Cumming D.J., Taylor J., (2019); Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Singer D., Ansar S., Hess J., The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring financial inclusion and the fintech revolution, (2018); Destek M.A., Aslan A., Renewable and non-renewable energy consumption and economic growth in emerging economies: Evidence from bootstrap panel causality, Renewable Energy, 111, pp. 757-763, (2017); Dahmani M., Mabrouki M., Youssef A.B., (2021); Dharmadasa P.D.C.S., Fintech Services” and the future of financial intermediation: A review, Sri Lanka Journal of Economic Research, 8, (2021); Elgin C., Kose M.A., Ohnsorge F., (2021); (2017); Evans O., Connecting the poor: The internet, mobile phones and financial inclusion in Africa, Digital Policy Regulation and Governance, 20, 6, pp. 568-581, (2018); Gharleghi B., Jahanshahi A.A., The shadow economy and sustainable development: The role of financial development, Journal of Public Affairs, 20, 3, (2020); Gozgor G., Demir E., Belas J., Yesilyurt S., Does economic uncertainty affect domestic credits?

The results of this empirical exercise showed that (1) OBI has a significant negative correlation with BRT, evidencing that off-balance-sheet business innovation can improve bank risk management processes and enhance the bank’s operating performance, thereby reducing their willingness to transfer risks, restraining the BRT level. Compared with state-owned and joint-stock banks, OBI has a more significant inhibitory effect on BRT in urban and rural commercial banks. (2) BAC showed a mediation role in the relationship between OBI and BRT levels. Bank OBI can inhibit BRT levels by BAC reduction, demonstrating an effective mediation channel. (3) The degree of BCMP displayed a positive moderation effect on the relationship between the explained and explanatory variables, which means that, at higher BCMP levels, the inhibitory effect of OBI on BRT levels becomes more significant. (4) Additionally, this exercise also found that a bank’s ICQ can enhance the impact of OBI on BRT. The research contributions of this paper constitute an important theoretical significance and reference value for researchers exploring mechanisms that can improve innovation in the commercial banking industry and give importance to financial supervision and financial system risk control. © 2023 by the authors.","agency cost; bank risk-taking; banking industry competition; internal control quality; off-balance-sheet business innovation","China; banking; business; financial system; innovation; panel data; risk assessment","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE, (20YJA790014)","This research was funded by the Humanities and Social Science Research Program of the Ministry of Education of China under the project “Mechanism and policy research on the influence of cross-border capital flow on the credit risk of commercial banks” (20YJA790014).","Zheng L., Deepening the supply-side structural reform of China’s financial system: A financial function perspective, Financ.

Using 32,196 US-listed firm-year observations from 2012 to 2021, we find that the Top 25 FinTech firms experience greater reporting audit and financial lags than other firms, suggesting that strict financial regulations, cybersecurity concerns, and reconciling mixed transactions affect financial reporting's timeliness. Moreover, higher-ranked Top 25 FinTech firms experience greater reporting lags than lower-ranked firms.

The study uses Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data collected from a sample of 500 SMEs in Jordan. The results of the study suggest that FinTech adoption positively affects financial performance, while financial satisfaction mediates the relationship between FinTech adoption and financial performance. The study also found that financial satisfaction has a significant impact on financial performance, suggesting that customers who are satisfied with their financial situation are more likely to achieve better financial performance. In conclusion, the study provides valuable insights into the role of financial satisfaction as a mediator in the relationship between FinTech adoption and financial performance, highlighting the importance of understanding the factors that influence customer satisfaction and the adoption of FinTech services in the financial industry.

By automatically processing images and text information, financial institutions can greatly reduce labor costs, improve overall operational efficiency, and help financial institutions identify and predict risks more accurately, thereby improving risk management capabilities. The existing image symbol recognition and scene text detection methods may be affected in terms of recognition accuracy when processing complex scenes, low-resolution images or texts affected by obstacles, distortions and other factors. To this end, this study conducts an in-depth study on the application of deep learning-based intelligent image recognition in financial technology services. It elaborates the application scenarios of image symbol recognition and scene text detection in financial technology services. The ASTER model is improved, and the combination of attention mechanism sequential decoding can effectively capture local information and global dependencies in the feature sequence, thereby improving the recognition accuracy of the image symbol recognition model. By focusing on the center point position information of the text, pixels with the same center point are aggregated to reduce the interference between adjacent texts to some extent, achieving more accurate text segmentation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the method in this study. © 2023 Lavoisier.

However, the sector face challenges because the policies have not been able to cover the headway of the financial technology. Furthermore, the finance sector perceived as lack of interactive cooperation between the stakeholder in the game, which makes its ecosystem less entrepreneurial. This research assesses policy development through a literature review on the entrepreneurial ecosystem of financial technology. Financial technology devises innovation to add more value between consumers and businesses-this study draws attention to the financial technology sector, which has matured compared to other industries. The study deployed a qualitative approach using an entrepreneurial framework by Isenberg, which discussed actors, roles, infrastructure, organizations, and actions that produce an environment that supports entrepreneurs. The results show the player and key roles among regulators' policies and consumers of financial technology, especially when it relates to the benefit perceived. There are also overlapping related to delivering support for financial technology between regulators, but lack of social performance improvement. Current disruptive technology in finance, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data, could play vital roles in achieving sustainability. The framework of the entrepreneurial ecosystem is given to provide an understanding of the policy strategy in the financial technology case. © 2022 ACM.","Entrepreneurship Ecosystem; Financial Technology; Policy Development","Finance; Public policy; Sustainable development; Entrepreneurship ecosystem; Financial technology; High potential; Indonesia; Literature reviews; Policy development; Potential growth; Qualitative approach; Social performance; Technology sectors; Ecosystems","","","","","","","Lee I., Shin Y.J., Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges, Business Horizons, 61, 1, pp. 35-46, (2018); Press Report from Bank Indonesia, 2021; Palmie M., Wincent J., Parida V., Caglar U., The evolution of the financial technology ecosystem: An introduction and agenda for future research on disruptive innovations in ecosystems, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 151, (2020); Setyowati A.B., Governing sustainable finance: Insights from Indonesia, Climate Policy, pp. 1-14, (2020); United Overseas Bank 2021.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper used data from the Bank of Ghana Payment System Statistics and Time Series Data of the Bank of Ghana from 2012 to 2021, by using autoregressive distributive lags estimation technique. Findings: The results showed that in both the long run and short run, financial technology has a significant negative impact on bank performance, indicating that fintech serves as substitutes rather than complements for Ghanaian banks. These results suggest that there must be a critical review on the interoperability policy in Ghana and that banks should take advantage of the financial technology to increase profit. Originality/value: Based on the authors’ study, no empirical work has been extensively done in the Ghanaian context by examining how financial technology serves as either a complement or substitute for domestic banking institutions. This paper focuses on exploring the key definition of financial technology in Ghana and how transactions through these media are affecting or improving the performance of banks. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bank performance;

The study collects 381 survey data from SMEs in Yaoundé and Douala, the country’s business hub, to determine how these financial technology innovations affect SMEs’ business performance. Similarly, the PLS-SEM model was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The study results show that the relationship between fintech and financial literacy was positive and significant. The findings also reveal that fintech has a positive and significant effect on SMEs performance. In addition, the results further indicate that financial literacy positively and significantly mediates the relationship between fintech services and the performance of SMEs. Therefore, the study concludes that financial literacy is an essential mechanism through which fintech services influence SMEs’ operational and financial performance in Cameroon. The study has provided a better understanding of how SMEs can improve their performance by leveraging fintech solutions through financial literacy. © 2023 by the authors.","COVID-19; financial literacy; Financial technology (Fintech); performance; SMEs","Cameroon; Douala; Littoral [Cameroon]; business; COVID-19; innovation; literacy; small and medium-sized enterprise","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (7217010477)","Funding text 1: The authors acknowledge the support of NSFC.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from a sample of 124 conventional and Islamic banks in Indonesia from 2004 to 2018. The two-step generalized methods of moments was used to estimate the system model. Findings: This study finds that FinTech startups have a detrimental effect on bank performance. This study also finds that Islamic banks have low performance compared to conventional banks. However, when FinTech startups interact with Islamic banks, this paper discovers that a greater number of FinTech startups have a positive effect on the performance of Islamic banks, particularly the peer-to-peer lending category. Additionally, this paper finds that FinTech startups improve Islamic banks' performance in both normal and crisis periods. Practical implications: This paper provides recommendations for Islamic bank management and supervisors to deal with FinTech startups during normal and crisis periods by collaborating with FinTech startups and being willing to adopt cutting-edge financial technology applications. Originality/value: This paper provides evidence of the impact of FinTech on the performance of Islamic banks, specifically on peer-to-peer lending and payment startup during the crisis and normal periods. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bank performance; Financial technology; Global financial crisis; Islamic banks","","","","","","","","Aaker D.A., Keller K.L., Consumer evaluations of brand extensions, Journal of Marketing, 54, 1, pp. 27-41, (1990); Abdul-Majid M., Falahaty M., Jusoh M., Performance of islamic and conventional banks: a META-frontier approach, Research in International Business and Finance, 42, pp. 1327-1335, (2017); Alam N., Gupta L., Zameni A., Digitalization and disruption in the financial sector, Fintech and Islamic Finance, (2019); Alam N., Hamid B.A., Tan D.T., Does competition make banks riskier in dual banking system?, Borsa Istanbul Review, 19, pp. S34-S43, (2019); Ali H., Abdullah R., Zaini M.Z., Fintech and its potential impact on islamic banking and finance industry: a case study of Brunei Darussalam and Malaysia, International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance, 2, 1, pp. 73-108, (2019); Ali M.M., Sakti M.R.P., Devi A., Developing islamic financial inclusion index for islamic banks in Indonesia: a cross-province analysis, Journal of Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance, 5, 4, pp. 691-712, (2019); Al-Salem F.H., Islamic financial product innovation, International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 2, 3, pp. 187-200, (2009); Arellano M., Bover S., Another look at the instrumental variable estimation of error-components models, Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1, pp. 29-51, (1995); Ariss R.T., Competitive conditions in islamic and conventional banking: a global perspective, Review of Financial Economics, 19, 3, pp. 101-108, (2010); Athanasoglou P.P., Brissimis S.N., Delis M.D., Bank-specific.

We find that more FinTech firms tend to enhance bank stability regardless of types of FinTech firms and the measurement of bank stability. Meanwhile, we also find that small banks and non-listed banks tend to benefit more from the presence of FinTech firms. Specifically, small banks and non-listed banks exhibit lower riskiness and higher capital ratios following an increase in the number of FinTech firms.

The study undertakes an examination of various determinants that may exert an influence on the consumer's intention. These determinants encompass financial risk, legal risk, security risk, operational risk, consumer innovativeness, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. The technology acceptance model is employed as the theoretical framework for the research. The requisite data for hypothesis testing is collected through the administration of an online survey to consumers of Islamic banks who possess a high degree of adaptability and proficiency in utilizing financial technology. The study employs the methodology of structural equation modelling with partial least squares to as-sess the proposed relationships among a sample of 399 participants. The results indicate that the acceptance of Islamic Financial technology services is contingent upon the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and consumer innovativeness. In contrast, it is observed that various other factors, namely financial risk, legal risk, security risk, and operational risk, do not hold significant sway in shaping the level of acceptance of Islamic Financial technology among users of Islamic banking services. The concept of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is expanded within the realm of Islamic financial technology, and it is utilized to examine the impact of a novel factor, specifically consumer innovativeness. The untested nature of consumer innovativeness makes this paper a valuable resource for policymakers, academics, and researchers in the future. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Consumer innovativeness; Jordan; Risk of Financial technology; TAM","","","","","","","","Al Zoubib A.

However, the renewable energy market has the characteristics of long-term return, high financing constraints, and relies on the support of an effective financial system. Using panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2018, this study uses a panel vector autoregressive model to explain the bidirectional causal relationship between innovative financial instruments and the development of renewable energy. There are also significant spatial and temporal correlations between them. At the same time, the degree of industrialization, carbon emissions, and population density also have a positive impact on renewable energy. In contrast, GDP per capita and urbanization have significant negative impacts on renewable energy. In the end, this study suggests that the government should actively promote modern financial technologies (e.g. green financing) for developing renewable energy to achieve sustainability goals. Financial institutions should further increase green credit support for the renewable energy industry. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Energy market; Green finance; Renewable energy; Vector autoregressive model","China; Energy policy; Population statistics; Power markets; Energy markets; Energy transformation; Financial system; Financing constraints; Green finance; Long-term returns; Panel data; Renewable energies; Renewable energy markets; Vector autoregressive model; alternative energy; energy market; renewable resource; technological change; technological development; Climate change","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41771568, 71471001, 71533004, 71934001, 72104028); Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS, (XDA23070400); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2016YFA0602500); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (20ZDA084)","We appreciate the associate editor Yu-Shan Su and anonymous reviewers for improving the quality of the paper.

They not only help investors diversify their portfolios to hedge against risks and enhance returns, but they also help to reduce the negative impacts of climate change. In this study, we analyze the connections among financial technology stocks, green financial assets, and energy markets using nonparametric causality-in-quantile and cross-quantilogram approaches based on the financial contagion theory. We explore whether the performance of fintech prices across booms and busts affects the prices of eco-friendly assets and energy market prices. Our results indicate that in the short run, fintech is highly directionally predictable in all markets except that of green bonds in the lower quantile. Additionally, in the bullish state, the predictability of all lag lengths is negative. Thus, price movements in fintech markets contribute to the vulnerability of the price levels of renewable and non-renewable energy stocks, green bonds, green equities, and sustainable development. Because financial contagion is closely related to asset pricing, portfolio allocation, risk measurement, and monetary policy, the findings of this paper will be informative to investors, portfolio managers, and policy makers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Causality-in-quantiles; Cross-quantilogoram correlation; Fintech; Green bonds; Quantile predictability; Renewable and nonrenewable energy","Climate change; Costs; Energy policy; Environmental protection; Investments; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Asset markets; Causality-in-quantile; Cross-quantilogoram correlation; Energy markets; Financial assets; Financial contagions; Green bond; Non-renewable energy; Quantile predictability; Renewable energies; alternative energy; correlation; energy market; financial services; industrial technology; regression analysis; Risk assessment","","","","","","","Abakah E.J.A., Alagidede P., Mensah L., Ohene-Asare K., Non-linear approach to Random Walk Test in selected African countries, Int.

Central banks worldwide struggle to deal with regulatory challenges, especially the impact of technological innovations on the financial system. Financial Technology (FinTech) innovations generally occur ahead of regulations; therefore, critical challenges for central banks, including the Bank of Ghana, is how to stay ahead of these innovations and frame supervisory mechanisms to suit the FinTech space. Understanding this problem is crucial because the central bank's regulations can hurt or support the rapid adoption of FinTech in Ghana. This paper employs a qualitative approach to critically analyze the regulation of FinTech using framework analysis based on interviews of purposively selected experts and the use of secondary data. The results highlight the need for the banking regulator to delink FinTech rules from traditional regulatory functions. The paper recommends a new FinTech dynamic regulatory approach and suggests further research based on multiple countries' data; such research enables international comparison of various FinTech regulatory regimes and examines FinTech laws and regulations to investigate the dynamic model of FinTech regulations. © 2022 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

The paper uses daily data and relies on wavelets coherency and quantile-based connectedness methods. First, our results indicate that the co-movement between FinTech and green bonds and clean energy stocks is mostly positive and strongest in the long-term but weak in the short-term, indicating a high probability of large joint losses for long-term investors and hedging opportunities of FinTech stocks for short-term investors in green financial assets. Second, the level of connectedness is stronger at both tails of the return distribution and similar in the short- and long-term while in the medium-term, normal market period total connectedness became stronger than the bearish market period connectedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, results also indicate that across all market conditions and time scales, FinTech stocks dominate most of the green financial assets as demonstrated by the net pairwise directional risk spillover. This suggests that FinTech stocks may not offer good hedging opportunities for green financial indexes. The paper provides some crucial implications based on these findings. © 2023 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy","Clean energy; Dynamic dependence; Financial technology; Green bonds; Quantile-based connectedness; Wavelets coherency","","","","","","","","Accenture, Fintech and the Evolving Landscape: Landing Points for the Industry, (2016); Adekoya O.B., Oliyide J.A., Saleem O., Adeoye H.A., Asymmetric connectedness between Google-based investor attention and the fourth industrial revolution assets: The case of FinTech and Robotics & Artificial intelligence stocks, Technol.

We utilize the notion of the developmental state to understand the policy interventions conducted by the Singaporean state to create a robust and sustainable fintech ecosystem. We show how the proper role of government in promoting fintech growth would have a considerable impact on economic growth and encourage an inclusive economy. These can be seen in three interactions between the state, market, and technology. First, the interaction between the government and financial institutions is implemented through regulations to transform the payment system into digital. Second, the government and technology interaction is implemented by establishing a framework that seeks to improve digital infrastructure and community IT capabilities. Third, the implementation of the interaction between financial institutions and technology is proven through collaboration between the two parties in creating a financial system that can facilitate greater transactions. © 2023 Author(s).","","","","","","","Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology Republic of Indonesia, (234/E4.1/AK.04, 3582/LL3/KR/2021, PT/2021); Human Resource Directorate","This paper is part of Universities’ Excellent Research Consortium for Social Sciences and Humanities research project on Digital Economy Governance Model in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 Era: Regulation, Financial Inclusion, and Technological Innovation (Model Tata Kelola Ekonomi Digital di Era Revolusi Industri 4.0: Regulasi, Inklusi Finansial, dan Inovasi Teknologi), funded by Human Resource Directorate, Directorate General of Higher Education, Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology Republic of Indonesia based on research contract No: 234/E4.1/AK.04.PT/2021 and No: 3582/LL3/KR/2021.","Quibria M.G., Ahmed S.N., Tschang T., Reyes-Macasaquit M.-L., Journal of Asian Economics, 13, pp. 811-825, (2003); Lopez-Gonzalez J., Jouanjean M.-A., OECD, pp. 1-24, (2017); Margiansyah D., JAS (Journal of ASEAN Studies), 8, (2020); Raeskyesa D.G., Lukas E.N., Jurnal Ekonomi Indonesia, 8, (2019); Tayibnapis A.Z., Wuryaningsih L.E., Gora R., International Journal of Management & Business Studies, 8, pp. 14-18, (2018); Hendrikse R., Van Meeteren M., Bassens D., Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space, 52, pp. 1516-1538, (2019); Wojcik D., Progress in Human Geography, 45, pp. 878-889, (2021); Holroyd C., Journal of Asian Public Policy, 12, pp. 15-33, (2018); Karim M.F., Irawan A.P., Mursitama T.N., Politics, (2021); Resty F.T., Aziz Y., Kaltum U., CSID Journal of Infrastructure Development, 2, pp. 177-182, (2019); Karim M.F., Contemporary Politics, 26, pp. 351-370, (2020); Karim M.F., The Pacific Review, 34, pp. 1-28, (2020); Amurwanti D.N., Karim M.F., Joanita N., South East Asia Research, 29, pp. 92-107, (2021); Lin L., SSRN Electronic Journal, pp. 1-22, (2019); Hioe W., International Council for Information Technology in Government Administration, pp. 1-12, (2001); Tan M., International Journal of Electronic Commerce, 3, pp. 105-122, (1999)","T.N.

We conducted a bibliometric analysis by employing VOSviewer application as the tool. The published documents were extracted from the Dimensions.ai website by filtering keywords “Fintech” and “COVID-19” in their titles or abstracts. 266 documents were retrieved as the dataset from January 2020 to May 2022 with none in previous years. The majority of publications were in the form of articles (n=166 or 62.4%). The most prolific university in this study was Amity University (n=6), while the most prolific country was Indonesia (n=34). The most productive country, Indonesia, occupied the last position of nine most cited states within the dataset. SSRN Electronic Journal was the most cited source with 349 times. We found that research in Indonesia was more concerned to the relationship of COVID-19 with SMEs and people’s financial condition, while research in India and China was more concerned to the development of technology implemented within financial services. This study provides broader picture of COVID-19-related fintech research during the pandemic period which may be beneficial for academics and researchers to carry out further studies in this field. © 2023, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

The article contributes to existing literature on the topic by highlighting how the current design of sandboxes is not being informed by sufficiently comprehensive empirical evidence from international examples. As well as examining relevant provisions of the European Commission’s proposals on AI sandboxes and introduction of a DLT pilot regime, the article refers to UK and Australian examples to demonstrate the varying features of sandboxes. Even if there is continued ambiguity as to the characteristics of sandboxes, broader regulatory supports, such as innovation hubs, can be vital. However, this should not diminish the need for improved clarity and transparency on sandboxes’ operations. The ability to make necessary refinements will determine how the EU’s regulatory approach to FinTech generally will evolve. © 2023 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model based on a risk-benefit approach was adopted based on the theory of reasoned action, the theory of planned behaviour and technology acceptance models. The partial least squares structural equation modelling method was used to test the proposed model and estimate the relationship between constructs. The results are used to develop strategies, which are then categorised based on the integration of an importance-performance analysis and the Kano model. Findings: The results show that trust, economic benefit and convenience significantly influence users to adopt Fintech services, whereas privacy awareness, financial risk and legal risk factors affect user trust. A strategy for consumer protection against security threats and financial losses warrants the highest priority for improvement. Practical implications: The findings of this study can help Fintech product managers classify their service improvements and help regulators make the appropriate policy decisions related to customer security and the adoption of Fintech. Social implications: There are some limitations of this research that should be noted. First, the research target respondents were millennials who have been statistically proven to have the highest affinity in using Fintech services. Second, the Fintech services used in this research were only mobile payments, peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Future research could expand the number of research respondents to improve research validity, including other Fintech services or focus on one Fintech service at a time for targeted results and consider moderation variables, such as customer experience with Fintech services based on age and gender. Originality/value: This study contributes to the development of new frameworks for evaluating Fintech adoption intention based on a risk-benefit approach. It also presents strategy recommendations to be implemented by Indonesian Fintech companies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption intention; Business strategy; Fintech; IPA-Kano; Modelling;

We find that the development of fintech mitigates the dampening effect of macroeconomic uncertainty on commercial banks' proactive risk-taking. Specifically, fintech plays a mitigating role by motivating commercial banks to issue loans and hold transactional financial assets. With the increase of commercial banks’ proactive risk-taking, the mitigation effect of fintech monotonically diminishes. This mitigating effect is heterogeneous across different types of commercial banks, as it is relatively weak for banks with high capital adequacy ratios and large state-owned banks. © 2023 The Authors","Digital transformation; Macroeconomic uncertainty; Proactive risk-taking","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (72101278, 72271010)","Fang Liang and Zhuo Huang acknowledge the funding support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 72101278 , 72271010 ).

The research design is qualitative and secondary source analysis is conducted. Secondary data is collected from relevant journal articles, research papers, editorials, websites and official documents. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that different key drivers played an influential role in the progress of the Fintech industry in Malaysia. Financial literacy programs and Malaysia Stack are some notable initiatives that support the Fintech progress in Malaysia. A range of Fintech businesses is operating in Malaysia that are transforming different banking services including payments solutions, lending personal loans, credit cards, personal finance management solutions and one-stop-shop online banking. Underserved populations, flexible regulatory environment and increased level of interest of state authorities are some of the critical aspects for the future progress of Fintech business in Malaysia. The research paper explains the role of Fintech businesses in the Malaysian banking industry. Many have viewed Fintech as a disruptive technology, however, this study highlighted that Malaysian banking services are transformed by Fintech business and there are still opportunities for the progress of the Fintech industry in Malaysia. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.","Banking; financial technology; Malaysia; transformation","","","","","","","","Khanzode K.C.A., Sarode R.D., Advantages and Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: A Literature Review, International Journal of Library & Information Science (IJLIS), 9, 1, (2020); Bilan Y., Rubanov P., Vasylieva T.A., Lyeonov S., The influence of industry 4.0 on financial services: Determinants of alternative finance development, Polish Journal of Management Studies, 3, 2, (2019); Mosteanu N.R., Faccia A., Digital systems and new challenges of financial management–Fintech, XBRL, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Quality-Access to Success Journal, 21, 174, pp. 159-166, (2020); Pant S.K., Fintech: Emerging Trends, Telecom Business Review, 13, 1, (2020); Mention A.L., The future of Fintech, Research-Technology Management, 62, 4, pp. 59-63, (2019); Qi Y., Xiao J., Fintech: AI powers financial services to improve people's lives, Communications of the ACM, 61, 11, pp. 65-69, (2018); Alsmadi A.A., Shuhaiber A., Alhawamdeh L.N., Alghazzawi R., Al-Okaily M., Twenty Years of Mobile Banking Services Development and Sustainability: A Bibliometric Analysis Overview (2000– 2020), Sustainability, 14, (2022); Alzoubi M., Kasasbeh H.A., The investment-saving puzzle in mena countries: Disentangling gross saving, Ekonomski Pregled, 72, 5, pp. 774-795, (2021); Vijai C., Fintech in Malaysia–Opportunities and Challenges, SAARJ Journal on Banking & Insurance Research (SJBIR), 8, 4, (2019); Oudat M.S., Alsmadi A.A., Alrawashdeh N.M., Foreign direct investment and economic growth in Jordan: An empirical research using the bounds test for cointegration, Revista Finanzas y Politica Economica, 11, 1, pp. 55-63, (2019); Rifai F., Ramadan B.M., Yousif A.S.H., Al-Dweiri M., Alsmadi A.A., The impact of using outsourcing strategy by humanitarian organizations on logistical performance: An empirical investigation from a developing country, Journal of Governance and Regulation, 10, 2, pp. 118-133, (2021); Etman M., Ibrahim N., Lutfi A., Effect of Adopting the Criterion of Revenue from Contracts with Clients on Accounting Conservatism, Global Economic Revolutions, pp. 55-67, (2021); Victor S.R., Smarter Aadhaar Card For A Smarter And Meticulous Malaysia, PalArch's Journal of Archaeology of Egypt/Egyptology, 17, 7, pp. 10085-10105, (2020); Almaiah M.

This can lead to improved Financial Services (FSs) for clients. This research examines the impact of FinTech characteristics on innovation and how they can transform the quality of financial services (QFS) based on the Theoretical FinTech DIPLOMA Model (Digital, Innovation, Pricing, Learning, Openness, Modernity, Agility) in the Jordanian banking sector. A descriptive analysis approach was applied in the study. Convenience sampling was applied to choose the participants, consisting of 208 employees from all of managerial levels in Jordanian banks. The findings revealed that the DIPLOMA model positively affects the QFS in the banking context. However, it has been found that Learning does not significantly affect the QFS. Based on the findings, it is recommended that future research is carried out across other sectors. In addition, a comparative study might give more information and insights about FinTech applications and their influence on the QFS. © 2022 NSP.","Banking Sector; DIPLOMA Model; Financial Services Quality; Financial Technology; Transformation","","","","","","","","Schueffel P., The concise FinTech compendium, (2017); Karagiannaki A., Vergados G., Fouskas K., The impact of digital transformation in the financial services industry: Insights from an open innovation initiative in FinTech in Greece, The 11th Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (MCIS), (2017); Stewart H., How disruptive are FinTech and digital for banks and regulators?, Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, 12, 3, pp. 217-222, (2019); Hendrikse R., Meeteren M., Bassens D., Strategic coupling between finance, technology and the state: Cultivating a FinTech ecosystem for incumbent finance, Economy and Space, 52, 8, pp. 1-23, (2019); Cassis Y., Wojcik D., International financial centres after the global financial crisis and Brexit, (2018); Das S., The future of FinTech, Financial Management Association International, (2019); Wamba S., Kamdjoug J., Bawack R., Keogh J., Bitcoin, Blockchain and FinTech: A systematic review and case studies in the supply chain, Production Planning & Control Journal, 31, 2–3, pp. 115-142, (2019); Adomavicius G., Bockstedt J., Gupta A., Kauffman J., Making sense of technology trends in the Information Technology landscape, MIS Quarterly, 32, 4, pp. 779-809, (2008); Dhawan S., Nazneen A., Innovation approaches to estimate the financial performance of the banking sector: The case for Saudi Arabia, Marketing and Management of Innovations, 2, pp. 252-260, (2021); Anagnostopoulos I., FinTech and Regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, 19, pp. 7-25, (2018); Rabbani M., Bashar A., Nawaz N., Karim S., Ali M., Rahiman H., Alam M., Exploring the role of Islamic FinTech in combating the aftershocks of COVID-19: The open social innovation of the Islamic financial system, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 7, 2, (2021); Brandl B., Hornuf L., Where did FinTechs come from, and where do they go?

As a mediating variable, the study also examined the mediated effect of financial constraints, tax rebates, and government subsidies. Design/Methodology/Approach- The information was extracted from annual reports of publicly traded textile companies from 2011 to 2021. The quantitative research method and longitudinal research design were utilized. STATA software was used to conduct a panel regression analysis on the data. Findings- The findings suggest that financial technology positively and substantially impacts environmental and social governance. The other mediating effects also indicate that financial constraints, tax reimbursements, and government subsidies mediate between financial technology and environmental and social governance significantly and positively. Implications- The results indicate that financial technology substantially and positively affects environmental and social governance. The other mediating effects suggest that financial constraints, tax reimbursements, and government subsidies mediate significantly and positively between financial technology and environmental and social governance. Originality- This mediating effect is pioneering, particularly in the context of Saudi Arabia, as indicated by the research with the extended mediating model, which demonstrates significant contributions to previous studies. © 2023 asociación Cuadernos de economía.","Financial technology; Saudi Arabia; tax rebate; Textile","","","","","","Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University; King Faisal University, KFU, (3556)","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [Grant No.3556]'.","Abeysekera A.

It also aims to determine the priorities that need to be considered in organizations in various conditions through fintech-based training. This is an experimental research with training given to the experimental group and none to the control. A paired-samples t-test analysis technique was used to determine the significant differences in the same group under different conditions. The result showed that fintech-based training is important in supporting organizations in the business groups that received training and those that have significant differences. Therefore, this training is needed, especially during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19 pandemic; experimental design; financial technology; organizational support","","","","","","Universitas Ciputra Surabaya","This research was funded by Universitas Ciputra Surabaya.","Ahmedova S., Factors for Increasing the Competitiveness of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Bulgaria, Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 195, pp. 1104-1112, (2015);

Employing provincial panel data from 2011–2020, we empirically investigate the impact of financial technology on energy efficiency and the role of industrial ecology in the development of financial technology to enhance energy efficiency. The findings reveal that financial technology can significantly enhance energy efficiency and promote it by improving industrial ecology. Furthermore, industrial ecology can act as a crucial channel for financial technology to promote energy efficiency. Specifically, an increase of one standard deviation in financial technology is associated with a 33.1% surge in energy efficiency on average. Financial technology has made a significant contribution to the improvement of energy efficiency in all regions, albeit with regional heterogeneity.

Design/methodology/approach: A survey was carried out, and a judgemental sampling method was used. Moreover, over 200 responses were gathered from individuals that were bank account holders. Besides, the literature on the factors that influence an individual acceptance towards FinTech using the UTAUT model was also reviewed as an effort to contribute towards the factors that are significant in predicting the acceptance of FinTech services. Findings: The results of the study revealed that performance expectancy and effort expectancy are the main factors in determining the acceptance of FinTech services. Moreover, consumer innovativeness plays an important role in the acceptance of FinTech by bank users. In contrast, social influence and facilitating conditions were not the determinants of FinTech acceptance in Pakistan. Research limitations/implications: This study not only contributed to the theoretical extensions but also to practical implications, which would benefit the community of FinTech service providers in Pakistan. Practical implications: The limitations of this study were two but are not limited to, firstly, the respondents which were taken among bank customers in Pakistan, confining its contribution to the narrowed perspective of Pakistan. Besides, this study also considers its contributions towards the use of the UTAUT in which the factors examined were specific, which may elucidate that the generalization of the findings only includes FinTech, where the UTAUT comes into play. This study is an eye-opener for the merging perspective of both the UTAUT and FinTech. Originality/value: UTAUT is extended in the context of FinTech. Consumer innovativeness is incorporated in the context of the UTAUT model. Consumer innovativeness is yet to be tested and for that this study is a useful reference for academicians, policymakers and future researchers. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business systems;

Digital disruption has an impact on bank business models as well as conventional businesses as a result of changed customer behavior. This paper examines the impact of financial technology on the Indian conventional banking industry using a structured questionnaire filled out by 300 customers’ of a bank selected using simple random sampling. For hypothesis testing, the statistical technique of regression analysis is used.In order to identify the impact of financial technology on the banking industry, the value propositions that influence the adoption of financial technology or banking products are analysed using importance and usefulness criteria such as customer satisfaction, net promotion score, promotion, ease of use, etc. The results show that banks have been positively impacted by the use of financial technology as it can now enhance their value proposition which includes improved service quality, marketing and a wide range of merchants. The research has implications for the banking industry that can make the services easily accessible for customers and improve their value proposition. Furthermore, customers are aware that the banking industry uses financial technology which can make their work easier too. The literature in the field of financial technology is limited in terms of theory and the practical issues are being improved with easy adoption and proper marketing needs in the research. This will improve and guide future research in the same area. © 2023 by the authors.","Banks; Consumer behavior; Digital disruption; Financial technology; Net promoter score; Payment gateway","","","","","","","","Lee I., Shin Y.

The research paper explores financial technology's effect on poverty alleviation in the Asian countries. The dataset was collected from Asian countries between 2010 and 2021. A web search technology and frequent word analytics tool are employed to conceptualize variables, and after that, each selected region's financial technology index is constructed. Given the variation in poverty across selected regions, a novel approach of vector quantile regression is used to quantify the effect of financial technology on poverty allocation. The suggested method's parametric estimators are employed as ""location""measurements of poverty. The findings of this research reveal that despite an uneven index of financial technology development across Asian economies, financial technology significantly impacts poverty alleviation in every selected Asian economy. Furthermore, financial technology strongly impacts poverty alleviation in developing economies than emerging economies of Asian countries. Considering the above findings, practitioners, governments and policy-makers need to foster advanced financial technology mechanisms, specifically in developing economies of the selected Asian economies.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Fintech; institutional quality; poverty alleviation; quantile regression; support vector regression","Asia; developing world; finance; financial system; Internet; poverty alleviation; support vector machine","","","","","","","Adeleye BN, Gershon O, Ogundipe A, Owolabi O, Ogunrinola I, Adediran O, Comparative investigation of the growth-poverty-inequality trilemma in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin American and Caribbean countries, Heliyon, (2020); Aghaei M, Lawell CYC Lin, Energy, economic growth, inequality, and poverty in Iran, Singapore Economic Review, (2020); Ahmadian-Yazdi F, Mesgarani M, Roudari S, Natural resource rents and social capital interaction: New evidence on the role of financial development, Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy and Management, 24, 1, (2022); Awaworyi Churchill S, Smyth R, Ethnic diversity, energy poverty and the mediating role of trust: Evidence from household panel data for Australia, Energy Economics, (2020); Bartiaux F, Day R, Lahaye W, Energy poverty as a restriction of multiple capabilities: A systemic approach for Belgium, Journal of Human Development and Capabilities, 22, 2, pp. 270-291, (2021); Cavallaro F, Multi-criteria decision aid to assess concentrated solar thermal technologies, Renewable Energy, 34, 7, pp. 1678-1685, (2009); Chang L, Gan X, Mohsin M, Studying corporate liquidity and regulatory responses for economic recovery in COVID-19 crises, Econ Anal Policy, 76, pp. 211-225, (2022); Chang L, Moldir M, Zhang Y, Nazar R, Asymmetric impact of green bonds on energy efficiency: Fresh evidence from quantile estimation, Util Policy, 80, (2023); Chang L, Zhang Q, Liu H, Digital finance innovation in green manufacturing: A bibliometric approach, Environ Sci Pollut Res, (2022); Chang L, Saydaliev HB, Meo MS, Mohsin M, How renewable energy matter for environmental sustainability: Evidence from top-10 wind energy consumer countries of European Union, Sustain Energy, Grids Networks, 31, (2022); Che X, Zhu B, Wang P, Assessing global energy poverty: An integrated approach, Energy Policy, (2021); Darling S, Harvey B, Hickey GM, Advancing pluralism in impact assessment through research capacity: Lessons from the Yukon Territory, Canada, Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy and Management, 24, (2022); Diniz LL, Machado PM, Lima JS, Costa LL, Da Costa ID, Zalmon IR, Coastal scenery quality: A management tool for sandy beaches, Journal of Environmental Assessment Policy and Management, 24, 1, (2022); Fang W, Liu Z, Surya Putra AR, Role of research and development in green economic growth through renewable energy development: Empirical evidence from South Asia, Renew Energy, 194, (2022); Garcia Ochoa R, Graizbord Ed B, Privation of energy services in Mexican households: An alternative measure of energy poverty, Energy Research and Social Science, (2016); Ikram M, Sroufe R, Mohsin M, Solangi YA, Shah SZA, Shahzad F, Does CSR influence firm performance?

The results show that the regression coefficient of financial technology to big data industry is significantly positive at the significance level of 5%, it indicates that the financial technology can directly promote the development of big data industry. In the control variables, the regional technological innovation ability and the degree of opening to the outside world play a significant role in promoting the big data industry. In addition, the big data enterprise financing constraints have a partial mediating effect, the mediating effect account for 12.27% of the total effect, it indicates that the financial technology can indirectly promote the development of big data industry by alleviating the big data enterprise financing constraints.  © 2021 ACM.

In conclusion, we find that the Chinese stock market is more dominated by retail investors, but the United States owns more stocks, mostly held by institutional investors, and has a better financial mindset. The behavior of investors in the Chinese stock market is mainly the excessive speculation of investors in the Chinese market. This is one of the reasons for the many fluctuations in the Chinese stock market. Due to the speculative nature of China's stock market, the floating ratio reflects the management mechanism of China's stock market and helps to observe the correlation with the U.S. stock market. And technology and digitalization affect the trading of the stock market. This research is correlational, and there is no causality implied.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","","Commerce; Financial markets; Fintech; China's Stock Markets; Chinese markets; Chinese stock market; Institutional investors; Management mechanisms; Investments","","","","","","","Yufan Y., Comparison and analysis of Chinese and United States stock market, Journal of Financial Risk Management, 9, 1, (2020); Huadong L., Analysis of the differences and linkage between Chinese and American stock markets, J.

This paper also identifies the flaws in the existing regulations and policies on Fintech, and it also proposes an ideal framework for a fintech law as a strategy to strengthen consumer protection and to accelerate the growth of the digital economy in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This is normative research with a legal approach. Data were collected through a literature study and analyzed using legal norm method. Findings: The promising potential and growth of the fintech industry in Indonesia need to be supported by a sound legal framework in the form of Indonesian Law. In regards to fintech, Indonesia does not yet have a specific law on fintech. Existing regulations in the Bank of Indonesia Regulations (PBI) and Indonesia Financial Services Authority Regulations (POJK) only regulate the technical aspects of the industry, thus providing a less sound legal power. Bank of Indonesia (BI) and Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK) have limited authority in the making of regulations and the regulations produced by these institutions cannot stipulate criminal provisions. This results in inadequate consumer protection measures. The Investment Alert Task Force reported 2,018 illegal P2P lending, 472 illegal investment companies and 69 illegal pawnbrokers. The accumulation of online lending transactions in December 2019 reached a total of IDR81.50tn, seeing a 259.56% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the amount of bad debt reached IDR13.6tn, seeing a 169.48% increase. These reasons illustrate how urgently Indonesia needs Fintech Law. Research limitations/implications: This research only examines the existing Fintech regulations in Indonesia. The approach method used is normative legal research. Practical implications: This research is expected to be useful for The House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia (DPR), the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, the Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Bank of Indonesia (BI) in drafting the Fintech Law. Social implications: This research is expected to increase protection for consumers, investors and providers of fintech services and accelerate the growth of the digital economy in Indonesia. Originality/value: Regulating fintech in the Indonesian Law is meant to give legal certainty and better legal protection for consumers, investors and providers of fintech services. Seeing that the value of the Indonesian digital economy in 2019 has reached USD40bn (approximately IDR586tn), Indonesia is philosophically, juridically and sociologically in urgent need of Fintech Law. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business law; Digital economy; Financial technology; Financial technology law; Indonesia; Law and regulation; Law and regulation","","","","","","","","Creating enabling fintech ecosystems: the role of regulators, 32, (2020); Arner D.W., Barberis J., Buckley R.P., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, 3, pp. 373-415, (2017); Arner D.W., Zetzsche D.A., Buckley R.P., Barberis J.N., Fintech and regtech: Enabling innovation while preserving financial stability, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2018); Batunanggar S., Fintech development and regulatory frameworks in Indonesia, (2019); Carmona A.F., Lombardo A.G.Q., Pastor R.R., Quiros C.T., Garcia J.V., Munoz D.R., Martin L.C., Competition issues in the area of financial technology (fintech), directorate general for internal policies policy department a: economic and scientific policy, Juli 2018, (2018); Chatterjee S., Is data privacy a fundamental right in India?

The Chinese government explicitly regards the development of financial technology (Fintech) as an essential strategy for improving banking performance. However, the debate on the impact of costly Fintech innovation on Chinese banking performance has not been resolved. This study therefore applies the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to define the metafrontier cost Malmquist productivity index (CMM) under variable returns to scale (VRS) in order to analyze the factors and identify the sources of changes in cost-side productivity and their economic implications. The results show that the average CMM score was 1.0626, implying a 6.26% improvement in the cost Malmquist productivity during the study period. The results of implementing the system-GMM model also indicate that the greater the banks’ share of mobile device transactions and the larger the banks’ third-party payment transactions volume, the higher the cost productivity growth rate. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Data envelopment analysis (DEA);

While a large body of previous research has focused on initial adoption and consumer willingness to use these products, little research explores the continued use of these products beyond the initial adoption phase. In particular, special attention should be paid to how users‘ trust and perceptions of privacy and security affect continued use behavior. This paper integrates the expectation confirmation model of information system continuance (ECM-ISC), the information system success model (ISSM) and the security and trust literatures to investigate continued use of online financial technology. To test the research model, we collected 398 valid questionnaires from Ant Credit Pay users. The research results show that system and service quality positively impact users‘ expectation confirmation, while information quality has no significant impact. Expectation confirmation and perceived usefulness positively affect user satisfaction. Moreover, the user‘s perception of privacy and security plays a vital role in user satisfaction. Satisfaction and perceived trust jointly promote users‘ continuance behaviors. Findings of this study indicates the importance of the information system success factors and security factors due to their influence on the continued use of Fintech products. This conclusion has implications for enterprises in improving the product qualities and enhancing the degree of security to meet user needs. © 2021.

In this study, researchers attempted to suggest some directions to policymakers towards furthering the initiatives for financial inclusion. The objectives are to explore user behaviour for technology adaptation of financial transactions. Design/ Methodology-A systematic literature review was conducted by using a method suggested by Cook and West (2012). The articles were selected between 2001 to 2020. Keywords such as ‘digital technology’ and Financial Inclusion (FI) were chosen for study. Full text articles in English language from SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google scholar were considered. A conceptual framework has been suggested based on the literature review, which can help future researchers to examine the current issues and challenges in the financial technology and digital technology field. Findings/Conclusion-The overall review of existing literature available on the topic signifies that digital technology is the driver of FI and economic growth. However, there are some gaps noted on which future studies can focus. Originality/Contribution/Value-In the literature review, research papers deal with problems, factors, and gaps in the use of digital technology. Thus, there is a need for more research on this topic. It is a unique study in the context of emerging economies. © 2022, University of Wollongong.

In fact, the administrative process in Indonesian hospitals is still complex, not well organized, and has not used technology properly. This study aims to analyses the effect of financial technology (fintech) and financial literacy on the efficiency of the Indonesian healthcare industry during the Covid-19 pandemic era. This study uses a quantitative method with an online survey for data collecting. The purposive sampling was applied to get 225 respondents. The dependent variable is financial technology usage, which is measured through three perceptions of fintech users: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and internet usage of all healthcare service users in the healthcare industry in Indonesia. The moderating variable adopted in this study is financial literacy, which is a combination of the understanding (knowledge), skills, attitude, and ability to make sound judgement and decision (behaviour) on personal financial matters resulting in individual financial well-being. This study uses the SEM (Structural Equation Modelling) method to analyses the efficiency of the healthcare industry. The study results show that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness have an effect on fintech; fintech has a positive effect on efficiency, where financial literacy also strengthens the effect of fintech on efficiency in the Indonesia healthcare industry during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results of this study are expected to make a significant contribution to the development of the healthcare industry that currently becomes a top priority, given the urgency in handling public health, including Covid-19 patients. Additionally, this research provides a theoretical contribution by increasing fintech literacy in the healthcare industry in increasing efficiency during the Covid-19 pandemic. While practical contribution is about giving new insight to consider the technology in improving management process in healthcare industry. ©The Author(s) 2022.","Covid-19; Efficiency; Financial literacy; Financial technology; Healthcare industry","","","","","","","","Abbasi K., Alam A., Anna M., Luu T., Huynh D., Technological Forecasting & Social Change FinTech, SME efficiency and national culture: Evidence from OECD countries, Technological Forecasting & Social Change, (2021); Ahmad R., Salah K., Jayaraman R., Yaqoob I., Ellahham S., Omar M., The role of blockchain technology in telehealth and telemedicine, International Journal of Medical Informatics, 148, (2021); Al-kahtani N., Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine HIMSS Saudi Arabia Conference and Exhibition 2018: Reimagining Healthcare in Saudi Arabia, Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, 171, (2019); Al M.

This paper explores the effects of fintech on poverty alleviation in the provinces of China. The sample includes data for 31 provinces for the period of 2011 to 2020. To reflect the technological innovation of finance, we first use web crawler technology and word frequency analysis to collect variables, and then construct a fintech index for each province. Due to the heterogeneity in poverty among various provincial regions, we further propose a novel sparse support vector quantile regression to examine the effectiveness of fintech on poverty reduction within individual Chinese provinces. Quantile estimators of the proposed method are used as empirical “location” measures for poverty. The empirical results show that although the development of fintech index is uneven among provincial regions, fintech effectively reduces poverty in every province. Moreover, the positive effects of fintech on poverty alleviation are much stronger in low-income provinces than in high-income provinces. Therefore, policy-makers and practitioners should build more digital financial technology systems, especially in Chinese low-income provinces. © 2022 The Authors","Fintech; Poverty alleviation; Quantile regression; Support vector regression","","","","","","Philosophy and Social Sciences Leading Talent Training Project of Zhejiang Province, (21YJRC07-1YB)","This work is supported by Philosophy and Social Sciences Leading Talent Training Project of Zhejiang Province (No. 21YJRC07-1YB ).","Anand P., Rastogi R., Chandra S., A new asymmetric ϵ-insensitive pinball loss function based support vector quantile regression model, Applied Soft Computing, 94, (2020); Appiah-Otoo I., Song N., The impact of fintech on poverty reduction: Evidence from China, Sustainability, 13, 9, (2021); Bu Y., Li H., Wu X., Effective regulations of fintech innovations: The case of China, Economics of Innovation and New Technology, pp. 1-19, (2021); Chen L., From fintech to finlife: The case of fintech development in China, China Economic Journal, 9, 3, pp. 225-239, (2016); Chen M.A., Wu Q., Yang B., How valuable is FinTech innovation?, The Review of Financial Studies, 32, 5, pp. 2062-2106, (2019); Cheng M., Qu Y., Does bank fintech reduce credit risk?

A typology of FinTech organisations","2022","European Journal of Innovation Management","","","","","","","0","10.1108/EJIM-07-2022-0359","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142932442&doi=10.1108%2fEJIM-07-2022-0359&partnerID=40&md5=ed8aa82af79d90fd194be463ba685f3d","University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand","Ranabahu N., University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand","Purpose: This paper explores how financial technology (FinTech) organisations address poverty-related challenges when providing digital financial services. Employing the conceptual foundation of the liability of poorness (i.e. literacy gaps, a scarcity mindset, intense non-business pressures and a lack of financial slack), this paper explores the innovative strategies that FinTechs use to address these liabilities and promote entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses detailed case data collected from three FinTech organisations operating in one South Asian country. Findings: FinTech organisations' innovative strategies reflect a combination of “high touch” (human) vs “low touch” (digital) solutions. All the organisations simplified internal systems or procedures to accommodate customers. The degree to which the three organisations adopted each of the identified strategies shows an emerging typology of FinTechs; that is, innovators with high digital interactions, a mix of digital-human interactions and high human interactions. Research limitations/implications: The paper develops a typology which categorises FinTech innovative strategies. The typology highlights strategies pro-poor FinTechs use and explains the types of entrepreneurial support innovative organisations provide for their customers. Both the typology and the innovative strategies contribute to enhanced financial inclusion and entrepreneurial promotion amongst the poor. Originality/value: The originality of the paper comes from its focus on FinTechs' innovative pro-poor strategies. Existing studies typically address the technology-side of innovations. In contrast, this paper combines innovative strategies with the liability of poorness to identify issues associated with financial inclusion. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","FinTech; Human vs digital interactions; Organisational innovation; Strategy; The liability of poorness","","","","","","","","Agwu M.E., Can technology bridge the gap between rural development and financial inclusions?, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, 33, 2, pp. 123-133, (2021); Antoniadou V., Collecting, organizing and analyzing multimodal data sets: the contributions of CAQDAS, Qualitative Approaches to Research on Plurilingual Education, pp. 435-450, (2017); Aziz A., Naima U., Rethinking digital financial inclusion: evidence from Bangladesh, Technology in Society, 64, (2021); Baker L., Everyday experiences of digital financial inclusion in India's ‘micro-entrepreneur’ paratransit services, Environment and Planning: Economy and Space, 53, 7, pp. 1810-1827, (2021); Banerjee A., Duflo E., The economic lives of the poor, The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, 1, pp. 141-168, (2007); Bateman M., Duvendack M., Loubere N., Is fin-tech the new panacea for poverty alleviation and local development?

Computer big data has a wide range of applications in all aspects In order to analyze the comprehensive impact of financial technology and financial openness on the risks of commercial banks, this paper adopts the data of 126 commercial banks in China from 2011 to 2018 to conduct empirical analysis by using systematic GMM method, double-fixed effect model and mediating effect model. The results show that, in general, financial technology has a negative impact on the risks of commercial banks, that is, the “technology spillover effect” and “competitive effect” brought by financial technology to commercial banks are greater than, and the positive impact is greater than the negative impact. Opening up the financial sector would make banks more risky. Fintech has a masking effect. Although the opening of the financial industry will increase the risk taking of banks, the opening of the financial industry will promote the development of fintech, which in turn will reduce the risk taking of banks. Therefore, the financial industry needs to pay attention to the risks of banks in the process of opening up. Banks can increase investment in the research and development of blockchain and artificial intelligence technology and improve the development level of financial technology. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bank risk; Financial sector openness; Fintech; The mediation effect","Economic and social effects; Risk assessment; Risk management; 'current; Bank risk; Commercial bank; Financial industry; Financial sector openness; Financial sectors; Risk taking; Technology spillover effect; Technology-based; The mediation effect; Big data","","","","","","","Lapavitsas C., Santos P.L., Globalization and contemporary banking: On the impact of new technology, Contrib.

Hence, we aim to investigate the impact of FinTech on health outcomes in Asian economies over the period 2007–2019. The empirical estimation of the study is based on the 2SLS and GMM techniques. The outcomes confirmed the negative impact of ATMs and Debit cards on the infant mortality rate in both 2SLS and GMM models. Whereas, ATMs and Debit cards positively impact the life expectancy of people living in Asian economies irrespective of the estimation technique. Similarly, the association between the Internet and infant mortality rate is negative; whereas, this association is positive in the context of the Internet and life expectancy both with 2SLS and GMM. From these findings, we can confirm that the amalgamation of technology and the financial sector helps to improve health outcomes in Asian economies.

Previous studies have assessed how SMEs might address their financing issues from a demand side. This study is inclined toward the supply side of financing. We aimed to determine how FinTech can counteract the effects of lending costs, information asymmetry, and credit risk management to influence the flow of bank credit to agro-processing SMEs and other entrepreneurs. A total of 399 questionnaires were collected for statistical analysis using partial least square structural equation modeling (Smart PLS). We demonstrate that FinTech as a moderator reduces the negative effects of information asymmetry and credit risk management to allow agro-processing SMEs to obtain more loans. Policymakers can use the findings of this study to improve banks' financial technology in lending activities for the sustainability of entrepreneurial activities. © 2022, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

The attitudes of the end-users tend to play a great role in the adoption of any technology. This paper investigated the factors influencing the attitudes and intention of the end-users towards using Fintech services within the purview of an expanded technology acceptance model (TAM). The study was conducted on 467 end-users in Lagos State, Nigeria, using structural equation model analysis. The results revealed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, service trust and social influence have positive and significant impact on users’ attitude towards Fintech service with path weights of 0.55, 0.63, 0.27 and 0.41, respectively, at 1% level of significance. In addition to this, users’ attitude towards Fintech services is positively significant in influencing the adoption of Fintech service with path weight of 0.85 at 1% level of significance. The study suggests that more investment is made in Fintech innovations and that banks sensitize the general public using social media, TV and radio stations. Further, proper regulatory measures by the relevant regulatory agency must be implemented to instil confidence and trust in the end-users. This would boost the level of adoption of Fintech among the end-users in Nigeria. © 2020 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.","end-users; financial technology; intention to adopt;

The study finds that both the marketization process and FinTech can facilitate increased R&D innovation and foreign equity investment by companies but discourage investment in their fixed assets, and FinTech has a ""U-shaped effect""on corporate R&D and innovation. At the same time, the marketization process and FinTech show different threshold effects on corporate investment preferences with government subsidies as the threshold variable. It is found that market-based processes in small-scale enterprises are better able to promote investment in innovative R&D by companies - the marketization process for large enterprises has a greater impact on outward equity investment in the heterogeneity analysis. From the perspective of the nature of property rights, it is found that the marketization process and FinTech have a greater impact on non-state enterprises. As a result, in an era of rapid FinTech development, this paper enriches the relevant research on the impact of the marketization process on corporate investment preferences, which has important practical significance for policy formulation and corporate future development.  © 2022 Yongkui Li and Xiaokang Liu.","","","","","","","","","Lin Y.F., New structural economics - A framework for reconstructing development economics, China Economic Quarterly, 10, 1, pp. 1-32, (2011); Fan G., Wang X.L., Zhang L.W., Zhu H.P., Report on the relative process of marketization in China by regions, Economic Research Journal, 3, pp. 9-18+89, (2003); Fang J.X., Ownership, marketization process and capital allocation efficiency, Management World, 11, pp. 27-35, (2007); Wan L.Y., Rule of law environment and corporate investment efficiency - An empirical study based on Chinese listed companies, Journal of Financial Research, 12, pp. 154-166, (2013); Zhang J., Li K., Liu Z.B., Market transformation and firm productivity - An empirical study in China, China Economic Quarterly, 10, 2, pp. 571-602, (2011); Xu X.X., Wang X.B., Shu Y., Local officials and economic growth - Evidence from the exchange of governors and provincial party secretaries in China, Economic Research Journal, 9, pp. 18-31, (2007); Fan G., Wang X.L., Ma G.R., The contribution of China's marketization process to economic growth, Economic Research Journal, 46, 9, pp. 4-16, (2011); Sun Z., Liu F.W., Li Z.Q., Marketization, government intervention and the maturity structure of corporate debt - Empirical evidence from listed companies in China, Economic Research Journal, 5, pp. 52-63, (2005); Firth M., Lin C., Liu P., Wong S.M., Inside the black box: Bank credit allocation in China's private sector, Journal of Banking & Finance, 33, 6, pp. 1144-1155, (2009); Jiang F.X., Huang Z.Z., Marketization process and dynamic adjustment of capital structure, Management World, 3, pp. 124-134+167, (2011); Fang J.X., Marketization process and the improvement of capital allocation efficiency, Economic Research Journal, 5, pp. 50-61, (2006); Hao Y., Liu X., Marketization process and R&D investment of listed companies: Based on the perspective of property rights characteristics, Science Research Management, 31, 4, pp. 81-90, (2010); Bergstrom F., Capital subsidies and the performance of firms, Small Business Economics, 14, 3, pp. 183-193, (2000); Tang Q.Q., Luo D.L., An empirical study of government subsidy motives and their effects - Empirical evidence from Chinese listed companies, Journal of Financial Research, 6, pp. 149-163, (2007); Cheng L.W., Sun W., The influence of marketization degree on the allocation efficiency of independent innovation - Analysis of panel data of high-tech industry based on Cost-Malmquist index, China Soft Science, 5, pp. 128-137, (2012); Cooper R.W., Haltiwanger J.C., On the nature of capital adjustment costs, The Review of Economic Studies, 73, 3, pp. 611-633, (2006); Dang L., Yang R.L., Yang J.D., Anti-corruption and corporate innovation: An explanation based on political association, China Industrial Economy, 7, pp. 146-160, (2015); Li C.T., Yan, Song M., Yang W., FinTech and corporate innovation-evidence from NSS listed companies, China Industrial Economics, 1, pp. 81-98, (2020); Li J., Wu Y., Xiao J.J., The impact of digital finance on household consumption: Evidence from China, Economic Modelling, 86, pp. 317-326, (2020); Qian X.S., Tang Y.L., Fang S., Did the reform of security interest system reduce the cost of corporate debt financing - Empirical evidence from a natural experiment of China's Property Law, Journal of Financial Research, 7, pp. 115-134, (2019); Kraft H., Schwartz E., Weiss F., Growth options and firm valuation, European Financial Management, 24, 2, pp. 209-238, (2018); Tang X.S., Zhou X.S., Ma R.J., Government intervention, GDP growth and over-investment in local state-owned enterprises, Journal of Financial Research, 8, pp. 33-48, (2010); Shao M., Bao Q., Government subsidies and firm productivity - An empirical analysis based on industrial firms in China, China Industrial Economics, 7, pp. 70-82, (2012); Mao Q.L., Xu J.Y., The impact of government subsidies on firms' new product innovation - A perspective based on the ""moderate interval"" of subsidy intensity, China Industrial Economics, 6, pp. 94-107, (2015); Guo F., Wang Y.P., Traditional financial foundation, knowledge threshold and digital finance to the countryside, Finance and Economics Research, 46, 1, pp. 19-33, (2020); Hansen B.E., Threshold effects in non-dynamic panels: Estimation, testing, and inference, Journal of Econometrics, 93, 2, pp. 345-368, (1999); Graff M., Karmann A., What determines the finance-growth nexus?

It draws on the classical theory of banking and the literature on digital transformation. It provides an explanation for existing trends and, by extending the theory of the banking firm, it illustrates how financial intermediation will be impacted by innovative financial technology applications. It further reviews the options that established banks will have to consider in order to mitigate the threat to their profitability. Deposit taking and lending are considered in the context of the challenge made from shadow banking and the all-digital banks. The paper contributes to an understanding of the future of banking, providing a framework for scholarly empirical investigation. In the discussion, four possible strategies are proposed for market participants, (1) customer retention, (2) customer acquisition, (3) banking as a service and (4) social media payment platforms. It is concluded that, in an increasingly digital world, trust will remain at the core of banking. That said, liquidity transformation will still have an important role to play. The nature of banking and financial services, however, will change dramatically. © 2021, The Author(s).","Banking; Cryptocurrencies; Digital Payments; Fintech; Intermediation; P2P Lending","","","","","","","","Adrian T., Ashcraft A.B., Shadow banking: A review of the literature, Banking Crises, pp. 282-315, (2016); Allen F., The market for information and the origin of financial intermediation, J Financ Intermed, 1, 1, pp. 3-30, (1990); Anagnostopoulos I., Fintech and regtech: impact on regulators and banks, J Econ Bus, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Berger A.N., Herring R.J., Szego G.P., The role of capital in financial institutions, J Bank Finance, 19, 3-4, pp. 393-430, (1995); Berger A.N., Miller N.H., Petersen M.A., Rajan R.G., Stein J.C., Does function follow organizational form?

From the holistic spatial interaction perspective, this paper uses spatial simultaneous equations and generalized spatial three-stage least squares (GS3SLS) to analyze the spatial interaction spillovers between digital financial technology and urban ecological efficiency based on data from 284 Cities in China from 2008 to 2018. The results show that: (1) Digital financial technology and urban ecological efficiency promote each other, and the latter is relatively dominant. (2) Both digital financial technology and urban ecological efficiency have significant spatial spillover effects. (3) Digital financial technology in surrounding cities has a restraining effect on local ecological efficiency, and the improvement of ecological efficiency in surrounding cities has a siphon effect on local digital financial technology. (4) There is spatial and period heterogeneity in the intensity of the spatial interaction spillover effect between the two. With resources and environment increasingly becoming rigid constraints on economic growth, these findings help identify new drivers of regional ecological efficiency and promote the coordinated development of digital finance and green ecology. © 2021 by the authors.

This study is the first to propose an innovative extended approach based on the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) and Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IVIFS) models (IVIF-CoCoSo) to rank and evaluate sustainable fintech success factors in the Vietnamese fintech sector. Five success factors are collected from the existing literature to evaluate fintech firms. Using the IVIF-CoCoSo approach to rank, model, and evaluate the success factors (based on experts’ opinions) in a sustainable financial technology business, the results indicate that the agility, security, and innovative success factors are the most significant in the Vietnamese fintech sector. The study findings, and comparisons made between the results of the proposed method and other Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, confirm the accuracy of the proposed method in solving the fintech success factors evaluation problem. © 2022 The Author(s).

The fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) model is estimated for 23 European banks throughout the whole period ranging from 2010 to 2019 and for the two sub-periods spanning from 2010 to 2014 and from 2015 to 2019. The econometric results evince that fintech are positively and significantly related to the bank profitability, inferring that the greater the digital engagement of banks is, the higher the profitability is. Our findings provide evidence that the bank size is a moderator factor in affecting the relationship between digital investments and the profitability. Hence, larger banks benefit more from investments in the financial technology so as to improve their performance. Our study has substantial policy implications as we suggest that the increased investment in the fintech is a possible channel through which banks improve their performance, particularly when the bank size is considered large. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bank profitability; C12; C51; Chow test; Digital investment; Financial technologies; FMOLS model; G14; O33","","","","","","","","Abul Hasan M.S., Adler H.M., Bahtiar U., Determinants of bank profitability with size as moderating variable, Journal of Applied Finance & Banking, 10, pp. 1-7, (2020); Alkulaib Y.A., AlAli M.S., The estimation of banking industry staffing level benchmark: A case study on Kuwaiti banks, Accounting, 7, 1, pp. 95-98, (2020); Asongu S.A., Conditional determinants of mobile phones penetration and mobile banking in sub-Saharan Africa, The Journal of the Knowledge Economy, 9, 1, pp. 81-135, (2018); Bahri F., Hamza T., the impact of market power on bank risk-taking: An empirical investigation, The Journal of the Knowledge Economy, 11, 3, pp. 1198-1233, (2020); Baker M., Data collection–questionnaire design, The Marketing Review, 3, pp. 343-370, (2003); Barnewold L., Lottermoser B., Identification of digital technologies and digitalisation trends in the mining industry, International Journal of Mining Science and Technology., 30, 6, pp. 747-757, (2020); Brynjolfsson E., The productivity paradox of information technology, Communications of the ACM, 36, pp. 66-77, (1993); Campanella F., Della Peruta M.R., Del Giudice M., The effects of technological innovation on the banking sector, Journal of the Knowledge Economy, 8, pp. 356-368, (2017); Cenni S., Monferra S., Salottic V., Sangiorgid M., Torluccio G., Credit rationing and relationship lending.

Actively cooperating with financial technology companies has become an important channel for banks to cope with challenges and achieve transformational development. Assessing and selecting the best financial technology company is one of the core issues that banks should address in establishing cooperative relationships. In this paper, an integrated decision-making framework based on the best-worst method (BWM) and TODIM (an acronym for interactive and multi-criteria decision making in Portuguese) is proposed for financial technology selection under the interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) environment. Within the proposed framework, the preference information of decision-makers for alternatives and pairwise comparison among criteria is captured by the interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs), and the criteria weights are calculated by the IT2F-BWM method. Moreover, the IT2F-TODIM considering the psychological behavior state of decision-makers is introduced to determine the alternative ranking. The practicability and reliability of the proposed methodology are verified by a case study with sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis. This study contributes theoretically and practically to relevant literature by providing an effective framework capable of handling decision issues under uncertainty. © 2022, IAENG International Journal of Applied Mathematics.

Between 2010 and 2020, a quantitative and qualitative panel data set was used. The study population is represented by all the banks listed on the Amman stock exchange (n = 16). The study found that financial technology through its multitools changed the structure of the overall financial services, besides the diversity and style of financial services for the commercial banks' clients, thus reinforcing and increasing the availability for a wider social group that did not have access to that service. Further, it was found that there is a significant effect of the financial technology tools to reinforce the financial inclusion indicators over the studies' profitability indicators that include return on assets, return on equity, and earnings per share (JD). It is recommended to adopt effective and modern financial and technological strategies that provide marginalized social groups and small and medium enterprises reasonable access to the financial services and products that meet their needs, including transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance. Thus, getting the added value of the data and investing it to increase the financial inclusion indicators improves the profitability indicators and income for commercial banks. © Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan (ZUJ).","Commercial Banks; Financial Inclusion; Financial Technology; Profitability","","","","","","","","Abbasi T., Weigand H., The Impact of Digital Financial Services On Firm's Performance: A Literature Review, (2017); Al Chahadah A., El Refae G., Qasim A., The use of data mining techniques in accounting and finance as a corporate strategic tool: an empirical investigation on banks operating in emerging economies, International Journal of Economics and Business Research, 15, 4, pp. 442-452, (2018); Al-Dmour H., Nweiran M., Al-Dmour R., The Influence of Organizational Culture on E-Commerce Adoption, International Journal of Business and Management, 12, 9, (2017); Al-Chahadah A., El-Refae G, Qasim A., The impact of financial inclusion on bank performance: The case of Jordan, International Journal of Economics and Business Research, 20, 4, pp. 483-496, (2020); Ayoush M., Rabayah H, The Impact of Mergers on the Financial Performance of Jordanian Public Shareholding Compani.es, the Journal of Asian Finance, Economics and Business, 7, 10, pp. 751-759, (2020); Baber H., Impact of FinTech on customer retention in Islamic banks of Malaysia, International Journal of Business and Systems Research, 14, 2, pp. 217-227, (2020); Belouafi A., Fintech in the MENA Region: Current State and Prospects, Islamic FinTech, pp. 335-366, (2021); Cihak Martin, Mare Davide S., Melecky Martin, The Nexus of Financial Inclusion and Financial Stability: A Study of Trade-Offs and Synergies, (2016); Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Singer D., Ansar S., The Global Findex Database 2017: Measuring financial inclusion and the fintech revolution, (2018); Global FinTech Adoption Index, (2019); Kabiraj.

Machine learning is an important field of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. According to client knowledge gathered by machine learning, data structures may be more easily comprehended and changed. Machine learning, although still being employed in the IT business, has its own set of benefits. They are used by computer program to explain or solve a typical issue because they are a set of well-written instructions. Data inputs for factual research may be prepared by computers using master learning algorithms that can deliver results within a certain range. Computers are used to model test data, and frameworks are used to make automated decisions based on input data. Banks and financial institutions may benefit from the use of machine learning.

The principal component analysis was used to generate an index for Fintech. The results showed that aside from finding a consistent conclusion with previous studies that both internal and external factors drive bank liquidity, and it also confirmed the existence of a U-shaped relationship between bank liquidity and Fintech adoption. Furthermore, this suggested that BRICS banks face a dampening effect of Fintech on their liquidity risk to a certain threshold after which further adoption will significantly raise liquidity risk. The sufficient condition of the U-test also revealed a consistent conclusion. The present study recommends the optimization of the right Fintech adoption, and the improvement of the internal management of banks among the BRICS market to mitigate liquidity risk. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bank-specific factors; BRICS economies; Financial technology; Liquidity risk; Macroeconomic factors","","","","","","","","Al-Homaidi E.A., Tabash M.I., Farhan N.H., Almaqtari F.A., The determinants of liquidity of Indian listed commercial banks: A panel data approach, Cogent Econ.

Their combination represents the financial technology sector (FinTech). It has been substantiated that FinTech is a direction of the IT industry, which is engaged in development, security of digital transaction technologies and creation of mobile applications that facilitate transactions. It is obvious that the FinTech sector began to develop in Europe much earlier than in Russia. At the moment, the FinTech sector has significantly expanded beyond the boundaries of mobile payments and transfers. The most widely used financial technologies include P2P lending, T-commerce, E-wallets, mPOS acquiring, M-wallets, Bitcoin and others. Moreover, many clients of financial institutions are unwittingly already using most of the above technologies, and in some cases, without realizing the technical component of this financial product. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Digital transactions; Financial technology sector; FinTech industry","","","","","","","","Mishchenko S., Naumenkova S., Mishchenko V., Dorofeiev D., Innovation risk management in financial institutions, Investment Manage.

This study aims to find the channels through which Fintech affects enterprise innovation in China from the perspective of financial management. Design/Methodology/Approach – This study constructs an econometric model using the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2011 to 2019 to examine the influence of Fintech development on enterprise innovation and its transmission mechanism. Findings – The empirical results show that the development of Fintech does indeed have a driving effect on enterprise innovation. Fintech promotes enterprise innovation by alleviating financial constraints, reducing the enterprise financial expense rate, and increasing the stability of the enterprise against the backdrop of the high-quality development of China’s economy. Research Implications – This study implies that actively promoting the development of the Fintech industry can promote the innovative development of enterprises; thus, policy and technical support are indispensable for promoting the development of Fintech. Also, the government should improve the regulatory system of Fintech to prevent financial risk. © 2022 International Academy of Global Business and Trade.

Even though the transaction value for financial technology in 2018 grew by 24%, the financial inclusion rate in Indonesia is still low, with 64% unbanked. The aim of the study was to analyze the factors of the growing digital technology that influence customer decisions in choosing financial technology services using customer knowledge as the intervening variable. The growing digital technology is measured using social networking, regulatory services, and financial service facilities variables. The sample of this research focused on the microsegment customers located in Java Island. Statistical data are analyzed using Algorithm PLS. Results show that customer decision in choosing financial technology services was strongly influenced by customer knowledge. Customer knowledge was formed from information gathered from the social network, the formal assurance by the government, the financial service facilities, and financial inclusivity. The study recommends a need to educate, promote, and provide adequate information to increase familiarity and literacy rate with regard to financial technology. The study also recommends an urgent clear government regulation to protect the interests of customers and industries. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Customer Decision; Customer Knowledge; Financial Inclusivity; Financial Service Facilities; Regulatory Services; Social Networking","","","","","","","","Global FinTech investment growth continues in 2016 driven by Europe and Asia, (2016); Aisenberg F.H., Durst S., Hesamamiri R., The impact of social media on knowledge management, 11th In-ternational Forum on Knowledge Asset Dynamics (IFKAD)-Dresden, (2016); Anothai N., Beise-Zee R., Customer preference for decision authority in credence services: The moderating ef-fects of source credibility and persuasion knowledge, Managing Service Quality, 24, 3, pp. 274-299, (2014); Ekonomi digital dan kebijakan moneter pemerintah, (2017); Analisa perkembangan finansial dan perbankan di Indonesia di tahun 2018, (2018); Blohm I., Leimeister J.

Financial inclusion of MSMEs is essential for any country aspiring to economic development. Innovative solutions offered by fintech companies can support the financial inclusion of MSMEs. Digital payments, alternative loans, insurance, investments, regulatory, and robo-advisory services are just a few of the services that fintech companies provide to MSMEs. The purpose of this study-is to examine the role of financial technology on registered micro, small, and medium enterprises in India. The objective of the study is to reveal the behaviour of MSMEs towards financial technology acceptance and show how various demographic variables of owners/managers influence the acceptance of financial technology in the case of MSMEs.. The methodological basis of the study is a management survey of 117 MSMEs in India. The questionnaire had 25 questions; measurement items used in the questionnaire were derived from previous studies carried out in developing countries. The results were processed and tested for significance using modern econometric methods such as the Kruskal-Wallis H test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. The result of the study indicates that the financial technology acceptance rate among the MSME sector is high as maximum MSMEs consider themselves moderate financial technology adopters. MSMEs have a high understanding of different financial services provided by fintech companies. Prior Experience of the owner/ manager, brand familiarity, government support, and behavioural variables such as perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, and satisfaction was proved to be effective while adopting financial technology services whereas, demographic variables such as gender, age, education level of owner/manager was found to be ineffective. The study concludes that fintech companies are providing quality services by acting as a single window, supporting the financial needs of MSMEs at low interest rates, simplified processes and lower transaction costs. MSMEs are using fintech products and services as a key part of their financial management, with increasing adoption there is a growing opportunity for fintech companies, incumbents, and non-financial organisations. The result of the study contributes to the novel understanding of the acceptance and preference of the MSME sector towards financial technology. © Gupta U., Agarwal B., Nautiyal N., 2022.","behavioural factors; financial management by small businesses; financial technology; financial technology adoption; fintech companies; fintech products; Indian MSMEs","","","","","","","","Muthukannan P., Tan B., Gozman D., Johnson L., The emergence of a fintech ecosystem: A case study of the Vizag Fintech Valley in India, Information & Management, 57, 8, (2020); Carney M., Enable, empower, ensure: A new finance for the new economy, Speech at the Mansion House, (2019); Schueffel P., Taming the beast: A scientific definition of fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, 4, 4, pp. 32-54, (2016); Cassar G., The financing of business start-ups, Journal of Business Venturing, 19, 2, pp. 261-283, (2004); Capelleras J.-L., Contin-Pilart I., Larraza-Kintana M., Martin-Sanchez V., Entrepreneurs’ human capital and growth aspirations: The moderating role of regional entrepreneurial culture, Small Business Economics, 52, 1, pp. 3-25, (2019); Irwin D., Scott J.M., Barriers faced by SMEs in raising bank finance, International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior & Research, 16, 3, pp. 245-259, (2010); Rosavina M., Rahadi R.A., Kitri M.L., Nuraeni S., Mayangsari L., P2P lending adoption by SMEs in Indonesia, Qualitative Research in Financial Markets, 11, 2, pp. 260-279, (2019); Sarmah A., Saikia B., Tripathi D., Can unemployment be answered by micro small and medium enterprises?

Because of the development in the field of financial technology with the various solutions offered, this study aims to examine the role of financial technology for the development of MSMEs (Micro and Medium Enterprises), this research also includes aspects of the role of financial inclusion for the development of MSMEs to be able to see how much public knowledge is about financial service products and risk knowledge. The case study in this research is MSMEs in the Tangerang area using quantitative methods. The results of research using multiple linear regression analysis found that the role of financial financial technology for the development of MSMEs has a significant positive effect. Meanwhile, financial inclusion for the development of MSMEs has a positive and insignificant effect on the dependent variable. This study concludes that the use of financial technology for MSME businesses, as well as the high reference to financial products, are important factors in encouraging the development of MSMEs.  © 2021 ACM.","Development; Financial Inclusion; Financial Technology; MSMEs; Role","Finance; Development; Financial inclusions; Financial problems; Financial service; Indonesia; Micro-enterprises; MSME; Role; Small-and-medium enterprise; Technology innovation; Linear regression","","","","","","","AFTECH Annual Report, (2017); Rahardjo B., Khairul I., Siharis A.K., THE EFFECT of FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (Financial Technology) on the DEVELOPMENT of MSMES in MAGELANG CITY, (2019); Sugiarti E.N., Diana N.M.C.M., THE ROLE of financial technology in IMPROVING FINANCIAL LITERATURE in SMALL MEDIUM MICRO BUSINESS in MALANG, Scientific Journal of Accounting Research, (2019); Husnil Khatimah F.H., Consumers' intention to use e-money in Indonesia based on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), American-Eurasian Journal of Sustainable Agriculture, pp. 34-40, (2014); Financial Stability Implications from Fintech, (2017); Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) Database, (2011); Marini L., Putra R.E., The Role of Fintech on Financial Inclusion in South Tangerang MSMEs, Sustainability : Journal of Management and Journal of Accounting, 5, 2, pp. 91-104, (2020); Financial Inclusive Booklet, (2016); Pariyem P., Widiyanto W., Sakitri W., Variabel Determinant Development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in Srondol Market, Economic Education Analysis Journal, 9, 1, pp. 316-331, (2020); Wulansari N., Kurniawan Y., ACCELERATION of ECONOMIC GROWTH THROUGH SYNERGY of MSMES and GOOD GOVERNANCE in Indonesia, Prosiding Seminar Nasional Dan Call for Paper Ekonomi Dan Bisnis, (2018); Wardani A.P.Y.K., Darmawan N.A.S., The Role of Financial Technology in MSMEs: Improving Financial Literacy Based on Payment Gateway, Scientific Journal of Accounting and Humanities, 10, 2, pp. 170-175, (2020); Adriani D., Wiksuana I.G.B., Financial Inclusion in Relation to the Growth of MSMEs and the Level of Community Welfare in the Province of Bali, E-Jurnal Manajemen, 7, 12, pp. 6420-6444, (2018); Septiani R.N., Wuryani E., THE EFFECT of FINANCIAL LITERATURE and FINANCIAL INCLUSION on MSME PERFORMANCE in SIDOARJO, E-Jurnal Manajemen, 9, 8, pp. 3214-3236; Wirjo W.W., Empowerment of Microfinance Institutions as One of the Pillars of the National Financial System: Concrete Efforts to Break the Poverty Chain, Journal of Economic and Financial Studies, (2005); Dermawan T., The Effect of Literacy, Inclusion and Financial Management on the Performance and Sustainability of MSMEs (Study on Micro BusinessActors, Brawijaya University Students), (2019); Yadiati W., Nissa, Paulus S., Suharman H., Meiryani, The Role of Green Intellectual Capital and Organizational Reputation in Influencing Environmental Performance, International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy, 9, 3, pp. 261-268, (2019); Susanto A., Meiryani, How user ability and top management support influence on accounting information system quality and its impact on the quality of accounting information, Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences, 13, 16, pp. 6645-6652, (2018); Meiryani S.P., Puspokusurno R.A., Lusianah A.W., Decision Making and Management Information Systems, Journal of Critical Reviews, 7, 7, pp. 320-325, (2020)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Beijing Jiaotong University","11th International Conference on Communication and Network Security, ICCNS 2021","3 December 2021 through 5 December 2021","Virtual, Online","177542","","978-145038642-5","","","English","ACM Int.

As it is becoming obvious, opening operational and functional banking business offices in many developing countries is not a financially viable option. Banking offices need an enormous amount of resources, equipment, and personnel to run efficiently. In most developing countries where low income is the norm rather than the exceptions, it is not possible to sustain a policy objective that employs the use of banking offices to address the problem of financial inclusion. Such initiative could start out well; however, the possibility of sustainability is called into question. Thus, whatever meaningful gains have been garnered from such policy will be reversed or lost over time. To address the financial inclusion problem, financial technology offers the instrument, tools, and mechanism to drive financial inclusion in ways traditional methods of banking cannot. Financial technology offers cost-effective and cheaper means of driving financial development. This chapter suggests that financial technology should be used as a means of driving financial development in developing countries as it offers a more sustainable and cost-effective solution to the problem of financial inclusion. Developing countries should embrace, adopt, and adapt financial technologies to address their financial development issues. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Constructing an evaluation model that can accurately measure the credit quality of commercial banks and then systematically analyze the distribution and evolution of credit quality is of great significance for judging the operating situation and pattern of credit assets of commercial banks in our country. This paper analyzes the credit asset quality of our country's commercial banks from five aspects: credit asset scale, profitability, risk security, liquidity, and expansion capability, and uses computer extensive data analysis and structural equation model to analyze the 20 representative banks in our country. An empirical analysis is conducted in a commercial bank.  © 2022 Zeyi Yu.","","Quality control; Risk assessment; Bank credit; Commercial bank; Credit quality; Credit Structures; Evaluation models; Model-based OPC; Operating efficiency; Primary sources; Structure models; Technology innovation; Big data","","","","","","","Liang X., Research on supply chain finance and risk, Beijing: University of Economics and Business, 22, pp. 120-138, (2020); Li Q.Q., Chen S.Q., Application of two-stage network super-efficiency DEA to efficiency analysis of Chinese commercial banks, Journal of Mathematics, 2022, (2022); Wang Y.M., Research on commercial bank risk early warning model based on dynamic parameter optimization neural network, Journal of Mathematics, 2022, (2022); Liu L.L., A self-learning BP neural network assessment algorithm for credit risk of commercial bank, WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING 2022, 2022, (2022); Shi X., Yu W.Q., Analysis of Chinese commercial banks' risk management efficiency based on the PCA-DEA approach, MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING 2021, 2021, (2021); Zhang Y., Research on credit risk management of agricultural supply chain finance, Harbin: Harbin Engineering University, 12, pp. 225-228, (2021); Deng X.H., Li K.T., Liu H.W., A novel consensus algorithm based on segmented DAG and BP neural network for consortium blockchain, SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS 2022, 2022, (2022); Liang Y., Zhang W., Adaptive model of discrete real-time linear dynamic logic for the optimization of big data game education mode, SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING 2022, 2022, (2022); Li L., Mao C., Sun H., Yuan Y., Lei B., Digital twin driven green performance evaluation methodology of intelligent manufacturing: hybrid model based on fuzzy rough-sets AHP, multistage weight synthesis, and PROMETHEE II, Complexity, 2020, 6, pp. 1-24, (2020); Tian J.J., Li L., Digital universal financial credit risk analysis using particle swarm optimization algorithm with structure decision tree learning-based evaluation model, WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING 2022, 2022, (2022); Wang L.N., Song H., E-commerce credit risk assessment based on fuzzy neural network, Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2022, (2022); Qian F., Cao C., Pu X., Analysis of the financing game of agricultural cooperative economic organizations based on supply chain finance, 7, pp. 65-67, (2021); Li Y.Y., Lu J., Cao K.X., Study on risk analysis and decision-making of small-and medium-sized enterprises on BP neural network algorithm, SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING 2022, 2022, (2022); Sharifi P., Jain V., Aghapour V., Banks credit risk prediction with optimized ANN based on improved owl search algorithm, MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING 2021, 2021, (2021); Li L., Lei B., Mao C., Digital twin in smart manufacturing, Journal of Industrial Information Integration.

The specific objectives of this study are to gauge the financial knowledge of young professionals and analyze their attitudes and behavior in regards to the use of Fintech for basic money management, financial planning and investment decisions. The study also aims to analyze the extent to which Fintech is used and its impact on financial literacy levels. The research methodology employs a dual approach. A quantitative study using a survey targets young professionals in the different occupational groups that constitute the Mauritian professional workforce. A regression model is developed to investigate the impact of Fintech usage and demographic factors on financial literacy. The findings reveal significant differences in financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviors attributable to various demographic factors. Furthermore, Fintech usage is limited to the traditional offerings while more innovative Fintech has relatively lower adoption rates. The study has uncovered the positive impact of Fintech usage on financial literacy, opening avenues for rethinking the content and scope of traditional financial education programs. © 2021 Conscientia Beam.

Using an exploratory study, the researchers developed an interactive and interpretive model that analyses the most critical variables to consider when designing the next level of financial robo-advisor through integrating digital twin concepts and applications. Primarily, it conducts an assessment and then reviews the data to propose a model that can serve as a baseline for future research. Related literature was explored, including peer-reviewed journal articles, case studies, periodicals, newspaper articles, and books. This study aims to assess the concept of digital twin (DT) as the next frontier of robo-advisor as a new wave of intelligent financial advisors in supporting the personalisation and customisation of financial technology (FinTech) services and management. Individuals who use a DT-enabled robo-advisor may find a significantly greater value for their financial management and well-being. A robo-advisor with DT enabled will no longer be an ad hoc financial advisory service but will evolve into a comprehensive and dynamic financial advisory service for users. The research presents several critical insights on financial robo-advisory with DT capabilities, transforming and optimising smart financial advisory. © 2022 by the authors.

Prof. Stanisława Łojasiewicza 4, Kraków, 30-348, Poland","PURPOSE: The traditional sources of financing (bank loans) cannot be treated as an essential source of financing for SMEs in developing countries. For this reason, this group of entities uses many alternative sources, from bootstrapping to microfinance and crowdfunding. During the last decade, a significant contribution in this area has been done by financial technology. The purpose of this study is threefold: 1) to present the role of financial technologies in financing SMEs, 2) to examine the role of entities based on financial technology in financing SMEs in developing countries, and 3) to consider other non-bank aspects of financing SMEs, leading to the improvement of the financial situation of these entities. The in-depth analysis of these entrepreneurial finance practices will be developed in the following papers presented in this Issue. METHODOLOGY: This study employs a theoretical approach based on a narrative literature review. The primary attention is focused on applying financial technology as a stimulant for the finance of SMEs in developing countries. FINDINGS: As a consequence of the financing gap for SMEs within the traditional financial system, these entities use non-bank financing based on financial technology. The research confirms that financial technology plays a crucial role in fostering the financial situation of SMEs in developing countries and providing greater financial inclusion for these entities. Both, financial technology and enterprises based on this technology contribute significantly to the improvement of efficiency of financing SMEs in emerging markets. They also provide a broader range of services, than were offered by the traditional financial sector. Regarding the other aspects of SME finance, it is essential to implement such ways of financing like microfinance services and crowdfunding. Such funding mechanisms, together with the budget process and the compliance under the conditions of e-tax systems, are important determinants of current entrepreneurial finance. IMPLICATIONS: The paper describes the financing of SMEs in developing countries. The in-depth picture of the SME’s financial situation, focusing on the technological development in this area, provides essential insight into this still poorly explored area. It also offers important premises for shaping the post-pandemic policy to support their further growth. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Despite growing theoretical and empirical literature about entrepreneurial finance, this study aims to contribute to the role of financial technology in this area. The impact of financial technologies and the role of fintech-based entities on SME activity in developing countries are still poorly researched. Moreover, the research provides a brief overview of other SME funding sources and their determinants in this group of countries. © 2022, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

Bank Indonesia (2017) states that financial technology can be categorized into five categories, namely: 1) payment system, 2) market support, 3) investment management and risk management, 4) loans, financing, and capital provision, and 5) other financial services. This research is quantitative with the type of survey research. The data source used is primary data obtained through an online questionnaire. The sample used was 385 respondents who were in the Jabodetabek, Indonesia, aged 18–45 years and had been using an e-wallet for at least 1 year with a sampling technique namely purposive sampling. The analytical method used is partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS software version 3.2.9. The results of this study conclude that ease of use, security, economic benefits, and financial ability simultaneously have a positive and significant influence on continuance usage intention of financial technology payment in Jabodetabek Indonesia. This shows that the easier it is to use, the more secure it is to use, economic benefits and financial ability will increase the consumer behavior on continuance usage intention of financial technology payment. © 2022 The Authors.","Continuance Usage Intention; Ease of Use; Economic Benefits; Financial Ability; Financial Technology; Indonesia; Security","","","","","","","","Indonesian Fintech, (2020); Alif M.

Using a logit regression over a total sample of 298 survey respondents in Indonesia, the empirical results show that customers with access to bank loans, financial technology awareness, and trust of regulators are those who are most likely to borrow from peer-to-peer lending platforms. Given the rapid growth of the industry and regulatory trust is associated with applying for loans, regulators should consider licensing or registering peer-to-peer lending platforms on a regular basis. © 2021 Chulalognkorn University.

Blockchain, as the underlying technology of Bitcoin's digital monetary system, is currently sweeping the globe. Blockchain is a revolutionary decentralized database technology that employs encryption, a timestamp chain data structure, a distributed consensus mechanism, and other technologies to achieve decentralization, tamper resistance, easy tracking, and programmable smart contracts. In the face of rising financial technology, we must maintain inclusive, technological, and invasive regulatory principles that not only foster financial innovation, but also conduct dynamic supervision to avoid systemic financial hazards. The consensus algorithm is one of the main blockchain technologies that has a direct impact on the system's functioning. As a result, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based development and supervision method for financial technology, as well as an application of this technology to commercial settlement, which can significantly reduce data complexity, time consumption, and the structural chain phenomenon in existing transaction settlement. We bring the idea of pow competition into DPoS, construct a consensus algorithm with an upgrade mechanism, and call it delegated proof of work, based on an in-depth investigation of the working principle of pow (proof of work) (dDPoS). The blocking efficiency of the dDPoS consensus method is around one block every 10 seconds, which is significantly higher than the blocking efficiency of the POW and POS consensus algorithms. As a result, it offers a potential answer to traditional centralized institutions' concerns of high brokerage costs and insecure central storage, as well as a wide range of application possibilities.  © 2022 Rui Yang.","","Cryptography; Digital storage; Efficiency; Finance; Block-chain; Blockings; Consensus algorithms; Database technology; Decentralisation; Decentralized database; Monetary system; Proof of work; Technology-based; Time-stamp; algorithm; article; blockchain; competition; consensus; Blockchain","","","","","","","Li J., Chen Y., Song H., Research on digital currency supervision model based on blockchain technology, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1744, 3, (2021); Zhao Z., Yao S.K.C.F., Zhao W., Li J., Luhrs M., Goebel R., Kendrick K.M., Real-time functional connectivity-informed n of amygdala-frontal pathways reduces anxiety, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 88, 1, pp. 5-15, (2019); Xiang J., Research on the problems and governance of live E-commerce based on blockchain technology, Business and Economic Research, 4, 2, (2021); Zhao W., Blockchain technology:development and prospects, National Science Review, 6, 2, pp. 193-197, (2019); Ding Y., Zhao X., Zhang Z., Cai W., Yang N., Zhan Y., Semi-supervised locality preserving dense graph neural network with ARMA filters and context-aware learning for hyperspectral image classification, IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 60, (2021); Meunier S., Blockchain 101: What is blockchain and how does this revolutionary technology work?

Being one form of FinTech financing, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has been widely developed and has grown rapidly for the last few years. The main challenge for P2P lending is on managing risks. FinTech with artificial intelligence (AI) can be used as a strategic tool in mitigating risks for FinTech companies in assessing creditworthiness of a potential customer. However, AI-enabled assessment has created several ethical issues and dilemmas for the stakeholders in the industry. This paper aims to examine the ethical issues and dilemmas by deploying theories of consequentialism and deontology in assisting an ethical decision-making process. An AI-enabled risk assessment will automate processes in understanding potential applicants for P2P lending. The automation process can potentially mitigate any ethical shortcomings as well as the negative impacts in mining the potential customer’s data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Business ethics; Financial technology; P2P lending","","","","","","","","Ahad A.D., Anshari M., Razzaq A., Domestication of smartphones among adolescents in Brunei darussalam, International Journal of Cyber Behavior, Psychology and Learning (IJCBPL), 7, 4, pp. 26-39, (2017); Anshari M., Almunawar M.N., Masri M., Hamdan M., Digital marketplace and FinTech to support agriculture sustainability, Energy Procedia, 156, pp. 234-238, (2019); Anshari M., (2020); Anshari M., Arine M.A., Nurhidayah N., Aziyah H., Salleh M.H.A., Factors influencing individual in adopting eWallet, Journal of Financial Services Marketing, 26, 1, pp. 10-23, (2021); Arnold D.G., Beauchamp T.L., Bowie N.L., Ethical theory and business, (2012); Bella F.I., Optimization of Islamic Peer-to-Peer Lending for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) After Pandemic of Covid-19, Journal of Islamic Economic Laws, 3, 2, pp. 108-123, (2020); Bughin J., Hazan E., Ramaswamy S., Chui M., Allas T., Dahlstrom P., Artificial intelligence - The next digital frontier, (2017); Cooper D.R., Schindler P.S., Sun J., Business research methods, pp. 1-744, (2006); Finn R.L., Wright D., Unmanned aircraft systems: Surveillance, ethics and privacy in civil applications, Computer Law & Security Review, 28, 2, pp. 184-194, (2012); Gan D., Comparative Analysis of Peer-to-Peer Lending in China and the United Kingdom: An Assessment of the Lending Plaza's Market Entry Prospects, (2017); Garret T., Business ethics, (1970); Guo H., Polak P., Artificial Intelligence and Financial Technology Fintech: How AI is Being Used under the Pandemic in 2020, pp. 169-186, (2021); Jalil M., Azam F., Rahman M.K., Implementation Mechanism of ethics in Business organizations, International Business Research, 3, 4, pp. 145-155, (2010); Kafer B., Peer-to-Peer lending–a (financial stability) risk perspective, Review of Economics, 69, 1, pp. 1-25, (2018); la Follette H., (2002); Mateescu A., Peer-to-Peer lending, Data & Society Research Institute, (2015); Newman M.J., Image and identity: Media literacy for young adult Instagram users, Visual Inquiry, 4, 3, pp. 221-227, (2015); Polak P., Nelischer C., Guo H., Et al., Intelligent” finance and treasury management: what we can expect, AI & Soc, 35, pp. 715-726, (2020); Stodder G.S., Goodwill Hunting.

Fintech in Indonesia has high potential, where fintech is dominated by the payment sector by 38%, lending by 31%, personal finance and wealth management by 8%, and the rest is filled by other sectors. The use of fintech has attracted a lot of attention, but the continued use of fintech remains in doubt. Some users are hesitant to continue using fintech because it has considerable risks. The risks borne by fintech users start from entering personal data into the information system so that users can use the facilities in the application used. Thus allowing misuse of information provided by users. This research aims to measure the information security awareness of students as fintech users in Indonesia. The study was conducted on 400 students in Indonesia who use fintech and uses the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) by developing dimensions of attitude, knowledge, and behavior to measure a person's information security awareness. The results showed that the total level of information security awareness was 88% and was in the good category. However, there is one focus area in the moderate category with the lowest level of 73%, namely adoption of security control so that students as users of fintech services should use different passwords/pins on some of their fintech account in order to avoid the risk of leakage of user data.  © 2022 IEEE.","Awareness; Fintech Users; Information Security; Student","Finance; Security of data; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Awareness; Continued use; Finance management; Fintech user; High potential; Indonesia; Information security awareness; Measurements of; Wealth management; Students","","","","","","","Databoks.katadata.co.id, Pengguna Internet Indonesia Peringkat ke-3 Terbanyak di Asia, (2021); Laporan Survei Internet APJII 2019-2020, (2020); Irawan D., Affan M.W., Pengaruh Privasi Dan Keamanan Terhadap Niat Menggunakan Payment Fintech, Journal Kajian Akuntansi, 4, 1, pp. 52-62, (2020); Nurdin N., Azizah W.N., Rusli R., Pengaruh Pengetahuan,Kemudahan dan Risiko Terhadap Minat Bertransaksi Menggunakan Finansial Technology (Fintech) Pada Mahasiswa Institut Agama Islam Negeri (IAIN) Palu, Journal Perbankan Dan Keuangan Syariah, 2, 2, (2020); Survei: 44 Persen Orang Gunakan E-Wallet 4 Kali Sepekan, (2021); Kruger H.A., Kearney W.D., A prototype for assessing information security awareness, Computer & Security, 25, pp. 289-329, (2006); Kumala I., Mutia I., Pemanfaatan Aplikasi Dompet Digital Terhadap Transaksi Retail Mahasiswa, Seminar Nasional Riset Dan Teknologi, pp. 64-69, (2020); Marranitha I.D.A.R.P., Suardana I.B.R., Pengaruh Kepercayaan, Selisih Bunga Kredit Dengan Bank Konvensional, Dan Kemudahan Proses Kredit Terhadap MinatMahasiswa Dalam Menggunakan Layanan Fintech Berbasis Pinjaman Online: Studi Kasus di PTN dan PTS Provinsi Bali, TIERS Information Technology Journal, 1, 2, pp. 44-50, (2020); Girsang M.J., Candiwan Hendayani R., Ganesan Y., Can Information Security, Privacy, and Satisfaction Influence the E-Commerce Consumer Trust?, 2020 8th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT, (2020); Ryu H., Industrial Management & Data Systems Article information : What makes users willing or hesitant to use Fintech ?: The moderating effect of user type, Industrial Management & Data Systems, 118, 3, pp. 541-569, (2018); Nurkholis O., Fitroh, Rustamaji E., Usulan Keamanan Sistem Informasi pada Penyelenggara Financial Technology (Fintech) Menggunakan Cobit 5 (Studi Kasus: Gandengtangan.org), Applied Information Systems and Management (AISM, 2, 2, pp. 57-60, (2019); Stewart H., Jrjens J., Data security and consumer trust in FinTech innovation in Germany, Information and Computer Security, 26, 1, pp. 109-128, (2018); Reimon B.J., Kariso B., Moningkey M., Tumembow A., Tingkat Kesadaran Privasi Atas Masalah Keamanan Informasi ( Lack of Security Awareness, (2018); Marak Serangan Siber, Fintech Makin Butuh UU Perlindungan Data-Fintech, (2020); Korban Pinjaman Online di Indonesia Gugat OJK Karena Data Pribadi Disebarkan-ABC, (2018); Bosamia M., Patel D., Wallet Payments Recent Potential Threats and Vulnerabilities with its possible security Measures, International Journal of Computer Sciences and Engineering, 7, 1, pp. 810-817, (2019); Ramadhani A., KEAMANAN INFORMASI, JILS Journal of Information and Library Studies, 1, 1, (2018); Basyarahil F.A., Astuti H.M., Hidayanto B.C., Evaluasi Manajemen Keamanan Informasi Menggunakan Indeks Keamanan Informasi (KAMI) Berdasarkan ISO/IEC 27001:2013 pada Direktorat Pengembangan Teknologi dan Sistem Informasi (DPTSI) ITS Surabaya, JOURNAL TEKNIK ITS, 6, (2017); Santoso J.D., ANALISIS PASSWORD CRACKCING MNEGGUNAKAN GPU PROCESS, 3, (2019); Akraman R., Candiwan C., Priyadi Y., Pengukuran Kesadaran Keamanan Informasi Dan Privasi Pada Pengguna Smartphone Android di Indonesia, JOURNAL SISTEM INFORMASI BISNIS, 8, 2, (2018); Alif M.S., Pratama A.R., Analisis Kesadaran Keamanan di Kalangan Pengguna E-Wallet di Indonesia, AUTOMATA, (2020); Koyuncu M., Pusatli T., Security Awareness Level of Smartphone Users: An Exploratory Case Study, Mobile Information Systems, 2019, (2019)","N.

The present research conceptualizes Kahn’s employee engagement theory and employs transformational leadership, ethical leadership, and participative leadership as its antecedents to predict counterproductive work behaviors through a latent growth model. The present research collected empirical data of 505 employees of fintech businesses in Great China at three waves over 6 months. The findings revealed that as employees perceived higher transformational leadership, ethical leadership, and participative leadership at the first time point, they may demonstrate more positive growths in employee engagement development behavior, which in turn, caused more negative growths in counterproductive work behaviors. The present research stresses a dynamic model of the three leaderships that can alleviate counterproductive work behaviors through the mediating role of employee engagement over time. © Copyright © 2021 Huang, Li and Chang.","counterproductive work behaviors; employee engagement; ethical leadership; participative leadership; transformational leadership","","","","","","","","Arnold J.A., Arad S., Rhoades J.A., Drasgow F., The empowering leadership questionnaire: the construction and validation of a new scale for measuring leader behaviors, J.

First, 848 publications were obtained from Web of Science. Their fundamental characteristics were analyzed, including the types, annual publications, hot research directions, and foci (by theme analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and timeline analysis of author keywords). Next, the prolific objects (at the level of countries/regions, institutions, journals, and authors) and corresponding pivotal cooperative relationship networks were used to highlight who pays attention to FinTech. Furthermore, the citation structures of authors and journals were investigated, including citation and co-citation. Additionally, this paper presents the burst detection analysis of cited authors, journals, and references. Finally, combining the analysis results with the current financial environment, the challenges and future development opportunities are discussed further. Accordingly, a comprehensive study of the FinTech documents not only reviews the current research characteristics and trajectories but also helps scholars find the appropriate research entry point and conduct in-depth research. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bibliometric analysis; Citation structure; Development trends; FinTech; Visualization networks","","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71771155)","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71771155.

At present, the financial industry provides customers with a variety of investment services, but it has always been unable to provide targeted services for customers. Based on this, this paper studies the optimization of intelligent financial technology core technology based on collaborative filtering algorithm in the big data environment. On the basis of a simple analysis of the application of financial core technology and the research status of collaborative filtering algorithm, this paper constructs an application model of intelligent financial collaborative filtering algorithm. In view of the shortcomings of collaborative filtering algorithm, it uses user-based clustering algorithm to improve the collaborative filtering algorithm. According to the frequency of customers' access to financial products, the attention model is established and simulated. The results show that the collaborative filtering optimization algorithm used in this paper can reduce the absolute error of recommendation and improve the accuracy.  © 2022 Xiaohua Hou.","","Clustering algorithms; Collaborative filtering; Finance; Sales; Signal filtering and prediction; Collaborative filtering algorithms; Core technology; Data environment; Economic level; Financial industry; Financial investments; Optimisations; Simple analysis; Technology optimization; Technology-based; Big data","","","","","","","Liu X., An improved clustering-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, Cluster Computing, 20, 2, pp. 1281-1288, (2017); Bunnell L., Osei-Bryson K.M., Yoon V.Y., Development of a consumer financial goals ontology for use with FinTech applications for improving financial capability, Expert Systems with Applications, 165, 3, (2020); Zhao T.R., Models for evaluating the benefit risk and performance of Internet financial product with triangular fuzzy information, Journal of Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems, 37, 2, pp. 1819-1826, (2019); Cheng X., Feng L., Gui Q., Collaborative filtering algorithm based on data mixing and filtering, International Journal of Performability Engineering, 15, 8, (2019); Shang H., Lu D., Zhou Q., Early warning of enterprise finance risk of big data mining in Internet of Things based on fuzzy association rules, Neural Computing and Applications, 33, 9, pp. 3901-3909, (2021); Moro S., Cortez P., Rita P., A divide-and-conquer strategy using feature relevance and expert knowledge for enhancing a data mining approach to bank telemarketing, Expert Systems, 35, 3, (2018); Tang W.M., Yiu K., Chan K.Y., Wong H., Fuzzy system with customized subset selection for financial trading applications, International Journal of Fuzzy Systems, 21, 8, pp. 2435-2447, (2019); Yu X., Jiang F., Du J., Gong D., A cross-domain collaborative filtering algorithm with expanding user and item features via the latent factor space of auxiliary domains, Pattern Recognition, 94, pp. 96-109, (2019); Pan T.T., Wen F., Liu Q.R., Collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on rating matrix filling and item predictability, Zidonghua Xuebao/Acta Automatica Sinica, 43, 9, pp. 1597-1606, (2017); Li J., Zhang K., Yang X., Wei P., Wang J., Mitra K., Ranjan R., Category preferred canopy-K-means based collaborative filtering algorithm, Future Generation Computer Systems, 93, pp. 1046-1054, (2019); Ye S., Application of collaborative filtering algorithm in the design of library recommendation system in university library, Revista de la Facultad de Ingenieria, 32, 14, pp. 348-353, (2017); Luo G., Ouyang W., A method of forest-fire image recognition based on collaborative filtering algorithm, Boletin Tecnico/technical Bulletin, 55, 9, pp. 14-19, (2017); Xiao-Long C., Bo D., Guo-Ping S., Yan Y., Multi-collaborative filtering algorithm for accurate push of command information system, Revista de la Facultad de Ingenieria, 32, 7, pp. 165-172, (2017); Cai W., Pan W., Liu J., Chen Z., Ming Z., K-Reciprocal nearest neighbors algorithm for one-class collaborative filtering, Neurocomputing, 381, pp. 207-216, (2020); Liu X., A collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on the influence sets of e-learning group's behavior, Cluster Computing, 22, 5, pp. 1-11, (2017); Qian X., Liu G., Restricted Boltzmann machine collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on project tag improvement, International Journal of Performability Engineering, 14, 6, pp. 1109-1118, (2018); Jiang B., Yang J., Qin Y., Wang T., Wang M., Pan W., A service recommendation algorithm based on knowledge graph and collaborative filtering, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 50880-50892, (2021); Li X., Li D., An improved collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm and recommendation strategy, Mobile Information Systems, 2019, 13, (2019); Mu R., Zeng X., Collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on knowledge graph, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2018, 4, (2018); Zhang Y., Wang Y., Wang S., Improvement of collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on intuitionistic fuzzy reasoning under missing data, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 51324-51332, (2020); Han J., Cheng H., Shi Y., Wang L., Song Y., Zhang W., Connectivity analysis and application of fracture cave carbonate reservoir in Tazhong, Science Technology and Engineering, 16, 5, pp. 147-152, (2016)","X.

The financial rules under the traditional financial supervision paradigm are usually the product of crisis-based legislation and regulation. They are characterized by ""command and control""and cannot cope with the pan-financialization brought by financial technology, the frequent financial risks, the endogenous and exogenous financial systems. Risk and other issues. The transformation of the financial regulatory paradigm is imperative. According to the analysis of big data, the new paradigm of financial supervision requires the establishment of cross-industry risk supervision institutions on top of specialized financial supervision institutions to prevent risks from being passed inside and outside the financial system. Requires adaptive supervision to reasonably allocate financial rule-making powers among financial legislatures, financial regulatory agencies, and regulated institutions; requires experimental supervision to deal with time-consuming issues of supervisory intervention; requires real-time or true data-driven supervision.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Adaptive Regulation; Big Data Analysis; Cross-industry Risk Regulation; Experimental Supervision; Financial Technology; Regulatory Technology","Command and control systems; Laws and legislation; Risk assessment; Command and control; Computer technology; Financial efficiency; Financial products; Financial risks; Financial system; Regulatory agencies; Technology-based; Fintech","","","","","","","Lee E, Financial Inclusion: A Challenge to the New Paradigm of Financial Technology, Regulatory Technology and Anti-Money Laundering Law, (2017); Lannoo K, The New Financial Regulatory Paradigm: A Transatlantic Perspective [J] Ceps Papers, (2013); Jackson H E, Substituted Compliance: The Emergence, Challenges, and Evolution of a New Regulatory Paradigm, Journal of Financial Regulation | Oxford Academic [J] Journal of Financial Regulation, 1, pp. 169-205, (2015); Papaikonomou V L, Credit rating agencies and global financial crisis: Need for a paradigm shift in financial market regulation [J], Studies in Economics & Finance, 27, pp. 161-174, (2010); Williams T, Who Wants to Watch?

The results show that: (1) Taking human capital endowment as the threshold variable, the influence mechanism of financial technology development on regional innovation capability has an inverted S-shaped double threshold effect, that is, the driving effect of financial technology development on regional innovation capability has the “optimal range” of human capital absorption capability; (2) When the endowment of human capital is less than the first threshold, there is a significant negative relationship between financial technology and regional innovation capability, and in this case, financial technology development cannot promote the improvement of regional innovation capability; (3) When the human capital endowment crosses the first threshold, there is a significant positive relationship between the development of financial science and technology and the regional innovation capability, which indicates that only when the human capital endowment can better realize R&D learning, digestion and absorption can the development of financial science and technology achieve collaborative innovation and enhance the regional innovation capability; (4) After the endowment of human capital crosses the second threshold, although there is still a positive relationship between the development of financial technology and regional innovation capability, the driving effect of financial technology has a diminishing marginal effect, which shows that the scale of technology and finance should match with human capital, and unlimited expansion of human capital investment will also lead to the imbalance of the allocation of innovation elements and reduce the efficiency of regional innovation. Based on the empirical analysis results, the paper finally puts forward policy suggestions from the aspects of differentiated development strategy, innovative talent incentive policy, and the construction of financial technology leading center. © 2022 by the authors.

The financial industry and data are closely related. Whether the financial industry can make good use of new information technology is the key to its successful transformation. The development of smart cities has a significant effect on the development of people's livelihood, the process of urbanization, the use of technology, the solution of urban problems, and the improvement of economic levels. This also provides a good choice for the development of cities in each country. For better development, it needs technical support. Therefore, it is very important to improve the technical level. This research mainly discusses the risk assessment and regulation algorithms of financial technology platforms in smart cities. This study divides the risk decision channels into two paths based on the smart city theory, considers the internal risk factors and external risk factors of the robo-Advisory service platform from the three perspectives of platform characteristics, corporate characteristics, and investor characteristics and exploring the construction of a robo-Advisory service platform risk prediction model based on the machine learning perspective. The design and implementation of a personalized financial investment prototype system, a Python-based web development framework Django, and a variety of toolkits have realized a B/S architecture robo-Advisor. Among them, the function of buying and selling ETF and the trend recording function after buying are realized by simulating the transaction data collected by the data collection module. The study found that the key potential characteristics that constitute platform risks are mainly the listing year of the background company, the age of the platform, the investment threshold, and the search index. To a certain extent, this provides data support for investors and regulatory authorities to evaluate platform capabilities and platform selection. Investors should comprehensively consider platform qualifications when making platform decisions and pay attention to information such as the age of listing of companies with platform background, platform age, and investment thresholds. Only when the quality of people is improved, the quality of the population of this city improves, so that the development of the city has a broad room for growth.

This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that will enable the development of an interoperable financial ecosystem through collaborative open innovation in Botswana. A literature review was used to identify developments towards open banking or open APIs in other countries. The National ICT Policy Review and E-commerce Strategy for Botswana were reviewed to identify developments in Botswana regarding the financial technology infrastructure. The literature review showed the need for collaboration between banks and fintechs as they can both benefit from that relationship. The results of the study achieved all the objectives whereby (i) an Open API conceptual framework that will enable the development of an interoperable financial ecosystem through collaborative Open Innovation was developed, (ii) a mobile payment architecture based on the Open API conceptual framework and (iii) a mobile application as a proof-of-concept based on the developed Open API conceptual framework.

Fintech studies are abundant in developed countries and mainly focus on consumers’ conditions, awareness, habits, and capital. These are expected to differ significantly from the situation in developing countries. We have reviewed factors that can affect the user’s intention, including the Perceived Benefit (PB), Perceived Risk (PR), Belief (B), and Social Influence (SI), and rely on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) model in this research. The survey sample comprises 161 Z-generation consumers with strong flexibility and knowledge about the use of Fintech. We use the PLS-SEM (partial least squares structural equation modeling) analysis method with the SmartPLS software (SmartPLS GmbH, Oststeinbek, Germany) to evaluate the research model. We find that the Perceived Benefit (PB) has the most significant impact on the intention to use Fintech, followed by Belief (B). However, in general, the factors are not significant, perhaps due to many reasons that are intrinsic in Vietnam. Based on this result, service providers, policymakers, and researchers can calibrate the development and research for the following stages. We offer findings different from the previous research, thus especially extending the literature on young people. © 2022 by the authors.

This process is characterized by the dominance of infocommunications over the financial essence. In this regard, many FinTech development scenarios, forecasts and programs are fragmented, unstructured and lack fundamentality. The research purpose is to conduct a systematic analysis of financial technology development, to identify its priorities and contradictions. The main research methods are a systemic analysis and logical modeling. Based on the created structural-logical FinTech model, its current image was formed, the consequences were determined, challenges and contradictions were identified. The most pressing issues include the construction of institutions of the future; creation of a theoretical FinTech platform; ensuring cybersecurity; formation of adequate models and competencies of specialists. The scientific novelty of this study implies the identification of these problems and the presentation of recommendations for their implementation and resolution.

This paper uses data mining technology to construct an index of the degree of financial technology application of G-SIBs, and uses the 2019 G-SIBs data to examine the heterogeneous impact of financial technology application on different types of G-SIBs risks. The results show that: with the adjustment of G-SIBs itself and the standardization of supervision, the risk-taking level of G-SIBs is effectively suppressed. Non-systemic and significant banks have good risk-taking ability. In this process, G-SIBs seized some high-quality and low-risk customers of small and medium-sized banks due to its advantages in capital cost, which had crowding-out effect on small and medium-sized banks.  © 2021 ACM.","Bank risk; Data mining; Evaluation; Financial technology; Global systemically important banks","Engineering education; Finance; Risk management; Ability evaluation; Bank risk; Evaluation; Financial innovation; Financial products; Global systemically important bank; Risk taking; Science and Technology; Scientific and technological achievements; Technology application; Data mining","","","","","","","Arief U., Husodo Z.A., Systemically important banks in Indonesia: Findings from multivariate garch conditional value at risk, Indonesian Capital Market Review, 11, 2019, pp. 119-129, (2020); Xue J., Research on books information management of university based on data mining technology, Information Technology, 2, pp. 75-78, (2019); Yan H., Ziyan, Et al., Financial risk analysis and earlywarning research based on data mining technology, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1187, 5, (2019); Sun Q., Wu J., Rong W., Et al., Formative assessment of programming language learning based on peer code review: Implementation and experience report, Tsinghua Science and Technology, 24, 4, pp. 55-66, (2019); SavChina O.V., Sidorina E.A., SavChina O.V., Et al., Financial sustainability assessment of the largest systemically important credit institutions in the context of the global instability, International Journal of Financial Research, 12, 2, (2021); Caliskan H., Cevik E.I., Cevik N.K., Et al., Identifying systemically important financial institutions in Turkey, Research in International Business and Finance, 56, 1, (2020); Mahmood Y., Ahmad M., Rizwan F., Et al., Do banking sector concentration, banking sector development and equity market development influence firms' financial flexibility, Evidence from Pakistan.

Despite this, a major part of the population faces poverty and economic inequality which in turn impacts the overall economic growth. Financial inclusion remains a largely researched topic as it has the potential to improve livelihoods of low-income individuals. Major parts of the population in developing regions reside in rural areas which leads them to having limited access to financial services. Digital financial technology has been identified as a potential solution in accelerating developing markets towards financial inclusion. Substantial evidence has been provided in the previous literature which indicates that an acceleration towards financial inclusion can have a positive impact on the economy. The application of digital technology, inclusive of Artificial Intelligence, may serve as a powerful tool to help individuals in developing markets obtain access to financial institutions as well as the services they may provide.  © 2022 The Authors.

Based on Chinese city data from 2010 to 2019, this paper conducts a dynamic evaluation of urban digital financial technology through grey target theory and uses social network analysis methods to study the network structure characteristics of urban digital financial technology and its impact on commercial bank risks. The study found that the spatial network of urban digital financial technology shows a trend of complexity and closeness, developed cities occupy a central position in the network of digital financial technology linkages and are net spillovers of urban digital financial technology. Further research on the impact of urban digital financial network structure on commercial bank risk found that both the overall network structure of urban digital financial technology and individual network structure have a significant inhibiting effect on commercial bank risk. Therefore, this paper focuses on the balanced development of digital financial technology in cities, while seeking to further exert the demonstration role of developed cities and achieve the reduction of risk level of commercial banks through the increase of overall network density and the decrease of network efficiency and network hierarchy. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Yet our knowledge of the emancipatory potential of digital entrepreneurship remains limited because few studies have gone beyond the conventional emphasis on profits and wealth creation. Drawing on the emancipatory perspective that views entrepreneurship as change creation through the removal of constraints, this article examines how emancipation can occur through the actions of digital entrepreneurs. Using an empirical investigation of entrepreneurial endeavours set against disadvantaged communities in Indonesia, we uncover constraints facing a developing economy and the role of digital technologies in ameliorating them. Through extensive fieldwork and in-depth case study analyses, we identify constraining societal norms and restrictive practices, as well as the three forms of digital enablement - to emulate services, aggregate capital and equalise opportunities – necessary for the enactment of digitally enabled emancipation. We present a framework to illustrate the enactment of emancipatory digital entrepreneurship for the inclusive development of businesses and communities. © 2020","Case study; Digital entrepreneurship; Emancipation; Fintech","Information science; Information systems; Case study analysis; Developing economies; Digital technologies; Empirical investigation; Indonesia; Societal implications; Wealth creation; Fintech","","","","","Australia-ASEAN Council of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Australian Government, (AAC198)","This research is supported by the Australia-ASEAN Council of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australian Government (Grant number: AAC198 ).

In recent years, digital finance has become an important engine for China's high-quality development. Whether digital finance can give full play to the advantages of technology enabling finance to alleviate financing constraints of private enterprises is the research issue of this paper. This paper conducts a quantitative empirical study on the relationship between digital finance and financing constraints of private enterprises by using the data of private listed companies in China from 2011 to 2018. The results show that digital finance significantly alleviates the financing constraints of private enterprises. Moreover, this paper finds that the impact of digital finance on financing constraints of private enterprises is more significant for enterprises with younger age, smaller scale and lower maturity. And digital finance can also improve the allocation efficiency of credit resources. Further mechanism analysis finds that the development of digital finance can alleviates the financing constraints of private enterprises by providing more adequate financial support, easing the information asymmetry and reducing the principal-agent cost. The research finding of this paper adds a new evidence to evaluate the economic consequences of digital finance in China, and also provides countermeasures to alleviate the financing difficulties of private enterprises. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China.

All financial institutions should constantly develop the innovation ability and practicability of financial technology, and strive to achieve the goal of deep integration of finance and technology, which subverts the traditional business model of commercial banks to a great extent. Commercial banks are the premise and foundation for maintaining the stable operation of the financial industry. With the increasingly complex situation and changes in the external environment, the rise of financial technology gradually promotes the strategic transformation of commercial banks. Commercial banks at home and abroad have continuously increased investment in financial technology.

Areas such as digital currencies, payments, funding, investment, risk management and insurance are experiencing major changes driven by the adoption of financial technology. Consumers by other side are increasingly adopting new information technologies and digital resources. Value chains tend to no longer present standard solutions to become more dynamic with personalised solutions, integrating physical or digital products/services, developed from information about consumer preferences. The objective of implementing financial technology in traditional financial services, allows an improvement in the experience and efficiency of the services provided. To accomplish this goal is essential identifying the variables across the entire market that influence consumer behaviour, with the aim of achieving a relevant digital relationship and value generation for all current and potential users.

Households are economic actors that play a significant role in the economic condition. Thus, households’ consumption expenditures are a variable that deserves a through analysis in an economy. This study aims to identify the impact of financial technology on household consumption by using the theory of the absolute income hypothesis. We use the partial adjustment model (PAM) approach and the Chow test to detect the structural change on households’ consumption function in Indonesia with the observation period of 1990–2017. The results demonstrate that Indonesian households’ consumption function exhibits structural change because of the development of financial technology 3.0 era that started in 2000. Besides, the partial adjustment model also suggests that financial technology positively affects Indonesian house-holds’ consumption in both short-run and long-run. The findings imply that on the one hand, the findings are a positive signal to rely on finteh as the factor that encourages economic growth in Indonesia. On the other hand, the results indicate that fintech motivates the public to be more consumptive that will potentially lead to higher inflation rates. © 2022 The Author(s).

Fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic. This is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being. We have used the ‘bibliometrix 3.0’ package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically. The study suggests that ‘ACM International Conference Proceedings’ is the core source of published fintech literature. China leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications. Bina Nusantara University is the most relevant affiliation. Arner and Buckley provide impactful fintech literature. In the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes. These research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech. The study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams. These research streams are related to ‘cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology’, ‘financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech)’, and ‘machine learning and deep learning innovations’. The study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density. These various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics. © 2021 by the authors.

The most impacted sectors are the financial institutions, which are leading the trend. However, due to not using financial data in most of the previous literature still, we are not sure enough about how financial technology will reshape and improve the performance of financial institutions. The aim of this paper is to critically review the previous studies that discussed financial technology.

Some authors attributed these problems to the significant financial infrastructural gap in Africa. This study, therefore, investigated the determinants of fintech spreads in a panel of five emerging, 24 frontier, and three fragile African economies from 2002 – 2018. The dynamic panel system GMM estimation technique based on the epidemic and rank theories revealed heterogeneity and significant difference in internet and mobile banking penetration rate among economy types in Africa, with emerging markets reporting higher intercept and lower slope than frontiers and fragile markets. Also, information spread promoted penetration across units; whereas, population growth and literacy only increased it among frontiers and fragile economies but dampened it in emerging economies. This means that users of fintech among emerging markets began to diversify to new innovations aside from those used in this study, hence the decline. Moreover, Africa’s average fintech adoption rate stood at 24%; in South Africa and Morocco, it stood at 43% and 40%, respectively, compared to the global benchmark of 33%. We, therefore, recommend that banks should collaborate with fintech companies to enhance their benefits in Africa. © 2021, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

As one of the largest financial markets in the world, the traditional foreign exchange service industry is gradually entering the era of fintech, bringing new vitality to the foreign exchange market through advanced technology and improving the efficiency of foreign exchange management. However, while enjoying the opportunities brought by fintech to the foreign exchange field, practitioners in both fintech and the foreign exchange industry should also actively face the challenges and try to build a safe and efficient foreign exchange market environment. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

An Evaluation Index System (EIS) for the current situation of Chinese FinTech enterprises is established by considering the impact of the era of the digital economy on the development of FinTech. Specifically, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is introduced to construct the principal component prediction model based on functional data. Then, six Chinese State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) are selected. Their stock prices are predicted using the proposed model through an empirical study. The results show that selecting three principal components to evaluate the financial situations of six SOEs is reasonable. The accumulated variance values of the first three principal components of the stock's closing price and opening price are all greater than 85%. Thus, the selected three principal components can obtain the potential information of the original data. The gap between the actual value and the proposed model-predicted value of the stocks of the six SOEs is relatively small. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) is 0.105, more than 10%. The predicted values of Huadian Energy and China Shenhua are 9.4% and 8.5%, respectively, second only to CNPC. Therefore, the proposed principal component prediction model based on functional data can predict the closing price of stocks well. The accuracy is relatively high and matches well with financial data analysis. This research has important implications for the development of FinTech.  © 2022 Boran Li et al.","","China; Principal Component Analysis; Technology; Costs; Economic and social effects; Financial markets; Forecasting; Mean square error; China national petroleum corporations; Digital economy; Enterprise IS; Functional datas; Mathematical analysis; Model-based OPC; Prediction modelling; Principal Components; Principal-component analysis; State owned enterprise; China; principal component analysis; technology; Principal component analysis","","","","","","","Jiang Y., Prediction model of the impact of innovation and entrepreneurship on China's digital economy based on neural network integration systems, Neural Computing & Applications, 34, 4, pp. 2661-2675, (2022); Horoshko O.-I., Horoshko A., Bilyuga S., Horoshko V., Theoretical and methodological bases of the study of the impact of digital economy on world policy in 21 century, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 166, (2021); Chen Y., Sivakumar V., Invesitigation of finance industry on risk awareness model and digital economic growth, Annals of Operations Research, pp. 1-22, (2021); Hrytsenko A.A., Hrytsenko O.A., Institutionalization of the digital economy: Contradictions and approaches to settling the differences, Economic Theory and Law, 2021, 1, pp. 11-28, (2021); Prokopenko O., Shmorgun L., Kushniruk V., Business process efficiency in a digital economy, International Journal of Management, 11, 3, (2020); Volodymyr K., Zaluzhny V., Kadala V., Guzenko O., Bohatyrova M., Leskova-Hodlevska J., Digitization as an innovative segment of enterprise financial security management, VUZF Review, 5, 3, pp. 13-19, (2020); Abad-Segura E., Gonzalez-Zamar M.-D., Lopez-Meneses E., Vazquez-Cano E., Financial technology: Review of trends, approaches and management, Mathematics, 8, 6, (2020); Abduvakhidov A.M., Mannapova E.T., Mannapova E.T., Akhmetshin E.M., Digital development of education and universities: Global challenges of the digital economy, International Journal of Instruction, 14, 1, pp. 743-760, (2021); Sturgeon T.J., Upgrading strategies for the digital economy, Global Strategy Journal, 11, 1, pp. 34-57, (2021); Wu P.-C., Liu H.-Y., Liu S.-Y., Hsiao J.-M., Can financial technology development change the causality between tourism and economic growth?, Current Issues in Tourism, 24, 11, pp. 1613-1630, (2021); Palmie M., Wincent J., Parida V., The evolution of the FinTech ecosystem: An introduction and agenda for future research on disruptive innovations in ecosystems, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 151, (2020); Susilowati I.H., FinTech in the development of UMKM, Enrichment: A Journal for Pentecostal Ministry: Journal of Management, 11, 1, pp. 200-205, (2020); Candraningrat I.R., Abundanti N., Mujiati N.W., Erlangga R., Jhuniantara I.M.G., The role of financial technology on development of MSMEs, Accounting, 7, 1, pp. 225-230, (2021); Su Y., Li Z., Yang C., Spatial interaction spillover effects between digital financial technology and urban ecological efficiency in China: An empirical study based on spatial simultaneous equations, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 18, 16, (2021); Lv Z., Han Y., Singh A.K., Trustworthiness in industrial IoT systems based on artificial intelligence, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 17, 2, pp. 1496-1504, (2020); Lv Z., Qiao L., Deep belief network and linear perceptron based cognitive computing for collaborative robots, Applied Soft Computing, 92, (2020); Mora-Vega R., Fonseca-Arguello H., Murillo-Vega M., Situación de la economía digital, el comercio electrónico y el ecosistema FinTech en Uruguay, Inter, 22, 45, pp. 204-219, (2021); Okfalisa O., Mahyarni M., Anggraini W., Quadruple helix engagement: Reviews on shariah fintech based SMEs digitalization readiness, Indonesian Journal of Electrical Engineering and Informatics (IJEEI), 10, 1, pp. 112-122, (2022); Barykin S.Y., Kapustina I.V., Sergeev S.M., Yadykin V.K., Algorithmic foundations of economic and mathematical modeling of network logistics processes, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 6, 4, (2020)","B.

Using data of 5.5 million consumer loans by the fifth-largest private commercial bank in Turkey and its fintech subsidiary, we demonstrate that fintech borrowers are on average younger, better educated, have higher income and savings levels, pay less interest and have better credit history than traditional bank borrowers. Furthermore, fintech borrowers are less likely to default. Superior performance of fintech loans is driven by the fintech firm's ability to identify creditworthy borrowers among individuals with low-credit scores. These results contrast with the earlier evidence for developed markets where fintech borrowers are found to be more risky. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer loans; Digital lending; Financial technology; Innovation","","","","","","","","Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency of Turkey, Regulation on digital lending, (2005); Cole S., Sampson T., Zia B., Prices or knowledge?

Banks or financial institutions. DeFi is built on Blockchain technology that stores DeFi transaction data or 'decentralized finance' and aims to create financial services that are open to all. The DeFi platform can operate by itself without any control and is called 'Smart Contract.' It is widely used as an infrastructure for developers. Decentralized Applications (Dapps), which is the purpose of this research aims to study the operating system and capabilities of each platform. The creators of Etheruem, in addition to Vitalik Bulletin, are also other founding members who co-founded Ethereum, some of them have branched out to create their own networks, such as Gavin Woord who spun off to create Polkadot (DOT), or Charles Hoskinson who spun out to create Cardano (ADA), and Fabian Vogelsteller who spun out to create Lukso (LYXe), etc. All three networks are proof-of-stake blockchains, unlike Ethereum, which is Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake system which can do higher processing speed Proof-of-Work. It saves a lot of energy, and instead of having each computer compete with each other to solve the equation in exchange for permission to verify transactions, Proof-of-Stake. The reviewers are randomly selected by the system with higher processing speeds than Ethereum. These networks are called third-generation Blockchain Ethereum. It is about to have a major update called 'Ethereum 2.0' that will change the network to Proof-of-Stake including modifying various systems to make it easier to use for the general public.

We use two samples, one with 231 fintech firms and one with 231 non-fintech firms across 24 industrialized countries over the 10-year period from 2008 to 2017. We find that changes in bank market power have a positive impact on the performance of fintech companies suggesting that such firms complement rather than compete with banks. On the other hand, within the non-fintech sector, we find that changes in bank market power have no impact on non-fintech firms.

Nevertheless, the user’s response mechanism towards financial technology chatbots has been relatively under-investigated. To fill these literature gaps, latent growth curve modeling was adopted by the present research to survey Taiwanese users of fintech chatbots. The present study proposed a customer continuance model to predict continuance intention for fintech chatbots and that cognitive and emotional dimensions positively influence the growth in a user’s attitude toward fintech chatbots, which in turn, positively influences continuance intention over time. In total, 401 customers of fintech chatbots were surveyed through three time points to examine the relationship between these variables over six months. The results support the theoretical model of this research and can advance the literature of fintech chatbots and the information technology adoption model. © 2021 by the authors.

Owing to the recent technological trends in the financial sector, such as mobile money, artificial intelligence, and medical robotics, as well as the rapidly increasing human population and the emergence of new patterns of disease, it is necessary for the healthcare sector to adopt new strategies to deliver efficient and effective healthcare services. Financial technology (FinTech), a combination of financial services and technology, entails the incorporation of modern, innovative technologies by industries into their financial services. FinTech is an endless array of applications, products, and services which includes mobile banking, cryptocurrency, insurance, and investment apps among many others. Any enterprise that employs technology to enhance or automate financial services and processes is referred to as FinTech. This fast-growing industry serves the interests of both the business sector and the consuming public. There have been many applications and uses of FinTech, however, its employment in the field of health remains to be explored further and maximized, particularly in the developing world like Africa. This paper aims to explore the prospects of FinTech for healthcare in Africa. © The Author(s) 2022.","cryptocurrency; financial institutions; insurance; mobile banking; Technology health","","","","","","","","Liu Y., Saleem S., Shabbir R., Et al., The relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance: a moderate role of FinTech technology, Environ Sci Pollut Res, 28, pp. 20174-20187, (2021); Martinez R., (2020); Ciulla F., Mantegna R.N., Dynamics of FinTech terms in news and blogs and specialization of companies of the FinTech industry, Chaos, 30, (2020); Ifeagwu S.C., Yang J.C., Parkes-Ratanshi R., Et al., Health financing for universal health coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review, Glob Health Res Policy, 6, pp. 1-9, (2021); Minh H.V., Pocock N.S., Chaiyakunapruk N., Et al., Progress towards universal health coverage in ASEAN, Glob Health Action, 7, (2014); Simfukwe K., Adebisi Y.A., Oladunni A.A., Et al., The role of health service delivery networks in achieving universal health coverage in Africa, South East Eur J Public Health, (2021); (2017); Sam A., Sonja M., (2021); William A.H.; Elhadi Y.A.M., Adebisi Y.A., Abel U.V., Et al., National health systems strengthening as the primary strategy to achieve universal health coverage in African countries, South East Eur J Public Health, (2021); Al-Hanawi M.K., Chirwa G.C., Kamninga T.M., Et al., Effects of financial inclusion on access to emergency funds for healthcare in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, J Multidiscip Healthc, 15, pp. 1157-1167, (2020)","F.U.

Using a sample of 480 bank-year observation from an emerging market of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) over the period of 2006–2021, we find that the development of FinTech firms over time increases bank financial stability. The study used the Refinitiv Eikon and Fintch Connect databases to measure variables. When we conduct sub-sample analyses by bank size, bank type, and level of corporate governance, we find additional evidence that supports the hypothesis that FinTech companies have an effect on the financial stability of banks. The findings are consistent with a wide variety of model specifications, indices of financial stability, and applications of FinTech. This study is unique and contributes to the extant literature by offering new evidence on the effect of FinTech on the sustainability of banks in GCC. © 2022 The Authors.","Bank; Bank Size; Corporate Governance; Financial Technology; Gulf Cooperation Council; Sustainability","","","","","","","","Abdelhak E.

This study used the 2018 National Financial Capability Study to construct financial stress and the use of financial technology and tested the proposed model with two subgroups: one group with financial education and the other group without financial education. We used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to evaluate our model. Results show that respondents with a greater level of financial stress generally tended to more engage in financial technology. When the role of financial knowledge was considered in the model, the relationship between financial stress and the use of financial technology varied by the type of financial knowledge. Although this study did not identify the onset of the coping process directly, the direct effect of financial stress on the use of financial technology in each subgroup regardless of their financial education experience confirms efforts of looking for coping when facing and responding to financially stressful situations. Thus, this study sheds light on the new technology for financial services as a potential tool for better financial management and as a coping mechanism for those with financial stress. Results from this study provide insights for financial practitioners and educators who help US households manage their financial stress. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Financial education; Financial stress; Financial technology; National financial capability study","","","","","","","","Aguiar R.L., Onur E., Skouby K.E., Aguayo-Torres M.C., Toftegaard T.S., Users, economics, technology: Unavoidable interdynamics, Wireless Personal Communication, 53, 3, pp. 437-442, (2010); Asaad C.T., Financial literacy and financial behavior: Assessing knowledge and confidence, Financial Services Review, 24, 2, pp. 101-117, (2015); Bernheim D.B., Garrett D.M., Maki D.M., Education and saving: The long-term effects of high school financial curriculum mandates, Journal of Public Economics, 80, 3, pp. 435-465, (2001); Boss P., Family stress, Handbook of marriage and the family, (1987); Boss P., Primacy of perception in family stress theory and measurement, Journal of Family Psychology, 6, 2, pp. 113-119, (1992); Britt S.L., Mendiola M.R., Schink G.H., Tibbetts R.H., Jones S.H., Financial stress, coping strategy, and academic achievement of college students, Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning, 27, 2, pp. 172-183, (2016); Brown T.A., Confirmatory factor analysis for applied research, (2015); Carver C.S., Scheier M.F., Weintraub J.K., Assessing coping strategy: A theoretical based approach, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 56, 2, pp. 267-283, (1989); Cole S., Paulson A., Shastry G.K., High school curriculum and financial outcomes: The impact of mandated personal finance and mathematics courses, Journal of Human Resources, 51, 3, pp. 656-698, (2016); Davis C.G., Mantler J., The consequences of financial stress for individuals, families, and society.

A wide range of play-ers is trying to harness the potential of this transition (including incumbents, start-ups, and so-called BigTechs with extensive customer networks, such as the Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple). In the light of this, regulators and scholars are increas-ingly interested in new regulatory tools to address the challenges brought by technological innovation in the financial sector to consumer welfare and competition. The article contributes to these discussion by shedding light on the regulatory approaches to FinTech emerged so far. Further, the piece focuses on the pro-competitive effect of the access-to-account rule enshrined in the EU Directive 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (PSD2). This mechanism represents a very early sector-specific regulatory attempt to nurture competition in the digital economy and effec-tively implement data sharing. In this regard, the on-going UK Open Banking market investigation remedy shows how the antitrust enforcement can be deployed to complement the regulatory toolkit. © 2021, Universidade Catolica Editora.

However, with the change of loan model and the rise of financial technology, existing approaches to credit rating are facing challenges. Therefore, how to improve existing approaches to credit rating has become an important research issue. In this paper, we study the issue of applying social analytics to credit rating. Using Facebook as the data source, we adopt the CART decision tree deduction to analyze social media data of tested users and compare our result of analysis with that of existing approaches.Our study shows that those who have better credit rating also possess certain common characteristics in their social media data. In addition, the application of social analytics can complement existing approaches to credit rating. Our research results can not only be used as an auxiliary to existing approaches, but also be used by the lender to strengthen the risk assessment of the borrower. The proposed approach can increase the flexibility on the amount and interest rate of loans, so as to improve the overall performance of loans.  © 2020 IEEE.","Credit Rating; Decision Tree Deduction; Financial Technology; Social Analytics","Decision trees; Fintech; Risk assessment; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Credit ratings; Data-source; Facebook; Interest rates; Research issues; Research results; Social media datum; Rating","","","","","","","Adali S., Golbeck J., Predicting personality with social behavior, Proceedings of IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, (2012); Breiman L., Et al., Classification and Regression Trees, Routledge, (2017); Frydman H., Schuermann T., Credit rating dynamics and markov mixture models, Journal of Banking & Finance, 32, 6, pp. 1062-1075, (2008); McCrae R.R., Costa P.T., A five-factor theory of personality, Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research, 2, pp. 139-153, (1999); Sherman R.A., Et al., Properties of persons and situations related to overall and distinctive personality-behavior con-c gruence, Journal of Research in Personality, 46, 1, pp. 87-101, (2012)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Cisco; et al.; Fortinet; Logicalis Architects of Change; NARLabs - National Center for High-Performance Computing (NCHC); NetApp","2020 International Computer Symposium, ICS 2020","17 December 2020 through 19 December 2020","Tainan","167420","","978-172819255-0","","","English","Proc. - Int.

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted structural equation modeling using the partial least squares approach to test the hypotheses. Based on purposive sampling, the questionnaire was distributed through an online survey and received 1,262 responses. Findings: The results demonstrate that the latent variables, planned behavior, acceptance model and use of technology, have a significant impact on encouraging behavioral intentions to use Islamic FinTech. The “acceptance model” latent variable is the most influential factor. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted only in Indonesia; therefore, the results cannot be generalized to other countries. However, the study provides important strategic guidelines for policymakers in designing a framework to enhance the development of Islamic FinTech and to achieve financial inclusion. It is suggested that future studies include samples from FinTech users in different countries. Originality/value: This study adds to the literature especially on the factors affecting behavioral intentions to use Islamic FinTech. There are limited studies concerning this topic, especially for Indonesia. The unique feature of this study is the use of a large primary data set that covers most provinces in Indonesia. Furthermore, this study focuses on three types of Islamic FinTech, namely, payments, peer to peer lending and crowdfunding. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural intention; Indonesia; Islamic financial services marketing; Islamic financial technology","","","","","","OJK; Otoritas Jasa Keuangan","This paper is part of the research project on “Factors Determining Behavioural Intentions to Use Islamic Financial Technology” funded by the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan/OJK (Indonesia Financial Services Authority).

In order to train high-level talents of artificial intelligence, the major of machine learning of financial science. China has gradually explored a set of relatively fixed teaching methods for the major of financial science and technology machine learning. However, in combination with the needs of the current era, industrial production puts forward higher requirements for the study of this major, It makes the traditional teaching method backward and unsuitable. In order to seek a more efficient teaching mode, it is urgent to reform the current teaching of financial technology machine learning. In this context, combined with the advanced teaching concept of intelligent information processing course group, this paper re plans the related courses of financial science and technology machine learning specialty, enhances the relevance between courses, enables the courses to connect and cooperate with each other, and forms a chain of excellent course group. strengthen the theoretical research, and strive to build a high-level teaching team to form a more three-dimensional and more close to the needs of the times.

We test our hypothesis through multiple additional tests and robustness tests, such as sensitivity to bank characteristics, effects of the Global Financial Crisis, and the use of alternative estimators.

Despite the interest of these stakeholders, academic research on the topic is scarce and we aim to extend the literature by examining the impact of financial leverage on the performance of FinTech firms. Using a sample of 146 U.S. FinTech firms operating in ten market segments over the period 2000–2016, we find that financial leverage has a negative impact on profitability and risk-adjusted performance. We also reveal that the magnitude of the influence of leverage depends on firm age. The results are robust to the use of a cross-country sample, alternative model specifications and estimation approaches. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","FinTech; Leverage; Performance","United States; age; finance; industrial performance; profitability; technology","","","","","","","Alcock J., Steiner E., Unexpected Inflation, Capital Structure, and Real Risk-adjusted Firm Performance, Abacus, 53, 2, pp. 273-298, (2017); Arellano M., On the Testing of Correlated Effects with Panel Data, Journal of Econometrics, 59, 1-2, pp. 87-97, (1993); Arellano M., Bond S., Some Tests of Specification for Panel Data: Monte Carlo Evidence and an Application to Employment Equations, The Review of Economic Studies, 58, 2, pp. 277-297, (1991); Arellano M., Bover O., Another Look at the Instrumental Variable Estima- Tion of Error-components Models, Journal of Econometrics, 68, 1, pp. 29-51, (1995); Berg G., Guadamillas M., Natarajan H., Sarkar A., Fintech in Europe and Central Asia: Maximizing Benefits and Managing Risks.Washington, DC.: The World Bank Group, (2020); Berger A.N., Di Patti E.B., Capital Structure and Firm Performance: A New Approach to Testing Agency Theory and an Application to the Banking Industry, Journal of Banking & Finance, 30, 4, pp. 1065-1102, (2006); Sound Practices: Implications of Fintech Developments for Banks and Bank Supervisors, (2020); Blundell R., Bond S., Initial Conditions and Moment Restrictions in Dy- Namic Panel Data Models, Journal of Econometrics, 87, 1, pp. 115-143, (1998); Bond S.R., Dynamic Panel Data Models: A Guide to Micro Data Methods and Practice, Portuguese Economic Journal, 1, 2, pp. 141-162, (2002); Brainard L., The Opportunities and Challenges of Fintech, speech, Conference on Financial Innovation at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 2, (2016); Brealey R., Leland H.E., Pyle D.H., Informational Asymmetries, Finan- Cial Structure, and Financial Intermediation, The Journal of Finance, 32, 2, pp. 371-387, (1977); Buchak G., Matvos G., Piskorski T., Seru A., Fintech, Regulatory Ar- Bitrage, and the Rise of Shadow Banks.

Therefore this research needs to be done to observe the potential of fintech in integrating MSMEs in terms of the application of technology and knowledge from the community related to fintech. By using Technology Acceptance Model, this research tries to understand the determinant factors of the fintech application used by MSME. Based on the research framework and model, path analysis method used in this research. This research uses primary data gathered by the questioner, which was distributed to MSME. From the analysis conducted, we can conclude that the external factors tested in this research could have an effect on the behaviour intention through perceived usefulness in MSME practice of financial technology. Large variation in MSME educational background, busineess age and size would become a challenge in promoting fintech application, therefore this finding suggests that fintech should be promoted by highlighting what benefits can be obtained by using fintech application. © 2020.

At present, China is undergoing a vigorous revolution in inclusive finance. This chapter discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) technology empowers the retail credit sector by helping financial institutions to identify accurate risks and improve the efficiency and quality of customer service. AI technology can help effectively identify true customers and eliminate fake and fraudulent applications and can help connect data and solve the problem of missing or fraudulent data. AI can also directly reduce the demand for manpower.

It has become expedient in the face of the drastic increase in Mergers and Acquisitions activity in recent decades and the fact that there has been very little empirical evidence of positive wealth effects and particularly the success of M&A in the insurance sector. This has arisen because most studies in Nigeria have rather focused on the banking sector. Data was obtained from Quoted Insurance Companies from 2003 to 2016 and the Regression Techniques were employed in the study. The result indicated that there exists a positive effect of M&A on Corporate Financial Performance of Insurance Companies. It revealed that a unit increase in merger led to about 4% increase in the Corporate Financial Performance of the merged firms.

A systematic platform framework of “intelligent innovative regulatory tools on financial technology” was proposed, that is, use modern means of science and technology to realize the full life cycle supervision of financial technology innovative applications. The elements of innovative regulatory tools were elaborated, including the underlying blockchain, public opinion monitoring platform, explainable artificial intelligence based on knowledge graphs, and presented the key technologies involved. The new iterative methodology used in the development of the innovative regulatory tools platform was introduced, i.e., the spiral development model and iterative design driven by the hierarchy of needs. Towards the end, some thoughts and prospects on the proposed innovative regulatory tools were put forward, and the regulatory tools are expected to create a set of regulatory technology infrastructure to serve regulatory authorities and financial institutions were pointed out. © 2020 Beijing Xintong Media Co., Ltd..

Unfortunately, the academic literature has paid little attention to the role of ecosystem development and evolution in relation to disruptive innovations. To overcome this oversight, our study defines disruptive innovation ecosystems and illustrates the impact that the financial technology (FinTech) ecosystem has had on disrupting the financial services industry. We offer an agenda for future research on disruptive innovations and ecosystems and discuss the evolution of the FinTech ecosystem. Our study shows that disruptive innovation ecosystems are not only in need of but also deserving of further attention. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial intelligence; Digitalization; Disruptive innovation; Ecosystems; Entrepreneurship; Financial technology; FinTech; Incumbents","Malus x domestica; Artificial intelligence; Finance; Digitalization; Disruptive innovations; Entrepreneurship; FinTech; Incumbents; artificial intelligence; digitization; entrepreneur; financial services; future prospect; information technology; innovation; Ecosystems","","","","","","","The Rise of Insurtech, (2017); Adner R., Match your innovation strategy to your innovation ecosystem, Harv.

The informants of this research were from the Financial Services Authority (OJK) as the agency that supervises Fintech's performance. This research used empirical juridical legal approach by examining the regulations and then proceeding with interviews. The analysis technique used was the descriptive method to explain various symptoms and facts in everyday life. Normative data from this study were from laws, journals, several regulations, and other materials, while empirical data was obtained from interviews with OJK. The results showed that the mechanism of the Regulatory Sandbox was run in accordance with the Regulations of the Governor Board Members Number 19/14/PADG/2017, concerning the limited testing room (Regulatory Sandbox) of Financial technology and POJK RI Number 13/POJK.02/2018, regarding Digital Financial Innovation in the Financial Services Sector. However, the existing regulations of the Regulatory Sandbox was considered unable to provide legal certainty for the financial technology organisers, because the applied mechanism took a long time. This made the objective of this mechanism application to cut the time needed for obtaining a permit for a Fintech product to be launched in the market, was unable to be achieved. The government should provide simplifications of the implementation of this mechanism, without reducing the quality of the Fintech products to be marketed. © 2020 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Financial technology; OJK; Regulatory sandbox","","","","","","","","Aaron M., Rivadeneyra F., Sohal S., Fintech: Is This Time Different?: A Framework for Assessing Risks and Opportunities for Central Banks, (2017); Abolfathi E., Taebi P., Modern Analysis of Financial Statements: Pharmaceutical companies in Iran, Journal of Management and Accounting Studies, 7, 2, pp. 19-23, (2019); Ahn I., Deconstructing the Economy of Debt: Karl Marx, Jürgen Habermas, and an Ethics of Debt, Trans Humanities, 6, 1, (2013); Aliya R., Muhammad S.A., Putri I., Diakses pada, (2018); Amalina F., The Fintech Book: The Financial Technology Handbookfor Investor, Entrepreneurs And Visionaries, Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business, 31, 3; Ansori M., Perkembangan dan Dampak Financial Technology (Fintech) terhadap industry keuangan syariah di Jawa Tengah, Jurnal studi keislaman, 5, 1, (2019); Saurykova Z.M., Ybyraimzhanov K., Mailybaeva G., Implementation of interdisciplinary relationships in education on the basis of science integration, Opción, 34, pp. 353-385, (2018); Arner D.W., Barberis J., Regulating FinTech Innovation: A Balancing Act, Asian Institute of International Financial Law, (2015); Arner D.W., Barberis J., Buckley R.P., Fintech, Regtech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation, Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, (2016); Chattha J.A., FinTech and Islamic Finance: A Regulatory Perspective, Global halal investing journal, (2017); Chisti S., Barberis J., The Fintech Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries, (2016); Cresswell J.W., Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Method Approaches (2nd ed.), (2003); Dahlberg T., Et al., Past, present and future of mobile payments research A literature review, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, (2007); Dhar V., Stein R.M., FinTech Platforms and Strategy, MIT Sloan School Working Paper 5183-16, (2017); Dhar, Stein R., FinTech Platforms and Strategy: Integrating Trust and Automation in Finance, Communications of the ACM, 60, 10, (2017); Fajar M., Achmad Y., Dualisme Penelitian Hukum Normatif dan Empiris, (2010); Fakhriah S., Ikhwansyah, Permohonan upaya hukum peninjauan kembali kedua kali, Jurnal Berkala fakultas hukum UGM, 29, 2, (2017); Regulatory Sandbox, (2015); Haddad C., Hornuff L., The Emergence of the Global Fintech Market: Economic and Technological Determinants, CESIFO Working Paper, 6131, (2016); Hadisiswati I., Kepastian Hukum Dan Perlindungan Hukum Atas Tanah, Jurnal hukum islam, 2, 1, (2014); Hadisiswati I., Kepastian hukum dan perlindungan hukum ha katas tanah, Jurnal hukum islam, 2, 1, (2014); Hapsari R.A., Maroni S.I., Ariani N.D., The Existence of Regulatory Sandbox to Encourage the Growth of Financial Technology in Indonesia, Fiat Justisia Jurnal Ilmu Hukum, 13, 3, (2019); Iman N., Financial Technology dan Lembaga Keuangan, Paper disajikan pada Gathering Mitra Linkage Bank Syariah Mandiri, (2016); Jenik I., Lauer K., Regulatory Sandboxes and financial Inclusion, (2017); Kotarba M., New Factors Inducing Changes in the Retail Banking Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Their Exploration by the Fintech Industry, Foundations of Management Journal, 8, (2016); Evaluation of Mobile Application in User's Perspective: Case of P2P Lending Apps in FinTech Industry, Transactions on Internet and Information System, 11, 2, (2017); Leong C., Tan B., Xiao X., Tan F.T.C., Sun Y., Nurturing a Fintech ecosystem: The case of youth microloan startup in China, Internasional Journal of Information Management (ELSEVIER), 37, 2, (2017); Lloyd J., She A., Gulamhuseinwala I., The emergence and impact of regulatory sandboxes-in the UK and across Asia-Pacific; Marandi M.R., Rahmani M., The Study of the financial effects of divorce on Iran's Law, Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities Research, 5, 4, pp. 1-4, (2017); Muhjad H., Nuswardani N., Penelitian hukum Indonesia kontemporer, (2012); Nicoletti B., The Future of Fintech (Integrating Finance and technology in Financial Services), (2017); Ordanini A.D., Crowd-funding transforming customers into investors through innovative service platforms, (A. d.

The study made a novel contribution to Fintechs' data series by generating an indicator for Fintech using the principal component analysis. The findings reveal a consistent result with previous studies that both macroeconomic and bank-specific factors drive credit risk. We also found a non-linear relationship between Fintechs and credit risk. The U-shaped relationship between Fintechs and NPL revealed that BRICS economies face a dampening impact of Fintech on NPL to a certain threshold after which further adoption of Fintechs will significantly raise credit risk. The robustness checks of the dynamic panel Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) and the fixed effect models also revealed a consistent conclusion. We recommend the optimization of the right Fintech adoption with bank collaboration among the BRICS economies.  © 2020 AESS Publications.","Bank-specific factors; BRICS economies; Credit risk; Financial technology; GDP growth; Macroeconomic factors","","","","","","","","Agnello L., Sousa R., How do banking crises impact on income inequality?

Similarly, the sharia financial technology industry also grows rapidly due to Muslim adoption of information technology for financial transaction. However, limited studies have been conducted to understand the factors that influence Muslim consumers to adopt sharia FinTech products. Through the use of the variables of halal product expectation, social environment, and fiqih knowledge, we surveyed eighty Muslim sharia FinTech consumers to understand whether those three variables affect their intention to use sharia FinTech products such as online loans. The results show that halal product expectation and fiqih knowledge factors have significantly affect Muslim consumers in Indonesia to use sharia FinTech products. Meanwhile, social environment, such as friends or higher Muslim figures, does not influence Muslim consumers to use the sharia FinTech products. We conclude that sharia FinTech companies should focus on improving their products to comply with Islamic sharia principles rather than using social environment to attract Muslim consumers to purchase their products. Future research may require more variable in similar studies to increase validity and reliability. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.","Fiqih knowledge; Sharia financial technology; Sharia FinTech product expectation; Social environment","","","","","","","","Akbiyik F., Eroglu A.H., A Study to Determine Consumers' Attitudes, Expectations and Perceptions for Halal Certified Products: Isparta Province as an Example, International Journal of Social Science Studies, 4, 4, pp. 56-68, (2016); Al-hajla A.H., Nguyen B., Melewar T.C., Jayawardhena C., Ghazali E., Mutum D.S., Understanding New Religion-Compliant Product Adoption (NRCPA) in Islamic Markets, Journal of Global Marketing, 32, 4, pp. 288-302, (2019); Ananta Y., Ada 150 Juta Pengguna Internet, OJK Dorong Peran Fintech, (2019); Andriawan F., Mengenal Fintech Syariah, Apa Perbedaannya dengan Konvensional?, (2018); Basri Y.Z., Kurniawati F., Effect of Religiosity and Halal Awareness on Purchase Intention Moderated by Halal Certification, Paper presented at the International Conference on Economics, (2019); Bishop P.A., Herron R.L., Use and Misuse of the Likert Item Responses and Other Ordinal Measures, International journal of exercise science, 8, 3, pp. 297-302, (2015); Mau Ajukan Dana Pinjaman?

The purposive sampling technique was adopted to select members of the population of financial services consumers in Lagos, the commercial and economic capital of Nigeria. A sample size of 400 was drawn with a total of 303 copies of the questionnaire properly completed, returned, and found suffi-cient to be employed for data analysis. ANOVA regression analysis was employed to analyse the data. The findings of the study indicated that factors such as the increase in technological advancement and its usage by younger consumers are the major drivers of financial ser-vices. Furthermore, it was established that many customers preferred fintech companies to traditional financial institutions in the scope of the delivery of financial services. It was also established that fintech companies have a significant influence on customer satisfaction and are changing the dynamics of competition in the delivery of financial services in Nigeria. © 2020, WSB University.

The results of his research, namely FinTech, could hamper the development of banking, but could also be an opportunity for the banking sector itself. From these results, it was said that banks could be digitized because of the encouragement of FinTech. This is due to FinTech taking a large part of the banking industry's market share.

The study drew from the fact that there is significant latent demand for digital payments in many markets of sub-Saharan Africa, and widespread consumer acceptance of mobile-communications technology is highly encouraging. The study sought to examine the effect of technology, among other things, on money demand. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used panel data and a GMM panel technique to analyse the study's findings. Findings: Results showed that all variables that captured financial technology have a negative effect with money demand (MD). Both Mobile Subscriptions (MS) and ATM (Automated Teller Machines) have a negative relationship with money demand (MD). Practical implications: Based on the results obtained in this study, the study recommended that Central Banks need to monitor and predict the consequences of financial innovations. As African states proceed with reforms of its financial sector, the stability of the demand for money would have to be reexamined and instruments of the Central Bank modified to ensure an effective control of money demand. Originality/Value: A little has been done on the effect of technological developments on money demand in Africa. An understanding of the way technological developments may positively or negatively impact on money demand may guide Central banks in adopting and implementing appropriate monetary policies and actions. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

This review first introduces the development of natural language processing, and then summarizes their applications in financial technology, which mainly focuses on public opinion analysis, financial prediction and analysis, risk assessment, intelligent question answering, and automatic document generation. The analysis shows that natural language processing can give full play to its advantages in the financial field. Moreover, this paper also discusses the problems and challenges for financial technology that are developed based on natural language processing. Finally, this paper presents two developing trends of natural language processing in financial technology: deep learning and knowledge graph.  © 2021 SPIE.","Deep learning; Financial technology; Knowledge graph; Natural language processing","Deep learning; Engineering education; Finance; Natural language processing systems; Risk analysis; Semantics; Social aspects; Deep learning; Emotional analysis; Financial analysis; Financial prediction; Knowledge graphs; Opinion analysis; Prediction and analysis; Public opinions; Risks assessments; Semantic analysis; Risk assessment","","","","","Key Laboratory of Coastal Disaster and Protection of Ministry of Euducation; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20191298); Hohai University, (201905); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, (B200202175)","This work was partially funded by Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under grant No. BK20191298, Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Gran No. B200202175, and Key Laboratory of Coastal Disaster and Protection of Ministry of Euducation, Hohai University( 201905).","Harris Z.

The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. These initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology. However, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy. Fintech offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This provides an opportunity to more closely examine fintech’s research challenges and trends. This study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research; (2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field; and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential. The novel proposal in this study includes theoretical contributions regarding financial technology. Using the systematic literature review approach of Kitchenham, in addition to thematic analysis, meta-analysis and observation to validate the quality of literature and analysis, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis fintech research from an information systems perspective, including the formulation of fintech technology concepts and their development. © 2020 by the authors.

To track this new sector garnering investor attention, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Nasdaq, came up with KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index (KFTX) on July 18, 2016 comprising of 49 constituents. The objective of this paper is to compare KFTX performance with the leading market indices, including S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The data is collected for a period of 12 months, 24 months and 34 months starting from July 18, 2016. The findings of the analysis suggest that the returns for KFTX are consistently higher for 12 months, 24 months and 34 months over S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. The cross section analysis of the 48 KFTX index constituents sub-classified into eight categories representing several different financial industry groups and businesses indicate that for the 34 months period networks and payments gave returns of 82.1% and 71.6% whereas asset management business gave an average negative return of - 51.0% and the specialty marketplace lenders gave a return of 26.6%. This indicates a significant non-uniform growth within the FinTech industry. The findings motivate for an in-depth analysis of the various industry groups and businesses within the FinTech industry and to explore further the reasons and attributes which differentiate these sectors. The study has implications for policy makers, asset management companies and investors in terms of understanding and framing policies for FinTech investments. © 2020","FinTech; index return; KFTX","","","","","","","","Anagnostopoulos I., Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25, (2018); Arner D.

The dematerialization of payments introduces new participants and new products to the market, including non-financial entities. At the next stage of the Fintech development, the importance of artificial intelligence and neurotechnology increases. As the Fintech, the artificial intelligence and the neurotechnology cross national and international regulatory boundaries, the effective cross-sectoral and cross- domain coordination and the mixed financing for global financial investment strategies are critical both domestically and internationally. The particular importance gains the possibilities of resource-maneuvering in global investment strategies, and mechanisms - interoperability - coordination of various infrastructures, digital, financial, telecommunications, IT, government regulation, international cooperation. Due to the variety of such models, it is required to identify trends and promising areas of international coordination of fintech development [9]. What are the factors drawing the development back? What new models of national and international coordination of these technologies are most effective for achieving sustainable development goals. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Artificial intelligence; Fintech; International cooperation; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Dematerialization; Financial investments; Financial system; Global investments; Government regulation; International coordination; Neurotechnology; Technology development; Investments","","","","","","","Charles T., Christopher W., Eija H., Anastasiia M., Institutional Arrangements for Fintech Regulation and Supervisio, (2019); Arner D.W., Janos B., Buckley R.P., Northwestern Journal of International Law and Busines, (2016); Dezhina I.G., Technologies for Recovery and Expansion of Human Brain Resources: Public Analytical Report, (2020); Josh Huang Z., Liqun L., Science, 6256, (2015); G20 Ministerial Statement on Trade and Digital Economy, (2019); Preliminary Report on the First Draft of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence; Fintech: The Experience so Far.

According to the development trend of financial technology, we explore the application of leading indicators from three aspects: optimal transmission, uncertainty visualization, and knowledge graph construction. The optimal transmission theory automatically calculates the cost of matching two time series, which greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of finding leading indicators. Besides, we propose a visualization method to illustrate the uncertainty of leading indicators, which can extract meaningful information from a wide variety of data and models. Furthermore, we propose to build a network of relationships between industries and indicators using knowledge graph. Leading indicators and lagging indicators can be effectively discovered through the proposed methods.

The model resolves the estimation problems of nonlinearity, heterogeneity, and endogeneity. The empirical results support that the causality is nonlinear, bidirectional, and time- and country-varying, depending on each country’s FTI in each period. Under most FTIs, the current inbound tourism growth will crowd out the economic growth in the next period. When the FTI is higher than the threshold (81.27), the current economic growth will harm inbound tourism growth in the next period. For OECD countries with an FTI below the threshold (81.27), tourism companies should actively expand their investment to share the tourism dividend driven from the economic growth in the previous period. For OECD countries with an FTI above the threshold, the governments should adopt appropriate policies to reduce the impact of economic growth on the tourism industry, and tourism companies should increase tourism investment during the periods of economic downturn. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Economic growth;

In the realm of disruptive world, there are many areas in which startup companies are developing their business. There is always contradiction when dealing with innovation as core of digital disruption and how privacy remains as hot issues at the edge of everybody's talks. Internet plays important roles to sustain the trends. As rapidly growing country, 68% of Indonesian has access to the Internet. It drives startup companies on financial technology to innovate more and besides that they must comply to regulation in regard with personal data protection. This research aims to appraise how startup company on financial technology protect users' personal data. Personal data protection principles from international organization and Indonesian regulation regarding personal data protection are used to appraise how ABC Corp as a startup company that deliver financial technology service in Indonesian society. To ensure that its service is qualified and trustable, ABC Corp should be appraised using relevant criteria and qualitative approach. The results showed that most of regulations from sectorial supervising agency have been adhered by ABC Corp. The results bring meaningful insight to improve performance on personal data protection. They can became lessons for similar emerging startup companies in financial technology when acquiring their qualifications to protect users' personal data and keep their sustainability. © 2020 ACM.","data privacy; data protection; digital economy; Financial technology; personal data","Data privacy; Digital storage; Fintech; Improve performance; International organizations; ITS Services; Qualitative approach; Start-up companies; Technology service; Plant startup","","","","","","","Abubakar L., Handayani T., Financial technology: Legal challenges for Indonesia financial sector, IOP Conf.

This study investigates non-linear/inverted U-shaped Fintech adoption process among a panel of 32 African countries spanning from 2002–2018. The study argues that Fintech adoption in Africa will continue to rise and not follow the inverted U-shaped process if sustained through greater trade openness. The dynamic system GMM techniques found a strong evidence for an inverted U-shaped adoption process for the 32 African markets and 24 frontier African markets but violated among the emerging (N = 3) and fragile (N = 5) groups. The first lag of Fintech compatibility and the contemporaneous levels of relative-advantage, complexity, trial-ability and observe-ability were its main determinants. The study concludes that Fintech will be replaced with new innovations in future irrespective of possible sustainability strategy. The need to strengthen African financial markets’ innovativeness to have a competitive edge on Fintech’s replacement is stressed. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.","Africa; Compatibility; Complexity; Fintech; Nonlinear relationship","","","","","","","","Abdul Bahri E.

It is still slow compared to the level of Financial Inclusion in other ASEAN countries. Indonesia index in 2014 was 36%, while the index of Thailand was 78%, Malaysia 81%, and Singapore 96%. Several factors are slow increase in the distance of people's homes with financial services and the difficulty of public access to financial products. OJ K through policies issued Laku Pandai (Financial Technology - based) to tackle the problem. Banyuwangi is the largest district in East Java, with 1,6 million residents in 2017, and 269.267 SMEs in 2015. The amount is deemed to represent the impact of Laku Pandai in East Java. Based on research data obtained through interview, observation, and documentation descriptive qualitative methods found problems accessing credit undertaken by SMEs through Laku Pandai. Therefore, we need to redesign on the credit system of Laku Pandai. The purpose of this research is to develop the credit system of Laku Pandai in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency in achieving financial inclusion, especially in the SME sector.

This study seeks to measure Fintech’s usefulness, its growth and identify its determinants in a panel of three emerging, twenty-four frontiers and five fragile African markets for the period 2004–2018. A dummy variable interactive equation was modelled based on theory to account for heterogeneity between groups. Results from the system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation technique reveal that on average, Fintech usefulness in Africa is a dynamic heterogeneous process. Income per person, level of financial development, Fintechs’ compatibility with users’ experiences, users’ risk perception, inflation rate and financial-openness were the main determinants of its usefulness. Its rapid growth after the 2009 financial crisis suggests that greater Fintech usefulness can mitigate financial crisis among Africa markets. In particular, the growth of Mobile-banking, ATM and Internet-banking as at 2018 are on average 41.8%, 0.4%, and 20.8% respectively greater than its average in the base year 2004. The study concludes that Fintech’s usefulness is driven by economic, financial and psychological factors; therefore, structural transformation, financial development and improved literacy were recommended. © 2021 The Author(s).

We also investigate the influence of fintech firms’ growth (as competitor firms) on banks’ financial performance. We extend our analysis to investigate the differences between conventional banks (CBs) and Islamic banks (IBs) in this relationship and utilise a sample of 40 listed banks from Gulf Cooperation Countries, where fintech growth was impressive in the period 2014–2019. We find a negative relationship between fintech services and bank performance for both types of bank. Furthermore, we show that the growth of fintech firms in a country negatively influences CBs’ financial performance but has no significant impact on IBs’ performance. In addition, we test our hypotheses through multiple additional tests and robustness tests, such as the generalised method of moments. The findings could be relevant to banks, policy makers, and academic research. © 2021 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: Using the existing literature, books, website articles, and online news to explore and address various aspects of FinTech and incorporating the acquired knowledge to illustrate the UAE's initiatives and efforts in adopting and promoting FinTech. Findings: FinTech is the marriage of Finance and Technology, which has existed a long time ago. Hence, the future calls for collaboration between FinTech leaders and traditional financial institutions to ensure global financial growth. Moreover, FinTech can accelerate the development of Islamic Finance through its powerful tools that can be Sharia compatible, and it can lead to a better sustainable future via empowering and enabling Green Finance. Using this acquired knowledge, the chapter illustrates that the UAE has become a global and regional FinTech hub as it contributes profoundly to the empowerment of FinTech via providing the ideal ecosystem for FinTech initiatives to thrive, which has been witnessed to be extremely powerful, especially during challenging times like the Covid-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications: Future research that would tackle different aspects of FinTech in the UAE can use this chapter as a guide toward acknowledging the imperative and the role of FinTech in facilitating financial transactions and perhaps explore ways by which FinTech can be used for wealth protection by paying deeper attention to RegTech and Cy-bersecurity. Originality/value: This chapter contributes as an introductory guide to different aspects of FinTech that are relevant to MENA countries and using this knowledge to illustrate the status of FinTech in the UAE. © 2022 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Finance; FinTech; Innovation; Middle East; Technology","","","","","","","","Abu Dhabi's International Financial Centre, (2021); Allawala A., Islamic banking is getting its perfect storm moment, (2021); Amiri A., DIFC Review | FinTech and Simplification Set to Drive Sustained Islamic Finance Growth, (2020); Amiri A., DIFC Review | FinTech and Simplification Set to Drive Sustained Islamic Finance Growth, (2020); Amiri A., DIFC Review | FinTech and Simplification Set to Drive Sustained Islamic Finance Growth, (2020); Business A., (2021); Arner D., Barberis J., Buckley R., The evolution of Fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm?, SSRN Electronic Journal, (2015); Arner D., Barberis J., Buckley R., FinTech and RegTech in a Nutshell, and the Future in a Sandbox, SSRN Electronic Journal, 3, 4, (2017); Cen T., He R., Fintech, green finance and sustainable development, Proceedings of The 2018 International Conference On Management, Economics, Education, Arts And Humanities (MEEAH2018), 291, (2018); Cherian D., FinTech in UAE: UAE residents now have new ways to spend and save money, (2021); Conner C., Would You Borrow from PayPal?

This article attempts to capture the discussion on fintech, to provide a critique of the literature, and to propose future research opportunities. In order to do so, a list of peer-reviewed journals was compiled, identified, examined, coded, and classified into high-level themes to be reviewed, analysed, and interpreted. After synthesising the notion of fintech in the literature, this article proposes several potential areas for further exploration, divided into the following themes: definition, attributes, adoption, regulation, and competition. Fintech or financial technology is a relatively new subject in the literature but commonly cited as one of the most important innovations in the financial industry. It is expected that this article will help researchers and academics who are interested in studying the phenomenon more broadly. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Regrettably, the difficulty in accessing finance from the formal financial institutions remains the greatest problem to development and survival of MSMEs sector in Nigeria. In the light of this, this paper provided functional solutions by examining developments, innovations and new financing windows available to MSMEs viz-a-viz Financial Technology that is capable of enhancing the goal of financial inclusion as a strategic tool of achieving sustainable development in the MSMEs sector in Nigeria. We classify the methodologies and approaches the researchers have adopted to predict the impact of Financial Technology on financial inclusion in respect to MSMEs financing in the South West States of Nigeria. We notice that MSMEs financing has the potential to be the fourth largest sector to be disrupted by Financial Technology in the next five years after consumer banking, payments and investment/wealth management in the financial sector. We identify that financial institutions need to collaborate and capitalize on the Financial Technology ecosystems by leveraging on artificial intelligence, big data, data analytics and MSMEs friendly applications in effectively lending to MSMEs sector. We observe that Financial Technology has the potential to drive financial inclusion, with high internet, electricity and mobile phone penetration more states will achieve the 20% financial exclusion target faster by the year 2020. This study also provided recommendations for financial service providers, government and regulatory authorities for this emerging sector going forward. © 2020.","Financial inclusion; Financial institution; Financial technology (fintech); MSMEs; Sustainable development","","","","","","","","Abbruzzese J., Fundbox Looks to Streamline the $74 Trillion B2B Invoice Market, (2014); Abiola B., Adedoyin L., Umoren G., Isibor A., Financial inclusion in Nigeria: Prospect, issues and challenges, Proceedings of the 33rd International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2019: Education Excellence and Innovation Management through Vision 2020, (2019); Achugamonu B.U., Adegbite E.O., Omankhenlen A.E., Okoye L.U., Isibor A., Dynamics of digital finance and financial inclusion nexus in sub-Saharan Africa, Proceedings of the 33rd International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2019: Education Excellence and Innovation Management through Vision 2020, (2019); Adebayo M., Imhonopi D., Iruonagbe T., Ozoya M., Isibor A., An overview on the impact of rewards and recognition in retaining university lecturers, Proceedings of the 33rd International Business Information Management Association Conference, IBIMA 2019: Education Excellence and Innovation Management through Vision 2020, (2019); Allen F., Demirguc-Kunt A., Klapper L., Martinez Peria M.S., The Foundations of Financial Inclusion: Understanding Ownership and Use of Formal Accounts, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 27, 9, pp. 1-30, (2016); Babajide A.A., Adegboye F.B., Omankhanlen A.E., Financial Inclusion and Economic Growth in Nigeria, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 5, 3, pp. 1-12, (2015); Trade Finance: Development and Issues, CGFS Papers, No. 50, Basel: BIS, (2014); Beck T., Demirguc-Kunt A., Peria M., Banking services for everyone?

At the same time, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on public health and social and economic systems—including a massive depression of economic activity—has caused citizens, central banks, governments, and academics to rethink sustainable finance as something much more than climate change investment or a trendy industry term. While the outbreak of COVID-19 may itself be the product of human interference with nature, it is not the only challenge human societies face today.Racial, gender, and income inequality and the fate of liberal democracy are as important and should feature prominently in public debate and policy-makers’agendas. © 2021 by Emilios Avgouleas.","","","","","","","","","Sustainable Development Goals; The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) created a financial sector partnership programme nearly 30 years ago in the aftermath of the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. This eventually zevolved into the UNEP Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). An influential UNEP FI report has noted:“Investment needs for the SDGs are huge, with the bulk in developing countries and their infrastructure.The scale of current financial flows is insufficient: private finance is constrained by risk and return requirements, while public finance is in scarce supply. If the resulting financing gap remains unresolved,investment needs will grow over time because of a cumulative effect… could business models be rethought in ways that would increase SDG serving financial flows, but also make them less risky?” U.N.ENV’T PROGRAMME FIN.

The existence of ICT has also increasingly influenced the way business activities are financed via online, known as financial technology (fintech)-based peer-to-peer (P2P) lending companies. This chapter is based on a study which aims to explore the use of e-commerce by small businesses, represented by micro and small enterprises (MSEs), and the role of P2P lending companies in financing MSEs in Indonesia. As an exploratory investigation, it adopts a descriptive analysis. It analyses secondary data and primary data collected from interviews with randomly selected P2P lending companies and owners of MSEs that have been granted loans from these companies. The results suggest that the use of e-commerce by MSEs in Indonesia is still very low. Although national data is not available yet because it is a new phenomenon, this chapter suggests that the emergence of fintech, especially the P2P lending category, will expand MSEs access to funding from formal sources. © 2021, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Acilar, Karamasa, Factors affecting the adoption of e-commerce by small businesses: A case study, (2010); Ahmada S.Z., Abu Bakarb A.R., Faziharudeanc T.M., Khairul A.M.Z., An empirical study of factors affecting e-commerce adoption among small- and medium-sized enterprises in a developing country: Evidence from Malaysia, Information Technology for Development, 21, 4, pp. 555-572, (2015); Alam S.S., Ali M.Y., Jani M.F.M., An empirical study of factors affecting electronic commerce adoption among SMEs in Malaysia, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 12, 2, pp. 375-399, (2011); Azam M.S., Quadddus M., Adoption of b2b e-commerce by the SMEs in Bangladesh: An empirical analysis, (2009); Azam M.S., Quaddus M., Adoption of e-commerce by the SMEs in Bangladesh: The effects of innovation characteristics and perceived risk, (2009); Bakos Y., Brynjolfsson E., Bundling and competition on the Internet, Marketing Science, 19, 1, pp. 63-82, (2000); Balakrishnan A., Boorstin J., Instagram says it now has 800 million users, up 100 million since April, (2017); Barry H., Milner B., SME's and electronic commerce: A departure from the traditional prioritisa-tion of training?, Journal of European Industrial Training, 25, 7, pp. 316-326, (2002); Analisa Ketenagakerjaan Usaha Mikro Kecil, (2017); ProfilIndustriMikrodan Kecil, (2018); Peranan Fintech UntukPemberdayaan Usaha Mikrodan Kecil.LaporanKajian, (2018); Chiliya N., Chikandiwa C., Afolabi B., Factors Affecting Small Micro Medium Enterprises' (SMMEs) Adoption of E-Commerce in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, International Journal of Business and Management, 6, 10, pp. 28-36, (2011); UK fintech VC investment booms to almost $1bn, (2016); Cumming D., Schwienbacher A., Fintech venture capital, (2016); Closing the gap in fintech collaboration.

Banks are increasingly using financial technologies, or “fintech, "" to deliver products and services and maximize their profits. Technology enthusiasts and some consumer advocates laude fintech for its potential to expand access to banking and finance. If history is any indication, however, fintech stands to reinforce digital forms of redlining and enable banks’ continued racialized exploitation of Black and Brown communities. Banking on a Revolution takes the perspective that the financial system needs a revolution-and not the impending revolution driven by technology. Studying various ways the financial system advantages whites by exploiting and marginalizing Black and Brown communities, Terri Friedline challenges the optimistic belief that fintech can expand access to banking and finance. Friedline applies the lens of financialized racial neoliberal capitalism to demonstrate the financial system’s inherent racism, and explores examples from student loan debt, corporate landlords, community benefits agreements, and banking and payday lending. She makes the case that the financial system needs a people-led revolution that centers the needs, experiences, and perspectives of those it has historically excluded, marginalized, and exploited. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Banks; Finance; Financial technologies; Financialization; Fintech; Racial capitalism; Racism; Redlining; Social movements","","","","","","","","Aalbers M., The financialization of housing: A political economy approach, (2016); Aaronson D., Hartley D., Mazumder B., The effects of the 1930s HOLC “Redlining” maps, (2019); Abello O.P., Banks were held accountable to more neighborhoods in 2016, Next City, (2017); Abello O.P., California’s more than dreamin’ about public banks, NextCity, (2019); Abernathy N., Hamilton D., Morgan J.M., New rules for the 21st century: Corporate power, public power, and the future of the American economy, (2019); Abramovitch R., Freedman J., Pliner P., Children and money: Getting an allowance, credit versus cash, and knowledge of pricing, Journal of Economic Psychology, 12, 1, pp. 27-45, (1991); Abramovitz M., Zelnick J., Privatization in the human services: The impact on the front lines and the ground floor, Privatization, vulnerability, and social responsibility, pp. 182-200, (2016); 15 major corporations you never knew profited from slavery, Atlanta Black Star, (2013); Financialization of single-family rentals: The rise of Wall Street’s new rental empire, KCET: City Rising, (2017); Acham C., Revolution televised: Prime time and the struggle for Black power, (2004); Adams R., Consolidation and merger activity in the United States banking industry from 2000 through 2010, (2012); Addo F., Debt, cohabitation, and marriage in young adulthood, Demography, 51, 5, pp. 1677-1701, (2014); Addo F., Seeking relief: Bankruptcy and health outcomes of adult women, Population Health, 3, pp. 326-334, (2017); Addo F., Parents’ wealth helps explain racial disparities in student loan debt, (2018); Addo F., Houle J., Simon D., Young, black and (still) in the red: Parental wealth, race, and student loan debt, Race and Social Problems, 8, 1, pp. 64-76, (2016); Adelino M., Schoar A., Severino F., Dynamics of housing debt in the recent boom and Great Recession, (2017); Adjei-Kontoh H., Chase sparks backlash over tweet mocking customers for spending money, The Guardian, (2019); Adler-Bell S., The high-tech poorhouse: When algorithms are introduced into public assistance programs, the effects are rarely good for poor and working-class beneficiaries, Jacobin, (2018); Agarwal S., Amromin G., Ben-David I., Chomsisengphet S., Evanoff D., The role of securitization in mortgage renegotiation, Journal of Financial Economics, 102, 3, pp. 559-578, (2011); Agboola A., NAACP files racial discrimination lawsuit against Capital One Bank, Black Enterprise, (2018); Ager P., Boustan L.P., Eriksson K., The intergenerational effects of a large wealth shock: White southerners after the Civil War, (2019); Agnew S., Cameron-Agnew T., The influence of consumer socialisation in the home on gender differences in financial literacy, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 39, 6, pp. 630-638, (2015); Agnew S., Maras P., Moon A., Gender differences in financial socialization in the home-An exploratory study, International Journal of Consumer Studies, 42, 3, pp. 275-282, (2017); Ahamed L., The rich can’t get richer forever, can they?, The New Yorker, (2019); Akers J., Seymour E., Instrumental exploitation: Predatory property relations at city’s end, Geoforum, 91, pp. 127-140, (2018); Alexander M., The newest Jim Crow, The New York Times, (2018); Ali M., A brief history of color photography reveals an obvious but unsettling reality about human bias, Upworthy, (2015); Alkebulan P., Survival pending revolution: The history of the Black Panther Party, (2007); Allen P., The singularity isn’t near, MIT Technology Review, (2011); Allison B., McCormick J., Blackstone Group’s Schawrzman among biggest June midterm donors, Bloomberg, (2018); Deeper in debt: Women’s student debt crisis in the United States, (2019); Anderson D., Standing Rock’s surprising legacy: A push for public banks, Yes!

Our result shows that loan and borrowers’ specific factors are significantly associated with the loan rate and loan default, although the relation could differ from one platform to another. Our empirical result shows that platforms focused on very small loan for microbusiness increase their interest rate after the introduction of formal regulation. It could be because of the increase of the borrowers requiring a very small amount of loan relatively much more than the number of lenders. The shortfall of supply then drives the increase in loan rate.

Inclusive growth is conceived in this work as an extension of basic economic rights to access vital networks and services. Thus, FinTech is seen as one of the essential catalysts to increase the productivity of two billion underbanked people and therefore it can serve as a springboard towards inclusive growth. The study of the experience of Taobao in China made it possible to verify this observation through the inclusion of rural populations allowing them to diversify their activity and to contribute significantly to the increase of Chinese rural GDP. The same goes for Kenya with M-Pesa allowing 77% of adult Kenyans to access banking services and therefore ensure them a formal and structured integration into economic life. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Financial inclusion; Financial technology; FinTech; Inclusive growth; Productivity","","","","","","","","China's Taobao Village Research Report, (2016); China's Taobao Village Research Report, (2016); Amadzic G., Masara A., Madou A., Assessing Countries Financial Inclusion Standing: A New Composite Index, (2014); Beck T., Microfinance: A Critical Literature Survey, (2015); Chen G., Faz X., The Potential of Digital Data, (2015); Cheston S., Conte T., Bykere A., Rhyne E., The Business of Financial Inclusion: Insights from Banks from Emerging Markets, (2016); China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), The 40 internet network development statistic report of China, (2018); Cull R., Ehrbeck T., Holle N., Financial Inclusion and Development: Recent Impact Evidence, (2014); Deaton A., The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality, (2015); Easterly W., How did the heavily indebted poor countries become heavily indebted?

The consideration of fintech is more practical and economical. The concept of fintech is related to the rapid development of global technology by creating various new technologies, especially computer technology. This research uses secondary data; the population of this study is the top management companies in Indonesia during the new normal era. The sample in this research used a purposive sampling method, and the quantitative method. The results of this research indicate that the intellectual capital variable represented by conceptual skills has a significant positive role in the development of financial technology in the new normal era. This research posits that intellectual capital also has a role in the development of financial technology in the new normal. This is because the new normal period represents currently a new challenge in responding to the economic crisis that is resulting from Covid-19 pandemic around the world. Therefore, new concepts, new humanity, and new techniques are needed to develop financial technology, so that they can exist and encourage economic growth in this Covid-19 pandemic era. © 2021.

The study employs data envelopment analysis in estimating the efficiency of those rural banks in the region. The findings of this study reveal a decrease in average technical efficiency of rural banks in Bali over the period. Local government-owned banks experienced a greater decline than private banks. Inferential findings reveal that bank profitability, loans, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, bank size, and inflation rates are important factors in explaining the performance of rural banks' efficiency in Bali Indonesia. These findings bring several implications for rural banks' management to consider establishing internal policies as well as anticipating the environmental variable in terms of inflation rate in increasing their technical efficiency.

In the existing research, however, there are disagreements and gaps relating to the efficiency measurement of the financial system's input and output, as well as the impact of financial efficiency on the credit constraints facing the industrial sector. Based on China's provincial panel data from 2008 to 2016, this paper measures and decomposes financial technology efficiency, and selects system equations to comprehensively test the internal and external transmission mechanism of financial technology efficiency. The research finds that: (1) The key to improving the efficiency of input and output of China's financial system lies in the effective absorption and utilization of financial system reform and financial technology innovation, that is, the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology; (2) The key to improving the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology lies in the overall reform of the economic system, including the development of the private economy, the expansion of market opening, the acceleration of service industry development, and the promotion of technological innovation. (3) The improvement of financial technology efficiency is the key to reducing costs, de-leveraging and increasing efficiency in the industrial sector. It can effectively alleviate the credit constraints facing the industrial sector and promote its high-quality development. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the reform and opening up of the economic system with a view to promoting the efficiency of the financial system, rather than simply resorting to financial system reform and financial technology innovation. © 2020 IEEE.","Credit constraint; Financial frontier technology; Stochastic frontier; System equations; Technology efficiency","Efficiency; Engineering research; Facings; Fintech; Industrial research; Service industry; Stochastic systems; Credit constraints; Efficiency measurement; Stochastic frontier; System equations; Technological innovation; Technology efficiency; Transmission mechanisms; Utilization efficiency; Industrial economics","","","","","National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71602002, 71972002)","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China under Grant 71602002 and National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71972002.","Gulen H., Ion M., Policy uncertainty and corporate investment, Rev.

Various transformations are made in overcoming the dynamics of technological advancements, including the mapping of human resources. This study is conducted in the banking industry and companies operating using financial technology (FinTech) in Indonesia. This study aims to identify talent competencies needed in the future, based on current conditions and future needs, through mapping talent in the banking and FinTech industries. Design/methodology/approach: This study provides empirical evidence about the mapping of talent management with eight basic competencies. It uses a mixed-method, explanatory sequential with survey approach in the first phase and focus group discussions (FGD) in the second phase. The questionnaire is distributed to 309 respondents who are the specific decision-makers in this industry. Meanwhile, the FGD is conducted twice at different times with academics and practitioners, human resources and talent managers. This research used analytic hierarchy process as a tool for data processing. Findings: This study provides current competency positions and future needs in the banking and FinTech industries in Indonesia where it found a lot of competence segregation. It also discovered three priority competencies for dealing with Industry 4.0, which included relating and networking, adapting and responding to change and entrepreneurship and commercial thinking. Practical implications: This study is valuable for decision-makers and regulators; these results can be used to find new competencies and talents to develop existing human resources. Also, these results can be used as a basis for policy-making related to the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Originality/value: This study provides new insights on talent mapping in the banking and FinTech industries as a strategic approach in the digitalization era. In addition, this research also adds knowledge related to Industry 4.0 as a result of industry developments in the digitalization era. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking industry; Digitalization; FinTech; Human resource management; Industry 4.0; Talent mapping","","","","","","Indonesian Financial Services Authority; OJK Institute","The authors would like to thank the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK Institute) for providing research grants for this study.","Abi Abdallah R., The introduction of talent mapping as a management best practice: a case study of the International School of Oman, International Conference on Management and Industrial Engineering, (2015); Allen D.G., Shanock L.R., Perceived organizational support and embeddedness as key mechanisms connecting socialization tactics to commitment and turnover among new employees, Journal of Organizational Behavior, 34, 3, pp. 350-369, (2013); Allen D.G., Shore L.M., Griffeth R.W., The role of perceived organizational support and supportive human resource practices in the turnover process, Journal of Management, 29, 1, pp. 99-118, (2003); ArmstrongLaValleLiebermanWalters J., Wilczynski W., Creating a 20/20 customer experience: from customers to advocates, (2005); Autor D.H., Handel M.J., Putting tasks to the test: human capital, job tasks, and wages, Journal of labor Economics, 31, S1, pp. S59-S96, (2013); Autor D.H., Dorn D., Hanson G.H., Untangling trade and technology: evidence from local labour markets, The Economic Journal, 125, 584, pp. 621-646, (2015); Bartram D., The great eight competencies: a criterion-centric approach to validation, Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, 6, pp. 1185-1203, (2005); Beauregard T.A., Henry L.C., Making the link between work-life balance practices and organizational performance, Human Resource Management Review, 19, 1, pp. 9-22, (2009); Beechler S., Woodward I.C., The global ‘war for talent’, Journal of International Management, 15, 3, pp. 273-285, (2009); Bell B.S., Lee S., Yeung S.K., The impact of E-HR on professional competence in HRM: Implications for the development of HR professionals, Human Resource Management, 45, 3, pp. 295-308, (2006); Berk C., Gundogmus F., The effect of work-life balance on organizational commitment of accountants, Management, 13, 2, pp. 137-159, (2018); Boyatzis R.E., The Competent Manager: A Model for Effective Performance, (1982); Bulger C.A., Fisher G.G., Ethical imperatives of work/life balance, Work and Quality of Life, pp. 181-201, (2012); Capelleras J.L., Martin-Sanchez V., Rialp J., Shleha W., Entrepreneurs’ export orientation and growth aspirations: the moderating role of individual human capital, Rethinking Entrepreneurial Human Capital, pp. 63-87, (2018); Cappelli P., Talent on Demand: Managing Talent in an Uncertain Age, (2008); Collings D.G., Mellahi K., Strategic talent management: a review and research agenda, Human Resource Management Review, 19, 4, pp. 304-313, (2009); Creswell J.W., Creswell J.D., Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative and Mix Methods Approaches, (2018); Dalal R., Akdere M., Talent development: status quo and future directions, Industrial and Commercial Training, 50, 6, pp. 342-355, (2018); Delamare-Le Deist F., Winterton J., What is competence?, Human Resource Development International, 8, 1, pp. 27-46, (2005); Building your digital DNA.

FinTech changes the way people pay, send money, borrow, lend, and invest. FinTech enables financial solutions and innovative business models resulting the fusion of finance and smart mobile technology. The emergence of FinTech-related products causes major disruptions in financial services. Though it is yet far from replacing current financial services, it offers financial products and services by non-financial sectors into automation, user-friendly, efficient, and transparent just like banking and financial sectors. The paper discusses its concept, characteristics, and some case studies of local FinTech in Indonesia. In addition, the study deployed text mining analysis to find out the correlation and patterns of FinTech’s characteristics. Then the case analysis highlights a comparative assessment between local FinTech in Indonesia versus global FinTech players within local market-based completion. The findings suggest that local FinTech organizations can be resilient competing with an international FinTech players. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

The purpose of this research is to analyze how the dispute raised from the situations faced by people who involved in fintech peer to peer lending can be solved in fairness. The methodology used in this research are statute approach, conceptual approach, and comparison dispute settlement among Australia and Indonesia through law case study. According to the Indonesian Law as it is stated in BW (Civil Code for Indonesia), companies can settle their loan disputes by filing a lawsuit to the district court. This method is less effective because it is time consuming and costly, while it is not worth with the nominal value of the loan which is not that much. This situation leads to a demand of a faster, simpler and low-cost solution that can be accessed online. This method is called as small claim court method. This method is considerably new and basically is a simplified procedure of the existing dispute settlement. A strong note on this method is its weakness when the disputes happen cross-border. This aspect needs to be improved in many ways considering the current method is only applicable when the parties have the same judicial territory. Hopefully, the information technology strongly supports the task of the judiciary in order to enforce law and legal justice through the application of Electronic Court (e-court) which is in line with the principle of simple, fast and low cost of justice. Vice versa, fintech lending dispute resolution requires procedural law that can compensate for the technology that is developing rapidly. The information technology management referred to information management policies, institutional information management institutional arrangements, and electronic system structuring at the Supreme Court. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Dispute settlement; E-court; Lending; Online dispute resolution; Small claim court; Supply chain financial technology","","","","","","","","Taubaye Z., Rivers W., Mussabekova U., Alimbayeva A., Peculiarities and problems of eponyms (on the material of Kazakhstani periodicals), Opciön, 34, 85, pp. 221-236, (2018); Fakhriah E.L., Mekanisme Small Claim Court Dalam Mewujudkan Tercapainya Peradilansederhana, Cepat Dan Berbiaya Ringan"", Mimbar Hukum, 25, (2013); Clark E., Small Claims, Alternative Law Journal, 20, 3, (1995); Bun S.K., Small Claims Jurisdiction, Singapore Journal of Legal Studies, (1996); Tracy K.T., Craig R.T., Decision announcements in small claims court A recurring judge dilemma, University of Colorado Boulder (USA) Academic Journal Language & Dialogu, 9, 1, (2019); Sourdin T., Alternative Dispute Resolution (5th ed) Autralia: Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Ltd, (2016); Netjes W., Lodder R., Arno, E-Court-Dutch Alternative Online Resolution of Debt Collection Claims: A Violation of the Law or Blessing in Disguise?, International Journal of Online Dispute Resolution, 6, (2019); Isnaeni M., Selintas Pintas Hukum Perikatan (Bagian Umum), (2017); Leonora Bakarbessy dan Gansham Anand, (2018); Tata Cara Penyelesaian Gugatan Sederhana (Small Claim Court), (2017); Komunikasi Peradaban, (2014); Legal Issues pada Pengadila Tata Usaha Negara Pasca Reformasi: Hukum Acara dan Peradilan Elektronik, (2019)","","","ExcelingTech","","","","","","20513771","","","","English","Int.

Various fintech services have a strategy to attract customers. One of the strategies is to offer promos to potential customers or early customers. Promos given to customers will provide maximum benefits when they use accurate type of promo on a promo provided by fintech services. Knowledge of various fintech services and a lot of promo information will provide an effective alternative for customers to use promos. For this reason, applications or software have been developed to provide information on various e-money and e-wallet services and promos. The method used is Lean UX which consists of 4 stages namely declare assumpts, Develop MVP, run experiments, feedback and user research. The result obtained on this research is a mobile androide application that can display fintech and promo information.

This study therefore assesses both the probability and actual rates of fintech adoption in 32 African economies between 2002 and 2018. Based on the information spill-over and rank theories, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the average probability of fintech adoption for all, emerging and frontier African economies to be 50.9%, 83.1%, and 23.1%, respectively, whereas the actual rates are 27%, 40%, and 29%, respectively. The fragile economies, however, had no reasonable probability or actual rates of fintech adoption. Further, odds ratios of 1 or more- suggest a one-unit change in the predicators will exert no impact on these rates. Thus, it is concluded that emerging economies and mobile phone banking drive fintech adoption in Africa, and is largely dependent mainly on structural changes rather than economic and financial factors. The current study consequently recommends improved literacy, ICT training, and structural changes to promote fintech across the continent. © 2020 AESS Publications.

Fintech has brought to the forefront the significance of ICT by providing traditional banking services, which were hitherto the exclusive rights of incumbent banks. This has made banks to increase their ICT expenditure by investing heavily in digital banking and on accelerators, alliances and innovation laboratories. Guided by the Sense and Respond theory, an in-depth interview was conducted and later transcribed manually without the use of any software. The analysis of the findings revealed that Fintechs are both threat and opportunity to Nigerian banks and are impacting positively on their ICT investment decisions. Finally, this study recommends further research on the effectiveness of banks' ICT investments decisions in containing the growth of Fintech in Nigeria.

In this chapter, we study the impact of financial technology on the risk and performance of commercial banks as the incumbent in the industry. The authors combine a cross-country dataset resulting in 336 country-year observations. The authors find that financial technology, more particular the growing of adoption in mobile money, has been considered to increase the risk of banks. However, the authors do not find any evidence that the performance of commercial banks has significantly eroded by the presence of financial technology. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Cross country; Fintech; Mobile money; Performance; Risk","","","","","","","","Buchak G., Matvos G., Piskorski T., Seru A., Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks, Journal of Financial Economics, 130, pp. 453-483, (2018); Iman N., Is mobile payment still relevant in the fintech era?, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 30, pp. 72-82, (2018); Jagtiani J., John K., Fintech: The impact on consumers and regulatory responses, Journal of Economics and Business, 100, 20, pp. 1-6, (2018); Junger M., Mietzner M., Banking goes digital: The adoption of FinTech services by German households, Finance Research Letter, 34, (2019); Lee I., Shin Y.C., Fintech: Ecosystem, business models, investment decisions, and challenges, Business Horizons, 61, pp. 35-46, (2018); Milian E.Z., Spinola M.D.M., de Carvalho M.M., Fintechs: A literature review and research agenda, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 34, (2019); Milne A., Parboteeah P., The Business Models and Economics of Peer-To-Peer Lending.

The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings: This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The paper reports that FinTech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the FinTech industry – from academia to practitioners to regulators. Practical implications: The paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for FinTech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators. Originality/value: The paper is believed to add value to the understanding of FinTech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Cryptocurrency; Entrepreneurial finance; FinTech; ICOs; Innovation; P2P lending; Regtech; Regulatory sandbox; Shadow banking","","","","","","","","Adhami S., Giudici G., Martinazzi S., Why do businesses go crypto?

The emergence and application of financial science and technology in recent years have brought about significant changes in the overall financial system, increased competition in the banking market, and also provided a new direction for China’s financial development. At present, the scale of domestic commercial banks has slowed down, their profitability has declined, and the amount of non-performing loans has continued to increase. Bank operating pressures have continued to increase and operations are in a critical period of transition. Financial science and technology gives full play to the enabling role of technological innovation in financial development, broadens the boundaries of financial development, and further promotes the changes in business concepts, business models, and service methods of commercial banks, and thus plays a role in the transformation of financial science and technology competitiveness in banking operations. It is of utmost importance that domestic and foreign commercial banks have increased investment in R&D for financial science and technology and promote the application of new technologies. At present, China has developed into the world’s largest mobile payment and Internet market. Many populations, as well as changes in demand and habits, have also laid a solid foundation for commercial banks to develop financial technology. To this end, in this new phase of financial and technological integration and win-win situation, if commercial banks can grasp the development opportunities of financial technology as quickly as possible and strengthen the development of financial technology, they will inject new business into the new round of business development. To enhance the competitiveness of bank operations, so as to achieve business transformation. This article analyzes the domestic banking business situation and the impact of financial science and technology, further analyzes and summarizes the status quo and experience of domestic and foreign commercial banks in the development of financial technology, and combines domestic commercial banks’ actual conditions to propose relevant development proposals. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Commercial banks; Countermeasures; Development status; Finance science and technology","Banking; Commerce; Fintech; Investments; Banking operations; Business development; Business situations; Business transformations; Financial development; Financial innovation; Science and Technology; Technological innovation; Competition","","","","","Hua Xia Bank; financial science and technology innovation and development; scientific and technological innovation projects and research","In recent years, major domestic banks have increased their investment in financial science and technology in order to gain a competitive advantage.

From one side this process generates more possibilities for consumers from other side it is related with new risks which arise in banking sector. At the beginning of FinTech era lots of analyst were discussing about disruptive potential in financial services. Later, however, we can see more discussions about cooperation between FinTech companies and banks. The other point which is very important to discuss about is a financial inclusion. The purpose of this study is to analyze the interaction between banking sector and FinTech companies. We use a case study of Lithuania because here FinTech sector is growing very intensively. First of all we try to analyze the scientific literature which analyzes the main aspects of FinTech sector. The second part of the article provides the progress of the FinTech sector and presents the main points of methodology. The research of the FinTech sector in Lithuania was focused on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and political, economic, social, technological, environmental, legal (PESTEL) analysis and main statistical parameters. We also used a correlation and regression analysis together with qualitative assessments. Our results showed that in order to value the interaction between banking and financial technology better to focus on qualitative assessment because only statistical analysis can give different and wrong results. We identified that both sectors interact with each other and there is no a disruptive effect of FinTech in Lithuania. © 2021 by the authors.

U.S. financial expert Noreika (2017) has expressed the opinion that the idea for Lithuania to become a European FinTech hub is quite real. The development of financial technologies in Lithuania has a great support from the Bank of Lithuania, which is our central bank and supervisory institution for financial sector. At the same time established FinTech Association helps foreign investors to come to Lithuania and provides all the necessary information to finance the progress of these technologies. Ministry of Finance also is very active in adding value in FinTech sector growth. The Government supports the expansions of FinTech in Lithuania a lot also. The development of the FinTech sector is one of the government’s priorities in Lithuania.","Acar Okan, Citak Yusuf Ensar, Fintech Integration Process Suggestion for Banks, Procedia Computer Science, 158, pp. 971-978, (2019); The Future of FinTech and Banking.

Further, financial inclusion is closely related to fintech. On the one hand, fintech helps overcome the financial inclusion problem because fintech manages to reach those who were previ-ously inaccessible by banks. On the other hand, fintech will change the payment system structure in an economy that will eventually affect the effectiveness of monetary policy. Using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) with the observa-tion period of 2009–2018, this study aims to analyze the effects of financial inclusion and fintech on effectiveness of the Indonesian monetary policy within the framework of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through interest rate channel with both the cost of capital effect and the substitution effect. The results demonstrate that financial inclusion level affects inflation rate as a proxy of effectiveness of the Indonesian monetary policy, both in the short run and long run. However, the effect of shocks in financial inclusion on inflation is not permanent. Meanwhile, fintech only affects inflation rate in the short run. However, shocks in fintech affect the volatility of inflation rate is permanent both through the substitution effect and the cost of capital effect. © 2020 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use Pesaran et al.’s (2001) autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test approach to cointegration to estimate the long-run relationship between four direct measures of financial technology (automated teller machine [ATM], Internet banking [IB], point of sale [POS] and mobile banking [MB]) and cash holding. Findings: The authors find the presence of long-run negative relationship between cash holding and the four direct measures of financial technology. Practical implications: Despite the negative effect of financial technology on cash holding, the descriptive results highlight increasing trajectory in cash holding. This suggests that structural factors such as ethical climate, literacy level, household characteristics, currency denomination structures, economic uncertainty and infrastructure deficit may account for the pervasive cash transactions in Nigeria and not necessarily the unwillingness of economic agents to use digital platform for financial transactions. Originality/value: This study contributes to existing literature by augmenting the money demand function to accommodate direct measures of financial technology in examining the effectiveness of the policy on cash holding in Nigeria. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ARDL; Cash holding; Financial technology; Income; Nigeria; Opportunity cost","","","","","","","","Abor J.Y., Amidu M., Issahaku H., Mobile telephony, financial inclusion and inclusive growth, Journal of African Business, 19, 3, pp. 430-453, (2018); Adao B., Silva A.C., The effect of firm cash holdings on monetary policy, European Economic Review, 128, (2020); Ajayi S.I., Some empirical evidence on the demand for money in Nigeria, The American Economist, 21, 1, pp. 51-54, (1977); Anwar S., Asghar N., Is demand for money stable in Pakistan?, Pakistan Economic and Social Review, 50, 1, pp. 1-22, (2012); Ardizzi G., de Franceschis P., Giammatteo M., Cash payment anomalies and money laundering: an econometric analysis of Italian municipalities, International Review of Law and Economics, 56, pp. 105-121, (2018); Asongu S.A., Folarin O.E., Biekpe N., The long run stability of money demand in the proposed West African monetary union, Research in International Business and Finance, 48, pp. 483-495, (2019); Bahmani-Oskooee M., Gelan A., How stable is the demand for money in African countries?, Journal of Economic Studies, 36, 3, pp. 216-235, (2009); Belonggia M., Ireland P., The demand for divisia money: theory and evidence, Journal of Macroeconomics, 61, (2019); Ben-Saha O., Jaidi Z., Some new evidence on the determinants of money demand in developing countries – a case study of Tunisia, Journal of Economic Asymmetries, 11, pp. 30-45, (2014); Boel P., The redistributive effects of inflation and the shape of money demand, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 90, pp. 208-219, (2018); Further clarification on cash-less lagos project, (2011); Guidelines on operations of electronic payment channels in Nigeria, (2016); Guidelines for licensing and regulation of payment service banks in Nigeria, (2018); Re: implementation of the cashless policy, (2019); The guide to charges by banks, other financial and non-bank financial institutions, (2019); Chen H., Huynh K.P., Shy O., Cash versus card: payment discontinuities and the burden of holding coins, Journal of Banking and Finance, 99, pp. 192-201, (2019); Chen Y.R., Ho K.Y., Yeh C.W., CEO overconfidence and corporate cash holdings, Journal of Corporate Finance, 62, (2020); Crockett A., Market discipline and financial stability, Journal of Banking & Finance, 26, 5, pp. 977-987, (2002); Dalis D.T., The Nigerian banking system and the challenges of financial intermediation in the twenty first century, Jos Journal of Economics, 4, 1, pp. 93-108, (2010); Dandago K.I., Rufai A.S., Information technology and accounting information system in the Nigerian banking industry, Asian Economic and Financial Review, 4, 5, pp. 655-670, (2014); de Almeida P., Fazendeiro P., Inacio P.R., Societal risks of the end of physical cash, Futures, 104, pp. 47-60, (2018); Folarin O.E., Asongu S.A., Financial liberalization and long-run stability of money demand in Nigeria, Journal of Policy Modeling, 41, 5, pp. 963-980, (2019); Fujiki H., Cash demand and financial literacy: a case study using Japanese survey data, Japan and the World Economy, 54, (2020); Fujiki H., Tanaka M., Currency demand, new technology, and the adoption of electronic money: micro evidence from Japan, Economics Letters, 125, pp. 5-8, (2014); Fujiki H., Tanaka M., How do we choose to pay using evolving retail payment technologies?

We aim at filling this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on robo-advisors using a sample of 39 articles. Our preliminary findings based on the analysis of 18 publications from the IS field demonstrate that prior research mostly focused on customer reactions to robo-advisors, leaving factors that lead to the introduction and development of robo-advisory services, their underlying functionalities and the consequences of their implementation for organizations underexamined. With this study, we aim at extending research on financial technology and supporting organizations that consider implementing robo-advisors in their services by highlighting possible implications of this decision. © AMCIS 2021.","Digital financial advice; Fintech; Literature review; Robo-advisor","Automated algorithms; Digital financial advice; Digital platforms; Financial service; Financial services industries; Introduction and development; Literature reviews; OR applications; Robo-advisor; Systematic literature review; Information systems","","","","","","","Alt R., Beck R., Smits M.

With the rapid development of economy and society, the traditional financial services can not support the increasingly large and complex economic system. As a brand-new format, financial technology can help the financial industry to restructure and upgrade. At the same time, as an international consensus, green development is the only way for China to achieve sustainable development. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study the impact of finance on the regional development of green finance. Based on the essence of green finance development, fuzzy principal component analysis is used to build the green finance evaluation index system in this paper. Taking the data of three provinces and cities in the Yangtze River Delta from 2015 to 2019 as an example, QAP analysis is used to study the impact of financial technology on the regional development of green finance. Research shows that explanatory variables are highly significant, that is, financial technology has a significant role in promoting green finance. Finally, based on the research conclusions, this paper puts forward suggestions on how green technology can better promote the development of green finance from three aspects of top-level design, technical research and supervision. © 2021 CRL Publishing.

We find that while COVID-19 has increased enterprises’ financial constraints, the development of financial technology can mitigate its negative impact.

Design/methodology/approach: The survey was conducted using convenience sampling. Moreover, 205 responses were gathered from users of the Islamic bank. On the same note, the literature on determinants of Islamic FinTech acceptance and TAM was reviewed as well in a bid to contribute to the factors that are instrumental in determining the acceptance of FinTech services. Findings: Findings of the study reveal that Islamic FinTech’s services acceptance is determined by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and also by another variable, which is consumer innovativeness (CI). On the contrary other factors, self-efficacy and subjective norms are found not to be influential in determining Islamic FinTech’s acceptance by Islamic banking users. Originality/value: TAM is extended in the context of Islamic FinTech. A new variable, namely, CI is tested using TAM. CI is yet to be tested, therefore, this paper will be a useful reference for the policymakers, academicians and future researchers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acceptance; Islamic FinTech; Malaysia;

The aims of this first-year study are: (1) To describe the role of partnership in information technology-based value chains on the formation of beef cattle business value chains, (2) to analyze the role of financial technology-based partnership in livestock business performance in beef cattle value chains, (3) to analyze the cost structure and marketing margin formed in the information technology-based beef cattle value chain. The analysis was carried out by adapting the value chain model with entry points for the analysis of the role of partnerships in the value chain, value chain mapping and value chain performance analysis of each chain. The study reveals that the value chains involved in i-Ternak as a website manager are investors, suppliers, breeders and processors and distributors of cattle and meat. The margin obtained is still low as investors get 7.76% per 6 months, the biggest chain with margins is meat processed while the lowest is livestock. The largest share of costs is incurred by the processor who also receives the largest share of profit. Cattle fattening R/C is 1.14. © 2020 Dwi Yuzaria, Basril Basyar and Rusjda Khairati.","Beef Cattle; I-Ternak; Information System; Partnership; Value Chain Performance","","","","","","Andalas University; Kementerian Riset Teknologi Dan Pendidikan Tinggi Republik Indonesia, (26/UN.16.17/PP.RD/LPPM/2018)","This research was supported financially by the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education of the Republic of Indonesia on March 12, 2018 under the skim of Percepatan Guru Besar with the following Contract Number: 26/UN.16.17/PP.RD/LPPM/2018.

This is essential to establish a “Social Licence” for current and future practices. The notion of a “Social Licence” recognises that there can be meaningful differences between what is legally permissible and what is socially acceptable. Establishing a Social Licence entails public engagement to build relationships of trust and ensure that practices align with public values. While the concept of the Social Licence is well-established in other sectors – notably in relation to extractive industries – it has only very recently begun to be discussed in relation to digital innovation and data-intensive industries. This article therefore draws on existing literature relating to the Social Licence in extractive industries to explore the potential approaches needed to establish a Social Licence for emerging data-intensive industries. Additionally, it draws on well-established literature relating to trust (from psychology and organisational science) to examine the relevance of trust, and trustworthiness, for emerging practices in data-intensive industries. In doing so the article considers the extent to which pursuing a Social Licence might complement regulation and inform codes of practice to place ethical and social considerations at the heart of industry practice. We focus on one key industry: Financial Technology. We demonstrate the importance of combining technical and social approaches to address ethical challenges in data-intensive innovation (particularly relating to Artificial Intelligence) and to establish relationships of trust to underpin a Social Licence for Financial Technology. Such approaches are needed across all areas and industries of data-intensive innovation to complement regulation and inform the development of ethical codes of practice. This is important to underpin culture change and to move beyond rhetorical commitments to develop best practice putting ethics at the heart of innovation. © The Author(s) 2020.","data; ethics; Financial Technology; responsible artificial intelligence; social licence; trust","","","","","","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/R033595/1)"," The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the EPSRC, grant reference: EP/R033595/1.

The rapid development of fintech in Indonesia was responded positively by the existence of several regulations issued by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Bank Indonesia (BI). Besides conventional fintech, sharia fintech in Indonesia has also begun to develop where the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has issued a fatwa on Sharia-Based Information Technology-Based Financing Services (Fatwa No.117 / DSN-MUI / IX / 2018). Although sharia fintech has begun to develop, OJK has not accommodated the MUI Fatwa to be a binding regulation. This will give an impact on legal uncertainty regarding supervising of sharia fintech. Ironically, both conventional and sharia fintech become a tool of crime related to the misused of consumer personal data unlawfully. To answer the problem, the methodology used of this article is juridical-normative with qualitative approach. The result of this study is although there are some regulations both conventional and sharia fintech, there are still violations of the law that harm consumers such as approval, supervision, law enforcement including violation of consumer personal data and the culture. Those have an impact on legal uncertainty for consumers because there is no legal protection provided by the state. © 2019 SERSC.","Consumers and Legal Protection; Financial Technology; Personal Data","","","","","","","","Ridwan Aji P., Tumbuh Pesat, 135 Perusahaan Fintech Kini Ada Di Indonesia; Cooper T., The Race to Become the world’s Leading Islamic Fintech Hub; Amalia E.I.R., Strategic Alliances between Sharia Microfinance Institutions and Financial Technology in Strengthening Small Micro Enterprises for Socio Economic Justice”, Proceeding of the 2Nd Interational on Law and Justice (ICLJ) Faculty of Sharia and Law UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta Indonesia, pp. 10-11, (2018); Miskan S., Shahwahid F.M., Sholehudin N.B., Catching The Fintech Wave in Islamic Finance: Regulatory Approach for Malaysia”, Proceeding of the 4Th Muzakarah Fiqh and Iternational Fiqh Conference (MFIFC), (2018); Arner D.W., Barberist J., Buckley R.P., The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm, Georgetown Journal of Internasional Law, 47, (2016); Raharjo S., Ilmu Hukum, (2000); Hadjon M.P., Perlindungan Hukum Bagi Rakyat Indonesia, (1987); Friedman Lawrence M., “American Law an Introduction., pp. 8-10, (1998); Budiharto E., Hendro S., Pengawasan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan Terhadap Financial Technology (Peraturan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan Nomor 77/POJK.01/2016),”, Diponegoro Law, 6, 3, pp. 1-2, (2017); Pelaksanaan Pemberian Kredit Berbasis Tehnologi Informasi Oleh Fintech Kepada Pelaku UKM, (2018); Amin M., Solusi Hukum Islam (Makharij Fiqhiyyah) Sebagai Pendorong Arus Baru Ekonomi Syariah di Indonesia (Kontribusi Fatwa DSN MUI Dalam Perundang-undangan RI), UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim, Malang Indonesia, Ministry of Religius Affairs, (2017); Djafar W., Setianti L., Karunian A.Y., Mengembangkan Pendekatan Berbasis HAM Dalam Kebijakan Keamanan Siber: Mencari Distingsi Rezim Keamanan Dan Kejahatan Siber, (2019); Sirait J., Interviewed, (2019); Zulhuda S., Interviewed.

The increasing of online loan applications is one of the impacts of these technological development. However, the problem is that there are many of these applications that do not have a license to provide financial services yet. Whereas the Financial Services Authority (OJK) in this case has required every financial technology to register a license to operate. Noted, 1,330 people reported to the Legal Aid Institute (LBH), there are 89 financial technology applications with the Peer to Peer Lending platform that are suspected of violating laws and human rights against debitors. The report indicates, the ease of lending in online applications makes customers increasingly entangled. The focus of the writer in this paper is how to protect the debitors customers against the debitors information data, as well as how to sanction applications that are arbitrary and do not yet have a granting permit from the Financial Services Authority (OJK).

Specifically, the chapter investigates the role of disruptive financial technology in financial inclusion, focusing on mobile money transactions on entrepreneurship. Looking at the role of digital money on entrepreneurship matters greatly because self-employment is a sustainable route out of poverty. The study shows that the use of mobile money technology is not necessarily for investment purposes and to make livelihood changes by investing in the creation of new enterprises or self-employment ventures. Most of the current use of mobile money is for transaction payments, such as utility bills and/or payment of fees, like tuition fees. © 2020, The Author(s).","Burkina Faso; Disruptive financial technology; Entrepreneurship; Financial inclusion","","","","","","World Bank Group, WBG","A good deal of mobile money transaction users might be financial liter - ate but might be prevented by infrastructural bottlenecks (e.g. remote rural locations). However, when one looks at the national reporting average number of minutes that individuals spend to get to a mobile money agent, it is only 20 minutes. Hence, we cannot rule out the presence of a fair degree of ignorance or there are other complex factors at work that need to be explored. Part of the recent support from the World Bank is aimed at funding nationwide financial education campaigns via mobile phones for a six-year period (2019–2025) to reach 200,000 by the end of the funding cycle.

The establishment of the model is based on knowledge management considering the relationships between the different capitals, the phases in which knowledge is transformed and the roles of the knowledge nodes. To integrate financial technology with government, business and university nodes, different indicators, dimensions, variables and interrelationships of knowledge management and transfer models are considered for digital businesses related to finance and digital marketing are considered. Using the Delphi method, a model testing strategy is proposed through the qualification of the relationships and the values taken by the variables, according to the perspective of a group of experts in the area, who provide their knowledge and experience, through collecting opinions. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

The first part of the paper focuses on the main developments of financial system. Further, I introduced the notion of FinTech and the impact that this technology has on financial system, followed by an analysis of the benefits and risks implied. Understanding the threats and opportunities brought by FinTech to the financial sector is essential, especially from central bank’s point of view which needs to protect the interests of society, as well as the financial stability and macroeconomic stability. Even though it is currently unlikely that virtual coins will overwhelm sovereign currency, this hypothesis is not excluded, and it is necessary for the central banks to pay more attention to these issues. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Central Bank; Financial system; Financial technology; Monetary policy","","","","","","","","Arner D.W., Barberis J.N., Buckley R.P., The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, pp. 2016-2062, (2016); Issues in the governance of Central Banks, ISBN 92-9197-791-8, (2009); Banking on the future: An exploration of FinTech and the consumer interest, Consumers International, (2017); Fintech by the numbers: Incumbents, startups, investors adapt to maturing ecosystem, Deloitte Center for Financial Services Report, (2017); Annual Report, (2017); Faure A.P., Financial system: An introduction.

Fintech is the term used to designate the application of new technologies to financial services. The aim of the study is to analyse this research subject worldwide during the period 1975-2019. To this end, bibliometric techniques were applied to 2012 articles, obtaining findings of the productivity of scientific research, of the main thematic axes and their evolution. Scientific activity increased, mainly in the past decade, with 45% of publications. The main thematic areas were Business, Management and Accounting, Engineering, Social Sciences and Computer Science. Seven research lines were identified, aimed at analysing the aspects financial, economic, technology transfer, investment, innovation, partnerships and institutions and commercial. Future research lines should develop analyses on banking, financial services trade, territorial development, legal, management, research methodologies and the sustainability of financial technologies. It was verified that there is a growing and dynamic interest in scientific activity on financial technologies at an international level. The findings obtained are a complement to the knowledge of financial technologies and allow the relationship between science and technology to be established, and to inform the decision-making process. © 2020 by the authors.","Finance; Financial technology; Fintech; Innovation; Management; Scientific production","","","","","","","","Muller J., Kerenyi A., The Need for Trust and Ethics in the Digital Age-Sunshine and Shadows in the FinTech World, Financ.

This paper was conducted with the purpose of determining the effect of fintech including services e-payment, bills e-payment, ways of payment and bank accounts with e-government on facilitating e-government services in terms of availability, accessibility, efficiency and responsiveness. Research design, data, and methodology - The problem of this paper is summarized in the lack of studies in this subject. So, a survey was applied on 400 respondents in Egypt to investigate the impact of fintech on facilitating e-government services, in order to determine which fintech item can affect any of facilitating services dimensions.

Fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies that use new technology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of traditional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. In Indonesia, Fin-tech has been widely developed in the past 3 years. Fin-tech is facing a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts new way of living in modern digital technology era. Basically, Fin-tech is offering three main categories such as payment, personal finance and financing. In financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding and also loan marketplace. All of this kind application has some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the using of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, Smartphone, massive use of data with the Big Data, connected objects etc. The using of big data and those new technologies have created new opportunities for these sectors, these developments also raise significant data protection concerns.

Looking this situation, the Indonesian government responds quickly this phenomenon. Indonesia Financial Service Authority (OJK) and Indonesian Central Bank (BI) release new regulations regarding fin-tech service. Although not directly address fin-tech in specific; however, this regulations at least provides an opportunity for fin-tech to flourish. This means that the government responds to this situation well. OJK released regulation POJK No.77/POJK.01/2016 regarding Money Lending Services Based on Information Technology. Meanwhile, BI released PBI No. 18/40/PBI/2016 on Management Processing of Payment Transactions. The two regulations regulate the two most important things in the fin-tech service: peer to peer lending system and payment gateway system. Regulations issued by OJK and BI adopting the Regulatory Sandbox. What does it mean with Regulatory Sandbox? Regulatory Sandbox introduced by The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the financial body in United Kingdom in April 2016. Basically Regulatory Sandbox is a set of regulation which allows both fin-tech startups and established company to test their innovative product in the area of Fin-Tech. It is yet the best approach when dealing with the new technology. Regulators promote the innovation to grow faster and bigger by lowering barriers but still protect the consumers from the harmful effect of new product.","Schueffel P., Taming the Beast: A Scientific Definition of Fintech, Journal of Innovation Management, (2016); Desai F., The Evolution of Fintech, (2015); Arner D., Barberis J., Buckley R., The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?, (2016); Apjii, Infografis Penetrasi & Perilaku Pengguna Internet Indonesia, (2016); Indonesian Fintech Report, (2016); Erik Vermeulen M.F., Regulation Tomorrow: What Happens When Technology Is Faster Than the Law?, (2016); Adiwaluyo I.E., Teknologi Aman, Bisnis Model Ditata, Marketeers, (2017); Alistair Milne P.P., The Business Models and Economics of Peer-to-Peer Lending, (2016); Edy, Fintech World and New Styles in Payment, (2016); Mykhaylo, Applications of Blockchain Technology in Fintech, (2017); An International Perspective Report on IOSCO'S Cyber Risk Coordination Efforts, (2016)","","","Institute of Physics Publishing","","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","25 October 2017 through 26 October 2017","Makassar","138331","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

The authors assume the general methodological approach of grounded theory to study four cases of financial technology platforms from Russia; the sample represents companies focusing both on solutions for the front end (consumers) and back end (middle of the value chain). The research finds that the top executives of the companies, which create and operate the digital platforms, have an approach to business strategy that is significantly different from that of the traditional business. They defy the pragmatism of predicting the market development and planning the company's actions in accordance with such predictions. Strategic paradigm of these companies is based on the notions of inclusivity, dynamism, and reliance on independent participants of a business ecosystem. Though a radical departure from the traditional business strategy, such an approach has brought demonstrable business success across the time span of a decade. The idea of “platform–ecosystem” can also be fruitful as a tool of solving important socioeconomic issues such as financial inclusion in the emerging markets. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Baghbadorani M.F., Harandi A., A conceptual model for business ecosystem and implications for future research, International Proceedings of Economics Development & Research, 52, pp. 82-86, (2012); Bonchek M., Choudary S.P., Three elements of a successful platform strategy, Harvard Business Review, 92, (2013); Bourreau M., Valletti T., Enabling digital financial inclusion through improvements in competition and interoperability: What works and what doesn't?, CGD Policy Paper, 65, pp. 1-30, (2015); Statistics of national payment system, (2015); Corbin J.M., Strauss A.L., Grounded theory methodology, Handbook of qualitative research, 17, pp. 273-285, (1994); Denzin N.K., Lincoln Y.S., Grounded theory methodology.

This circumstance is particularly relevant in the case of the tourism sector, which has been able to adopt and adapt information and communication technologies (ICT) to its processes with greater anticipation. Technological progress and the massive use of information and communication technologies have allowed the optimization of activities carried out by Iraqi companies, be they public, private or of any kind. This advance has increased the use of ICT, particularly in the provision of services, which are trying to solve many and varied problems. Each year researchers talk with tech leaders about the biggest problems they'll face in the near future, where organizations in the current era are facing major challenges due to technological progress and competition on the worldwide web . This requires the use of administrative policies with advanced financial technology to improve strategic performance and competition. This is the purpose of this research, which employed a set of policies and administrative practices using financial technology that have been proven through studies and researches on its effectiveness and how to employ this in improving strategic performance and competition. The research was conducted by sampling 319 respondents within the tourism industry through the use of a structured questionnaire. The results of each respondent's responses were measured using a Likert scale. The results were obtained from the PLS and the structural equation modelling method. The study concluded that these tools required a set of powers to attract financial technology that can contribute to improving strategic performance. © 2019 AJHTL.","E-controlling; E-execution; E-organizing; E-planning; Fintech; PLS","","","","","","","","Agbeja O., Adelakun O.J., Akinyemi D., Analysis of the Effect of Advertising on Sales and Profitability of Company, International Journal of Novel Research in Marketing Management and Economics, 2, 3, pp. 81-90, (2015); Al Shobaki M.J., Abu-Naser S.S., Amuna Y.M.A., El Talla S.A., Support Extent Provided by Universities Senior Management in Assisting the Transition to e-Management, (2018); Al-Dhubaibi S., Abdullah A., The effects of management accounting practices on firm performance: antecedent factors and the role of managerial functions/Ahmed Abdullah Saad Al-Dhubaibi, (2016); Amanchukwu R.N., Stanley G.J., Ololube N.P., A review of leadership theories, principles and styles and their relevance to educational management, Management, 5, 1, pp. 6-14, (2015); Androwis N., Sweis R.J., Tarhini A., Moarefi A., Hosseini Amiri M., Total quality management practices and organizational performance in the construction chemicals companies in Jordan, Benchmarking: An International Journal, 25, 8, pp. 3180-3205, (2018); Arner D.W., Barberis J., Buckley R.P., The evolution of Fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm, Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, (2015); Baird K., Jia Hu K., Reeve R., The relationships between organizational culture, total quality management practices and operational performance, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 31, 7, pp. 789-814, (2011); Bryson J.M., Strategic planning for public and nonprofit organizations: A guide to strengthening and sustaining organizational achievement, (2018); Bulej L., Bures T., Horky V., Keznikl J., Tuma P., Performance awareness in component systems: Vision paper, 2012 IEEE 36th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops, pp. 514-519, (2012); Chin W.W., The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling, Modern methods for business research, 295, 2, pp. 295-336, (1998); Chishti S., Barberis J., The FinTech book: the financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs and visionaries, (2016); Dijkstra T.K., Henseler J., Consistent and asymptotically normal PLS estimators for linear structural equations, Computational statistics & data analysis, 81, pp. 10-23, (2015); Figueroa I., Tanter E., March.

Known by differnet names, it exists in most of the Third World countries. What is peculiar to India is its stage by stage development, incorporating correctives, introducing innovations, and effecting modifications to suit to the changing requirements and environments, culminating in an institutional format.

In this article, we report the cash-based monetary practices of one Ethiopian rural community and identify their implications for the design of new financial technology. Particularly, we focus on addressing the question, What characteristic features should go into the design of mobile money application(s) to embody a rural Ethiopian community’s money practices in social (marriage and death) and religious contexts? Primary data on everyday practices of the community were collected. Analysis of our data reveals that new financial technology design should support lived experiences such as embedded social meaning, segregated and aggregate money control, restricted money use, identity extension and hiding, refusal and acceptance of donations, disclosed and secret money practices, and assigning aesthetics to money. The article concludes by discussing possible ways of mapping these concepts into financial system design, thus contributing toward the development of cashless transactions and a cashless society.

Design/methodology/approach: Two sets of data were used in this study in order to fill the two identified knowledge gaps. First, six years’ worth of data, for the period from September 2012 to August 2018 was collected from Google Trends. This was in the form of search term keyword text. The hypothesis was designed correspondingly, and the results were reviewed and evaluated using a relevant statistical tool. Second, relevant data were extracted from the “Indeed” website (www.indeed.co.uk) by means of a simple VBA programme written in Excel. In total, the textual data for 500 job advertisements, including the keyword “FinTech”, were downloaded from that website. Findings: The authors found that there was a continuously increasing trend in the use of the keyword “fintech” under the category “Jobs and Education” in online searching from September 2012 to August 2018. The authors demonstrated that this trend was statistically significant. In contrast, the trends for searches using both “finance” and “accounting” were slightly decreased over the same period. Furthermore, the authors identified the geographic distribution of the fintech-related jobs in the UK. In regard to job titles, the authors discovered that “manager” was the most frequently searched term, followed by “developer” and “engineer”. Research limitations/implications: Educators could use this research as a reference in the development of the portfolio of their courses. In addition, the findings from this study could also enable potential participators to reflect on their career development. It is worth noting that the motivations for carrying out an internet search are complex, and each of these needs to be understood. There are many factors that would affect how an information seeker would behave with the obtained information. More work is still needed in order to encourage more people to enter to the FinTech sector. Originality/value: In the planning stage prior to launching a new course educators often need to justify the market need: this analysis could provide a supporting rationale and enable a new course to launch more quickly. Consequently, the pipeline of talent supply to the sector would also be benefitted. The authors believe this is the first time that a study like this had been conducted to explore specifically the availability and opportunities for FinTech education and retraining in UK. The authors anticipate that this study will become the primary reference for researchers, educators and policy makers engaged in future research or practical applications on related topics. © 2019, Anna Sung, Kelvin Leong, Paolo Sironi, Tim O’Reilly and Alison McMillan.","Business innovation; Financial Technology; FinTech; Higher education; Retraining","","","","","","","","Agarwal R., Gao G., DesRoches C., Jha A.K., Research commentary – the digital transformation of healthcare: current status and the road ahead, Information Systems Research, 21, 4, pp. 796-809, (2010); Ben S., Lv J., Qian X., Hu K., Luo D., Xu Z., Zhang P., Sheng Q., Zheng Y., Heng Y., Zhou H., Zhang Z., Xu H., Gu Y., Xia Y., Cai K., Jiang N., Huang E., Hao R., Zhang B., Wardrop R., Nan Q., Yang L., The future of finance is emerging: new hubs, new landscapes – global FinTech hub report, (2018); Boeing G., Waddell P., New insights into rental housing markets across the United States: web scraping and analyzing craigslist rental listings, Journal of Planning Education and Research, 37, 4, pp. 457-476, (2017); Chanjaroen C., Pandit Says 30% of Bank Jobs May Disappear in Next Five Years, (2017); Chen L., From fintech to finlife: the case of fintech development in China, China Economic Journal, 9, 3, pp. 225-239, (2016); Choi H., Varian H., Predicting the present with Google trends, The Economic Record, 88, pp. 2-9, (2012); Chuen K., Lee D., Teo E.G., Emergence of fintech and the LASIC principles, Journal of Financial Perspectives, 3, 3, pp. 24-36, (2015); Durmusoglu Z.D.U., Using Google trends data to assess public understanding on the environmental risks, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal, 23, 8, pp. 1968-1977, (2017); Fenwick M., McCahery J.A., Vermeulen E.P.M., Fintech and the financing of entrepreneurs: from crowdfunding to marketplace lending, (2017); Ginsberg J., Mohebbi M.H., Patel R.S., Brammer L., Smolinski M.S., Brilliant L., Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data, Nature, 457, 7232, pp. 1012-1014, (2009); Glaser F., Zimmermann K., Haferkorn M., Weber M.C., Siering M., Bitcoin – asset or currency?

The focus of consumer education is on technology as a driver of economic growth. Applying technology in the financial industry, also known as FinTech (Financial Technology), to increase efficiency and effectiveness in work, saves time and improves the reliability of data. The sample for this study consisted of 410 people in Bangkok and its vicinity. The study found that the majority of the respondents were females aged 21–30 years, who had undertaken undergraduate studies as students and had an income of less than 10,000 baht per month. The analysis of customer behavior found that financial transactions were mainly carried out through technology because of the convenience in relation to time, and customers know about the services available through financial technology from bank employees and the recommendations of people around them and friends, respectively. An analysis of the data on the use of financial institutions’ financial services revealed that the problems or obstacles in the transactions related to reliability and the failure system have a high level of importance. The hypothesis testing found that people who use financial technology and have made three transactions or more have greater confidence in the legal protection of financial transactions, reliability, stability and responsiveness.

Through NGOs, government agencies and banks, vast numbers of self-help groups have been established in recent years: as self-reliant autonomous local financial intermediaries. 85% of the members are women; in India, they have proven to be the better savers, borrowers and investors. Most of them are from the lowest castes and other disadvantaged groups. The SHGs mobilize their own savings, transform them into loans to members and plow their earnings from interest income back into equity. On that basis, SHGs and banks enter into commercial relations of mutual benefit, with low bank and client transaction costs and low risks. In the absence of interest rate restrictions and with repayment rates >99%, SHG banking is highly profitable - a message that has convinced hesitant bank managers in increasing numbers. SHGs are now forming local networks with their own cooperative financial institutions. The program has turned into a social movement, with high expansion rates in recent years. Fuelled by competence and enthusiasm at all stakeholder levels, it expands rapidly throughout India, including marginal and tribal areas. It is probably the world's largest and most successful microfinance program for the rural poor - outstanding in its emphasis on self-reliance and local autonomy. NABARD is now facing the combined challenges of how to disseminate the approach throughout India and the region; and how to continue financing the incremental costs of technical and financial assistance to the participating agencies. This calls for a coordinated donor effort: with the objective of strengthening and mainstreaming the program in India and disseminating it throughout the Asia region.","","India; banking; credit provision; rural finance; savings; self help","","","","","","","NABARD and microFinance, 1999-2000, (2000); Nanda Y.C., Linking Banks and Self-Help Groups in India and the Role of NGOs: Lessons Learned and Future Perspective, (1997); Nanda Y.C., Et al., Task Force on Supportive Policy and Regulatory Framework for MicroFinance Report, (1999); Puhazhendhi V., Satyasai K.J.S., Microfinance for Rural People: An Impact Evaluation, (2000); Srinivasan G., Group Approach to Empowerment of Rural Women: IFAD Experience in Tamil Nadu State, (1995); Srinivasan G., Building a Future - Group by Group: Case Studies of Self-Help Groups in India, (1998); Srinivasan G., Financial to Social Capital: Role of Banks, 28, 1, pp. 53-62, (1999); Clar de Jesus R., Assessment of Linkage Banking Projects in Asia: Synthesis Report, (1997); Holloh D., Microfinance in Indonesia: Between State, Market and Self-Organization, (1998); Kropp E., Clar de Jesus R.B., Linkage Banking in Asia, (1996); Kropp E., Marx M.T., Pramod B., Quinones B.R., Seibel H.D., Linking Self-help Groups and Banks in Developing Countries, (1989); Seibel H.D., Saving for development: A linkage model for informal and formal financial markets, Quarterly Journal of International Agriculture, 24, 4, (1985); Seibel H.D., Financial Systems Development and Linkage Banking: A New Financial Sector Concept of the German Government and its Implications for APRACA, (1995); Seibel H.D., Self-Help Groups as Financial Intermediaries: A Training Manual for Self-Help Groups, Banks and NGOs, (1992); Seibel H.D., Financial systems development and linkage banking, Asia Pacific Rural Finance, (1997); Seibel H.D., Marx M.T., Dual Financial Markets in Africa: Case Studies of Linkages between Informal and Formal Financial Institutions, (1987); Seibel H.D., Parhusip U., Linking formal and informal finance: An Indonesian example, Informal Finance in Low-Income Countries, pp. 239-248, (1992)","","","","","","","","","03934551","","","","English","Sav.

In this article, we examine a new technology application which is coming into its own around the world, in association with the revolution in wireless connectivity: mobile payments. Although there are likely to be nuances and surprises with this technology application, we caution the reader to recognize that many of the same economic forces will be at work as were with other financial services and related technology applications in the past. We apply a robust evaluative framework that permits identification of the relevant stakeholders and applicable theory in the analysis of consumer, firm, business process, market, industrial and social issues. Our findings are intended to guide senior managers in dealing with the economic aspects of mobile payments, and to help identify some important directions for the research. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by incumbent firms' business. This study is a pioneer study investigating the impact of fintech startups on incumbent firms' performance. Incumbent firms involved in this study are rural bank, commercial bank, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by employing net loan to assets while profit was assessed by employing return on assets. This study was conducted in Indonesia by involving all incumbent firms registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange and Financial Service Authority. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after fintech startup emerged. The study reveals that fintech startup disrupts incumbent firms' business because incumbent firms' total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural bank and multi-finance institutions. Business threat of fintech startup does not occur in commercial bank.

Unfortunately, according to Jakpat Survey in 2018 said that until 2018, there's still no adoption of financial technology in health services. This paper aimed to determine the important factors of financial technology adoption by hospital clustering with Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP) method. This paper used the questionnaire from 35 hospital experts as the respondents from all around Indonesia. Scope data in this paper came from outpatient unit administration payment in Hospital. Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (ANP) were used to find the most significant factor from Technology, Organization, Environment, Human (TOEH) framework. This paper found that the most important factor and sub-factor for the hospitals in cluster 1 were technology and compatibility. Meanwhile, for the hospitals in the cluster 2, the most important factor was environment and the most important sub-factor was government pressure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Finance; Hospitals; Risk management; Surveys; Systems engineering; Fuzzy analytical network process; Health services; Importance factors; Indonesia; Money transactions; Technology adoption; Fuzzy logic","","","","","","","Amalia F., The fintech book: The financial technology handbook for investors, entrepreneurs and visionaries, Journal of Indonesian Economy and Business, 31, pp. 345-348, (2016); Dalgleish T., Fintech the Technology Driving Disruption in the Financial Services Industry., 136, pp. x-xi, (2007); Fintech Report 2018, (2018); Jumlah Transaksi Uang Elektronik Beredar, (2018); Dachyar M., Farizal M.I.P., MATEC Web Conf., 248, (2018); Jumlah Rumah Sakit di Indonesia, (2018); JakPat Survey Report [Internet], (2016); JAKPAT Survey Report [Internet], (2018); Nilashi M., Ahmadi H., Ahani A., Ravangard R., Ibrahim O.B., Technol Forecast Soc, 111, pp. 244-264, (2016); Siregar E., Dachyar M., MATEC Web Conf, 248, (2018); Ramadhani Y., Dachyar M., Farizal, MATEC Web Conf, 248, pp. 4-5, (2018); Hardiati I., Dachyar M., Yadrifil, Int.

Examples include internet banking, mobile payments, crowdfunding, robo-advice and virtual currencies. These applications show that the digital revolution is irreversibly changing the way people live, including the way they interact with the financial system. The rapidly growing FinTech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g. data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and has been increasingly attracting political attention at the supranational level. Thus, the fundamental question of this paper is: how is the European Union dealing with FinTech? Due to the broad scope of FinTech, EU regulators face a dilemma: on the one hand, rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation. On the other hand, principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance. A possible middle ground could be found by evolving towards a more dialectic supervisory model. © 2018 Fondazione Gerardo Capriglione Onlus.

Various types of technology based innovative financial business models or financial technology (fin-tech) are growing rapidly around the world, including Indonesia. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) incorporates the fin-tech progress in its work plan in 2017 in the perspective of financial stability. In Indonesia, the Financial Services Authority has issued the Financial Services Authority Regulation No: 77/FSAR.01/2016 on Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services to provide a legal basis for fin-tech activities, in particular services with peer to peer lending models. In practice, fin-tech in Indonesia is not only used to facilitate lending and borrowing, but also used for other business models, especially start-up business, investment and social activities, which are not included in the scope of lending and borrowing. On the other hand, fin-tech development in Indonesia is expected to contribute to economic development, particularly in facilitating micro, small and medium enterprises to gain access to finance. The advantages of fin-tech include cost efficiency and ease of access to finance, but on the other hand there are some obstacles and risks that potentially arise, such as credit risk, insufficient technology, misuse of funds and user/consumer data and protection of national interests such as money laundering as well as disruption to monetary stability. Therefore, in addition to the need for comprehensive regulation, supervisory aspects by the financial services authorities are urgently needed to make fin-tech a part of the financial services sector. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Fin-tech- legal challenges- financial industry","Economics; Fins (heat exchange); Investments; Planning; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Authority regulations; Economic development; Financial industry; Financial services sector; Financial stability; Peer-to-peer lending; Small and medium enterprise; Technology advances; Economic and social effects","","","","","","","Buckley R.P., Webster S., Fin-Tech in Developing Countries: Charting New Customer Journeys, J Capco Inst J Financ Transform, 11, pp. 151-189, (2016); Lee Kuo C., Et al., Emergence of fintech and the LASIC Principles, J Financ Perspect, pp. 03-26, (2015); Director of Supervision and Fin-tech Licensing: Only 7 Fintech Companies Listed in FSA; There Are 600 Fintech in Indonesia, only 157 Are Reported to FSA, (2017); Fintech Innovation: An Overview, (2016); Message from Bank Indonesia Governor-Launching Bank Indonesia Fintech Office, (2016)","","","Institute of Physics Publishing","","International Conference on Industrial Technology for Sustainable Development 2017, ICon-ITSD 2017","25 October 2017 through 26 October 2017","Makassar","138331","17551307","","","","English","IOP Conf.

The analysis focuses on funding resources, operational processes, assets-liability management, risks, and prices. After conducting qualitative research, the result shows that while BPR and fintech have different business models, they both have similarities in financing products. BPR should pay attention to assets and maintaining optimal liquidity level. Fintech does not burden by regulation on assets and liquidity because its financing and the distribution of fund depends on investors. Both BPR and fintech company determine loan pricing by the cost of fund and overhead. The average loan interest of BPR ranges from 21% to 24%, while average loan interest of fintech company ranges from 11% to 30% depending on the results of credit scoring analysis. BPRs are much more hampered by regulation than fintech, including the maximum extent of lending and business activities limitations based on BPR's core capital classified in its business activities. © 2019 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Financial technology; Microfinance; Rural bank; Small bank","","","","","","","","Arner D.W., Barberis J., Buckley R.P., The evolution of Fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm, Geo.

This paper concentrates on protecting sensitive rules when we assume that binary decision trees will be the models to be induced by the shared data. The suggested heuristic hiding technique is preferred over other heuristic solutions such as output disturbance or encryption methods that restrict data usability, as the raw data itself can then more easily be offered for access by any third parties.

We compare the Payment Application Data Security Standard’s (PA-DSS) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standard’s applicability. By highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model. In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms’ industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM’s and Ethereum’s capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard’s results. Finally, we discuss open research issues. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Application security; Blockchain; Compliance; Financial technology; Payment card industry; Privacy; Security frameworks; Security standards; Smart contracts; User data","Blockchain; Data privacy; Ethereum; Network security; Application security; Compliance; Payment card industries; Security frameworks; Security standards; User data; Regulatory compliance","","","","","","","Andrychowicz M., Dziembowski S., Malinowski D., Mazurek L., Secure multiparty computations on bitcoin, 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 443-458, (2014); Atzei N., Bartoletti M., Cimoli T., A survey of attacks on ethereum smart contracts (SOK), Principles of Security and Trust, pp. 164-186, (2017); Bartoletti M., Pompianu L., An empirical analysis of smart contracts: Platforms, applications, and design patterns, International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 494-509, (2017); Biryukov A., Khovratovich D., Pustogarov I., Deanonymisation of clients in bitcoin P2P network, Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 15-29, (2014); Conti M., Kumar S., Lal C., Ruj S., A survey on security and privacy issues of Bitcoin, IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 20, 4, pp. 3416-3452, (2018); Delmolino K., Arnett M., Kosba A., Miller A., Shi E., Step by step towards creating a safe smart contract: Lessons and insights from a cryptocurrency lab, International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 79-94, (2016); Bello G., Perez A.J., Adapted PA-DSS Standards, (2018); Kosba A., Miller A., Shi E., Wen Z., Papamanthou C., Hawk: The blockchain model of cryptography and privacy-preserving smart contracts, 2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), pp. 839-858, (2016); Koshy P., Koshy D., McDaniel P., An analysis of anonymity in Bitcoin using P2P network traffic, International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 469-485, (2014); Luu L., Chu D., Olickel H., Saxena P., Hobor A., Making smart contracts smarter, Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 254-269, (2016); Di Ferrante M., Mercer R., Towards Blockchain Transaction Privacy, (2017); Gray M., Hajduk C., Anatomy of A Smart Contract, (2017); Gray M., Hajduk C., Anatomy of A Smart Contract 2, (2017); Ma S., Deng Y., He D., Zhang J., Xie X., An efficient NIZK scheme for privacy-preserving transactions over account-model blockchain, IACR Cryptol. ePrint Arch., Tech.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month. The data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services. It is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in SOA-based Fin Tech with the understanding and description of SOA, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of SOA layers implemented in Fin Tech applications. © 2018 IEEE.","Architecture; Fin Tech; SOA; System","Architecture; Citrus fruits; Finance; Fins (heat exchange); Information services; Integration; Metadata; Web services; Business productivity; Customer expectation; Fin Tech; Financial transactions; Soa (serviceoriented architecture); System; Technology application; Technology Integration; Service oriented architecture (SOA)","","","","","","","Papazoglou M.P., Georgakopoulos D., Service oriented computing: Introduction, Communications of the ACM, 46, 10, pp. 25-28, (2003); Meredith L.G., Bjorg S., Contracts and types, Communications of the ACM, 46, 10, pp. 41-47, (2003); Arsanjani A., Service-oriented Modeling and Architecture, (2004); Josuttis Nicloai M., SOA in practice, O'Relly 2007, (2007); Richard B., Extensible Architectures: The Strategic Value of Service-oriented Architecture in Banking, (2005); Bret K., Bank 2.0: How Customer Behaviour and Technology Will Change the Future of Financial Services-Marshall Cavendish, (2010); Riad A.M., Hassan Q.F., Service-oriented architecture-A new alternative to traditional integration methods in B2B applications, JCIT, 3, 1, (2008); Papazoglou M.P., Service-oriented computing: Concepts, characteristics, and directions, Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE'03), (2003); Fajar A.N., Legowo N., Services modeling based on SOA and BPM for information system flexibility improvement, International Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering, 8, 4, pp. 2451-2455, (2018); Fajar A.N., Nurcahyo A., Sriratnasari S.R., SOA system architecture for interconnected modern higher education in Indonesia, Procedia Computer Science the 3rd International Conference on Computer Science and Computational Intelligence (ICCSCI 2018), (2018); 10 Best Android Budget Apps for Money Management; Btpn J., Permudah Aktivitas Perbankan Dengan Jenius","","Girsang A.B.; Kaburuan E.R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","6th International Conference on Orange Technologies, ICOT 2018","23 October 2018 through 26 October 2018","Bali","147825","","978-153867319-5","","","English","Int.

For decades, existing benefit distribution approaches have been debated by academics, and presented challenges for conservation practitioners. In passing through long chains of project actors, payments incur high transaction costs and are susceptible to elite capture and corruption. A new type of financial technology (FinTech) – ‘mobile money’ – could offer a novel and available solution to these challenges, at what is now a critical stage in PES and REDD+ implementation. Mobile payments (made via cell phones) have been used successfully in development projects related to micro-credit, micro-insurance, and aid relief, and this commentary considers their possible advantages and drawbacks for PES/REDD+ schemes. Several countries e.g. Cambodia, China, Tanzania, and the Philippines demonstrate both high PES/REDD+ uptake, and high mobile money penetration. In certain circumstances benefit distribution via FinTech may lower transaction costs, enable higher frequency payments, and provide new socioeconomic benefits. It could also improve the privacy, transparency, traceability, and security of disbursements, contributing to more efficient and equitable PES and REDD+ schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Benefit sharing; Conservation; Economic incentives; Environmental services; Mobile payments; Transaction cost","","","","","","","","Adhikari B., Boag G., Designing payments for ecosystem services schemes: some considerations, Curr.

Various industries in the world, including Indonesia, have been disrupted by digital transformation. One industry that has been disrupted by digital transformation is the application of information technology in financial services, namely financial technology in the digital payment section. The ease and convenience provided by financial technology needs to be followed by responsible use, financial technology services need to facilitate their users to have a healthy financial behavior. After conducting user research using questionnaire, users feel that the ease that comes with the application can result in consumerism. In this paper, we present the result of our observation in designing the user interactions of a financial technology mobile application added with a new feature called budget control. The user-centered design approach is used to design the high-fidelity prototype of the application based on the users' needs. The prototype is designed based on usability goals and user-experience goals defined for the users. We conduct a usability testing to evaluate the prototype using system usability scale questionnaire, single easy question questionnaire, and user interviews. The results show that the prototype fulfills the usability and user-experience goals. © 2019 IEEE.","budget control; consumerism; financial technology; interaction; mobile application; prototype; user-centered design","Budget control; Fintech; Mobile computing; Service industry; Surveys; Usability engineering; User centered design; User interfaces; Application of information technologies; Digital transformation; Financial service; Mobile applications; Technological process; Technology service; User interaction design; User-centered design approaches; User experience","","","","","","","Financial Technology, (2013); FinTech Indonesia; Orang Indonesia Makin Konsumtif, (2015); New Fintech Report Highlights Indonesia?s Untapped Digital Finance Opportunity, (2018); Lowdermilk T., User-Centered Design, (2013); Rubin J., Chisnell D., Handbook of Usability TestingXXX: Howto Plan, Design, and Conduct Effective Tests.

The main problem in innovation implementation is the evaluation of the effectiveness of the innovative project. The challenger bank is not just a financial institution but also an information and communication company. It allows presenting these banks in the form of information and communication system and applies the methodology of evaluation of IT projects. Basing on this assumption, a mathematical model was built to evaluate the effectiveness of this bank as an information project. On the basis of which a study was conducted on the dependence of net discounted income on changes in the number of customers of challenger bank and the number of banking operations carried out by them. The modeling resulted that this form of credit institution will be effective if the customer base crosses the line of two hundred and ten thousand people in the first year. © 2019 IEEE","Challenger banks; Cost-effectiveness; Financial institutions; Information technology management","Cost effectiveness; Challenger banks; Efficiency evaluation; Financial institution; Information and communication; Information and communication systems; Information projects; Information technology management; Innovation implementation; Finance","","","","","","","Schumpeter J.A., Theory of Economic Development, (2017); Cypher J., The Process of Economic Development, (2014); Amin A., An institutionalist perspective on regional economic development, Economy, pp. 59-72, (2017); Klochkov Y., Odinokov S., Klochkova E., Ostapenko M., Volgina A., Development of certification model, 5th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization, ICRITO 2016: Trends and Future Directions, (2016); Buchak G., Et al., Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks, Journal of Financial Economics, 130, 3, pp. 453-483, (2018); Dapp T., Et al., Fintech-The digital evolution in the financial sector, Deutsche Bank Research, (2014); Bofondi M., Gobbi G., The big promise of FinTech, European Economy, 2, pp. 107-119, (2017); Nikolova L.V., Rodionov D.G., Bahauovna M.A., Securitization of bank assets as a source of financing the innovation activity, International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, (2016); Vives X., The impact of FinTech on banking, European Economy, 2, pp. 97-105, (2017); Rodionov D., Rudskaia I., Degtereva V., Regional foresight as a technology for development of the regional innovation system, Proceedings of the 29th International Business Information Management Association Conference - Education Excellence and Innovation Management Through Vision 2020: From Regional Development Sustainability to Global Economic Growth, (2017); Philippon T., The Fintech Opportunity, (2016); Cortina L.J.J., Schmukler S.L., The fintech revolution: A threat to global banking?, World Bank: Research & Policy Briefs Paper, (2018); Klochkov Y., Gazizulina A., Ostapenko M., Eskina E., Vlasova N., Classifiers of nonconformities in norms and requirements, 5th International Conference on Reliability, Infocom Technologies and Optimization, ICRITO 2016: Trends and Future Directions, pp. 96-99, (2016); Santos S.M.S., Traditional and Challenger Banks in UK: Comparison in Terms of Customer Value, (2018); Lu L., Financial Technology and Challenger Banks in the UK: Gap Fillers or Real Challengers?, (2017); Worthington S., Challenger banks: Are they for real?

In order to enhance the market efficiency and liquidity, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has granted Thai stock brokers permission to develop and offer their customers algorithm and automatic stock trading. However, algorithm trading on SET was not widely adopted. This chapter intends to design and empirically estimate a model in explaining Thai investors’ acceptance of algorithm trading. The theoretical framework is based on the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 400 investors who have used online stock trading and 300 investors who have used algorithm stock trading were observed and analyzed using structural equations model (SEM) and generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a Logit specification. The results confirm that attitudes, subjective norm, perceived risks, and trust toward algorithm stock trading are factors determining investors’ behavior and acceptance of using algorithm stock trading. Investor’s perception and trust on algorithm stock trading as a trading strategy is a major factor in determining their perceived behavior and control, which affect their decision on whether to invest using algorithm trading.

This growth indicates that people behaviour change in many aspects of life including in economy. One example is (Fintech P2P Lending). P2P lending is a service that offers online borrowing, lenders can loan to small business or individuals. This is in line with the Indonesia Financial Services Sector Master Plan 2015-2019. Indonesia support the rapid growth of the financial technology ecosystem, but there is need good understanding between related parties such as P2P Lending companies, lenders and borrowers. A system dynamics act as calculators to takes value to fill payoff table in game theory. Integration of system dynamics and game theory can produce the best strategy for Fintech P2P Lending in running its business while considering profit for lenders and borrowers. The best strategy is known by use non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. The result shown the best strategy for each player with non-cooperative game is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses high level of ROI. In cooperative game, the best strategy is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses low level of ROI. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.","","","","","","","","","Hadad M.D., Jakarta, (2017); Mateescu, Peer-to-Peer Lending, Data & Society, (2015); G20 High-level Principles for Digitalfinancial Inclusion; Truong O., Centria University of Applied Science, (2016); Chrismastianto A.W., ISSN, Tangerang, (2017); Erman, ResearchGate, (2017); Qingyao C.W., Wan S., 1, pp. 117-130, (2016); Dongyu Chen F.L.Z.L., Springer, 15, pp. 239-254, (2014); Quanlong Liu X.L.M.H., Safety Science, 80, pp. 13-22, (2015)","D.S.

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by financial institutions’ business. This study involved rural banks, commercial banks, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by net loan to assets while profit was assessed by return on assets. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after financial technology startups emerged. The study reveals that financial technology startups disrupt financial institutions’ business and performance because their total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural banks and multi-finance institutions. Business threat of financial technology startups does not occur in commercial banks. © 2019, Society for Alliance, Fidelity and Advancement (SAFA).

And yet, there remains a dearth of research on how these ecosystems may be developed, as well as the economic and social benefits that they can generate. Toward addressing this gap, this research-in-progress paper documents our ongoing work on a case study of the Fintech Ecosystem in Indonesia that is radically transforming the lives of the underbanked in the country. We will present a preliminary process model based on the data we have currently collected to reveal the key drivers, inhibitors, nature and outcomes of ecosystem development across three distinct phases. In doing so, we hope that our study will serve as a foundation for developing a holistic and empirically supported theoretical framework for Fintech Ecosystem Development, and provide academia and practice with insights into unlocking the revolutionary potential of the technology.","Case Study;

The central hypothesis for this chapter was that SMEs' intentions to use IAP were a result of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This chapter also suggested that perceived ease of use and intention was mediated by perceived usefulness of the IAP. Using primary data collection method, 163 questionnaires were collected from SMEs in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia using the purposive sampling technique. The data were analysed using SPSS and SmartPLS. The chapter found that perceived ease of use had significant influences on SMEs intention to use the IAP while perceived ease of use significantly affected perceived usefulness and the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention was mediated by perceived usefulness of the IAP. The results of this chapter suggested strategies to promote the platform as a fund seeking platform for SMEs. © 2020, IGI Global.","","","","","","","","","Achsien I.H., Purnamasari D.L., Islamic Crowd-funding as The Next Financial Innovation in Islamic Finance: Potential and Anticipated Regulation in Indonesia, European Journal of Islamic Finance Voluntary, 5, pp. 1-11, (2016); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behaviour, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 50, 2, pp. 179-211, (1991); Ajzen I., Fishbein M., Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Behavior, (1980); Akter S., D'Ambra J., Ray P., An Evaluation of PLS Based Complex Models: The Roles of Power Analysis, Predictive Relevance and GOF Index, pp. 1-7, (2011); Alaeddin O., Altounjy R., Trust, technology awareness and satisfaction effect into the intention to use cryptocurrency among generation Z in Malaysia, International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 120, 2, pp. 7-10, (2018); Alonso, Crowdfunding in Islamic Finance and Microfinance: A Case Study of Egypt, Access to Finance and Human Development - Essays on Zakah, Awqaf and Microfinance, 1, pp. 85-94, (2015); Aqidah N., Mohd S., Palil R., Crowdfunding: a Collaborative Waqf Based Internet Platform, International Journal of Business, Economics and Law, 11, 5, pp. 41-46, (2016); Facilitating Equity Crowdfunding in the ASEAN Region, (2017); Auzzir Z., Haigh R., Amaratunga D., Impacts of Disaster to SMEs in Malaysia, Procedia Engineering, 212, pp. 1131-1138, (2018); Aziz M.A., Che Wan B.A., Platform Akaun Pelaburan - IAP Alternatif Baharu Usahawan Raih Teroka, Berita Harian, (2016); Aziz S., Md Husin M., Hussin N., Afaq Z., Factors that influence individuals' intentions to purchase family takaful mediating role of perceived trust, Asia Pacific Journal of Marketing and Logistics, 31, 1, pp. 81-104, (2019); Bagozzi R.P., Yi Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16, 1, pp. 74-94, (1988); Bakar N.A., Rosbi S., Robust Framework Diagnostics of Blockchain for Bitcoin Transaction System: A Technical Analysis from Islamic Financial Technology (i -FinTech) Perspective, International Journal of Business and Management, 2, 3, pp. 22-29, (2018); The State of Equity Crowdfunding: Equity Crowdfunding Insights and Analysis; World Fintech Report 2018, (2018); Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox Framework.

Traditional curricula of Finance had been built upon the framework of classic Economics, and this model started falling short providing qualified graduates to the financial workforce as the landscape changed. Financial Technology (FinTech) was the response, a newborn approach designed to address the gap. The curricula of conventional financial subjects lacked the practicality for studies, and the link between teaching and assessment needed revisiting. FinTech addresses the practicality and the link through carefully considering the transferability of applicable skills taught in education, Industry-Academia Collaboration, simply meaning to prepare students with practical skills that align with needs from the industry. This paper proposes a new curriculum model of FinTech based on the integration of teaching and talent needs from the finance industry. Practice is infused into the model, to which the step of corporation assessment of practice is introduced. This curriculum covers three parts, which are: 1) curriculum framework, 2) creativity of curriculum structure, and 3) assessment of practice. The subject construction and development of FinTech are discussed and elaborated from the above three perspectives. Curriculum development aims to create an educational environment where the needs from the industry are addressed and combined into the pedagogy. © 2019 ACM.","Curriculum Development; FinTech; Industry-Academia Collaboration","Education computing; Educational technology; Fintech; Students; Curriculum development; Curriculum models; Curriculum structure; Educational environment; Finance industries; Financial industry; Integrating information; Teaching and assessments; Curricula","","","","","","","Pollari I., Ruddenklau A., The pulse of fintech 2018-biannual global analysis of investment in fintech, KPMG International Cooperative, (2019); Pollari I., 2018 fintech100-leading global fintech innovators, KPMG International Cooperative, (2018); Minfeng L., Yangyang X., Research on the development strategy of financial technology industry-taking jiangsu province as an example [J/OL], Financial Theory and Practice, 2019, 4, pp. 32-41; Enlin T., Xiaoquan H., Finance teaching reform at in application-oriented colleges and universities under the background of sci-tech and finance integration and universities under the background of sci-tech and finance integration [J], Journal of Anqing Teachers College (Social Science Edition), 35, 3, pp. 154-157, (2016); Fangjiao S., The reform of financial education and talents development against the backdrop of the integration of technology and finance [J], Shanghai Finance, 2013, 8, pp. 113-114; Jiao L., Practice of the training mode of financial professionals in the era of internet plus [J], Journal of the Staff and Worker's University, 2019, 1, pp. 85-89; Yu X., Curriculum reform and construction of financial engineering under the background of financial science and technology [J], Education Modernization, 6, 10, pp. 91-93, (2019); Feng L., Li H., Research on the innovation strategy of financial professionals training in local colleges and universities from the perspective of financial science and technology [J], Education Modernization, 5, 48, pp. 5-7, (2018); Lili F., Bo Z., Innovative study of fully developed financial talents under the new era of financial technology [J], Journal of Hangzhou Finance Institute, 2018, 7, pp. 65-67; Jianjun L., Yongbin L., Thinking on the construction of internet finance course and talent training mode [J], China University Teaching, 2018, 5, pp. 64-68; Lu S., Yuqi S., Innovative research on the cultivation of financial professional under the background of fintech [J], Foreign Economic Relations & Trade, 2018, 10, pp. 136-137; Feng C., Industry-Academia Collaboration: The path of deepening and evolution [J], China Higher Education, Z2, pp. 13-16, (2018); Shihua N., Pin Y., Wenqi S., Domestic and foreign practice reference and enlightenment of industry-academia collaboration [J], Modern Enterprise Industry, 2016, 4, pp. 66-67; Minfeng Z., The new normal of economy, financial technology and the cultivation of financial professionals in local colleges and universities [J], Financial Theory and Teaching, 2018, 1, pp. 91-94; Hongman W., Exploration and research on the"" integration of curriculum and profession"" the cultivation of financial talents in independent colleges-taking the school of law and business of hubei university of economics as an example [J], Journal of Hubei University of Economics (Humanities and Social Sciences), 13, 11, pp. 209-210, (2016)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","2019 International Conference on Modern Educational Technology, ICMET 2019","28 June 2019 through 30 June 2019","Nanjing","150197","","978-145037222-0","","","English","ACM Int.

There are two types of fintech, i.e. card-based electronic wallet and application-based digital cash. The aim of this research is to rank the acceptance factors of e-wallet and digital cash by low income individuals. Initially, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to develop a structural hierarchy of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). It was followed by interviews with fintech experts to validate the structural hierarchy. Finally, AHP pairwise comparison questionnaires were filled out by 18 respondents, who have experiences using electronic wallet or digital cash. The results show that highest reception factor of both fintech types is ease of use. Speed is the second top rank acceptance factor of electronic wallet, whilst cost-benefit is the second factor of digital cash reception. These findings can enable fintech providers to improve their better marketing strategy, by enhancing their products related its ease of use, speed, and cost. © 2018 IEEE.","Acceptance factor; Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); Digital cash; Electronic transaction; Electronic wallet; Financial technology (fintech); Payment system; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","Analytic hierarchy process; Cost benefit analysis; Finance; Hierarchical systems; Marketing; Surveys; Wages; Acceptance factor; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Electronic transaction; Electronic wallet; Financial technology (fintech); Payment systems; Systematic literature review (SLR); Electronic money","","","","","Universitas Indonesia, UI","This study is funded by a PITTA Grant No. 1869/UN2.R3.1/HKP.05.00/2018 from the Universitas Indonesia.","Arango C.A., Hogg D., Lee A., Why is cash (still) so entrenched?

India, however, remain at a very low on the index of clean countries in the world. The causes for lack of proper hygienic conditions in India are many like poverty of the people, low level of literacy, cultural & religious customs of different groups etc. Due to the uncleanliness of the places, the Indian public is subjected to many diseases and discomforts. Even after seven decades of attaining independence, the situation has not changed for better. Realizing the importance of cleanliness in the country, the Government of India launched a special initiative called ``Swachha Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) under the aegis of Ministry of drinking water & sanitation on 2nd October, 2014 commemorating the birth day of the Father of the Nation. The campaign has attracted many stakeholders like State Governments, NGOs, Corporates of Public and Private sectors. The aim is to make India a clean country by 2019. This is the biggest behavioral change initiative taken by the Government in post independent era. ONGC, a Maharatna company and Numero Uno of public sector companies in India has also drawn numerous programmes in line with the mission of ``Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’’. (Clean India Campaign). It has been contributing generously towards the cause of Swachh Bharat through its fund meant for the Corporate Social Responsibility. ONGC has framed its own CSR and Sustainability Policy from 1st April, 2014. Around 30% of the CSR budget of ONGC, every year, is earmarked for ``Swachh Bharat’’ alone. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies using a new tech-nology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of tradi-tional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services. In Indonesia, Fin-tech has been widely developed since the past 3 years. Fin-tech faces a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts to new ways of living in modern digital tech-nology era. Basically, Fin-tech offers three main categories such as payment, personal finance, and financing. In financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding, and loan marketplace. All of these kinds of application have some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the use of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, Smartphone, massive use of data with the Big Data, connected objects, etc. The use of big data and those new technologies create new opportunities for these sectors, and this development also raises significant data protection concerns.

However, research on mechanisms, by which financial technology affects customer intention to use financial processes, is very fragmented. Thus, relying on process virtualization theory, we study the effect of financial technology implementation on intention to use via relationship, synchronism, and identification and control readiness of processes. The results of our conjoint experiment with 302 participants indicate that relationship, synchronism, and identification and control readiness jointly transmit the effect of financial technology implementation on customer intention to use financial processes. Our results further suggest that financial technology implementation generally increases customer intention to use financial processes. Our study integrates research on financial technology and process virtualization by explaining customer intention to use processes with financial technology through process readiness, and supports practitioners in addressing the needs of financial services customers. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

In this enhancement program, the FSA recommended that regional financial institutions introduce new financial products such as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and collateralized bond obligations (CBOs). However, this was left up to each institution's discretion rather than being mandatory. This resulted in a large difference in the introduction of new products. Therefore, this article has analysed what kinds of credit associations favourably increased the use of new financial products. As a result, it has been confirmed that the larger their lending shares and management scale and the better their business conditions are, the more positively they work on the introduction of new products. Considering the fact that relationships between financial institutions and enterprises tend to be fixed in Japan, this means that medium and small enterprises will have restrictions on the financial products they can use depending on the situation of their main banks. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","","Japan; credit provision; financial services; institutional framework; lending behavior; small and medium-sized enterprise","","","","","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS","This research is financially supported by the Grant-in-Aid from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Kakenhi).","Boot A.W.A., Relationship banking: What do we know?, Journal of Financial Intermediation, 9, pp. 7-25, (2000); Mach T.L., Wolken J.D., Financial services used by small businesses: Evidence from the 2003 survey of small business finances, Federal Reserve Bulletin, 92, (2006); Spiegel M.M., Yamori N., Determinants of Voluntary Bank Disclosure: Evidence From Japanese Shinkin Banks, In Japan's Great Stagnation: Financial and Monetary Policy Lessons For Advanced Economies (Cesifo Seminar), pp. 103-127, (2006); Yamori N., What types of small and medium-sized businesses are utilizing new financial products?, IBusiness, 1, pp. 106-112, (2009)","N.
