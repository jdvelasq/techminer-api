   .. note:: 
      A collaboration network is a generic co-occurrence network where the analized column
      is restricted to the following columns in the dataset:

      * Authors.

      * Institutions. 

      * Countries.

      As a consequence, many implemented plots and analysis are valid for analyzing a 
      co-occurrence network, including heat maps and other plot types.
