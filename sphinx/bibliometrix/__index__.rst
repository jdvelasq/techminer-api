In this section, the library's functionalities are presented in the structure used 
internally in Bibliometrix, in order to facilitate comparison. Likewise, functions have
been created with the same names as the Bibliometrix menus to facilitate the use of the
tool by users. It should be noted that the functions presented in this section cover only
a part of TechMiner's capabilities, and in this sense, Bibliometrix contains only a 
subset of the analytical capabilities of TechMiner.
