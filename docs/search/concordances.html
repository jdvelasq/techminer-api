<span class="go">EUROPES_ROAD to REGTECH has rested upon four apparently unrelated pillars: (1) extensive reporting requirements imposed after the global financial crisis to control SYSTEMIC_RISK and change in FINANCIAL_SECTOR_BEHAVIOUR.  the paper analyses these four pillars and suggests that together they are underpinning the development of a REGTECH_ECOSYSTEM in europe and will continue to do so.  we argue that the EUROPEAN_UNIONS FINANCIAL_SERVICES and DATA_PROTECTION_REGULATORY_REFORMS have unintentionally driven the use of REGULATORY_TECHNOLOGIES (REGTECH) by intermediaries, supervisors and regulators, and provided an environment within which REGTECH can flourish.  the experiences of europe in this process will provide insights for other societies in developing their own REGTECH ecosystems in order to support more efficient, stable, inclusive financial systems</span>
