**Thematic analysis**

This analysis is used to obtain and explore a representation of the documents
throught thematic clusters.

The implemented methodology is based on the Thematic Analysis of Elementary
Contexts implemented in T-LAB.

**Algorithm**

    1. Obtain the TF-IDF normalized matrix with rows scaled to unit length 
       using the Euclidean norm. Rows represent documents and columns represent
       keywords.

    2. Clustering the rows (cosine similarity).

    3. Build a table of keywords by clusters.

    4. Analyze the keywords by clusters.

    5. Visualization with n-1 clusters
