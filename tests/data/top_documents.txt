                 abstract : economic theory provides a unique vantage point from which to examine issues with respect to
                            emerging technologies, where standards and adoption, business process changes and
                            implementation outcomes, information security, investments and business value, and industry
                            impact require care and consideration on the part of senior management strategists and
                            financial services leaders.  in this article, we examine a new technology application which
                            is coming into its own around the world, in association with the revolution in wireless
                            connectivity: mobile payments.  although there are likely to be nuances and surprises with
                            this technology application, we caution the reader to recognize that many of the same
                            economic forces will be at work as were with other financial services and related technology
                            applications in the past.  we apply a robust evaluative framework that permits
                            identification of the relevant stakeholders and applicable theory in the analysis of
                            consumer, firm, business process, market, industrial and social issues.  our findings are
                            intended to guide senior managers in dealing with the economic aspects of mobile payments,
                            and to help identify some important directions for the research.

                 abstract : the financial services industry has been experiencing the recent emergence of new technology
                            innovations and process disruptions.  the industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are
                            looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer
                            experience, and approaches that result in services transformation.  industry and academic
                            observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes,
                            with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer
                            centricity, and informedness.  the long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not
                            able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the fintech revolution is at stake.  we
                            present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent
                            to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services.  we
                            discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology
                            innovations that have begun to leverage the execution and stakeholder value associated with
                            payments, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and cross-border payments; multiple innovations that
                            have affected lending and deposit services, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, and social media
                            use; issues with respect to investments, financial markets, trading, risk management, robo-
                            advisory and services influenced by blockchain and fintech innovations.  copyright

                 abstract : fintech brings about a new paradigm in which information technology is driving innovation in
                            the financial industry.  fintech is touted as a game changing, disruptive innovation capable
                            of shaking up traditional financial markets.  this article introduces a historical view of
                            fintech and discusses the ecosystem of the fintech sector.  we then discuss various fintech
                            business models and investment types.  this article illustrates the use of real options for
                            fintech investment decisions.  finally, technical and managerial challenges for both fintech
                            startups and traditional financial institutions are discussed.

                 abstract : since decades, the financial industry has experienced a continuous evolution in service
                            delivery due to digitalization.  this evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity
                            and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-
                            office processes.  recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from
                            improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business
                            opportunities and models for financial service companies.  digital finance encompasses a
                            magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and
                            novel forms of customer communication and interactiondelivered by fintech companies and
                            innovative financial service providers.  against this backdrop, the research on finance and
                            information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress
                            on the financial sector.  therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in
                            digital finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions.  moreover, it
                            gives an outlook on potential future research directions.  as a conceptual basis for
                            reviewing this field, the digital finance cube, which embraces three key dimensions of
                            digital finance and fintech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and
                            technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced.  this
                            conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of
                            digital finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other,
                            and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research.
