                 abstract : economic theory provides a unique vantage point from which to examine issues with respect to
                            emerging technologies, where standards and adoption, business process changes and
                            implementation outcomes, information security, investments and business value, and industry
                            impact require care and consideration on the part of senior management strategists and
                            financial services leaders.  in this article, we examine a new technology application which
                            is coming into its own around the world, in association with the revolution in wireless
                            connectivity: mobile payments.  although there are likely to be nuances and surprises with
                            this technology application, we caution the reader to recognize that many of the same
                            economic forces will be at work as were with other financial services and related technology
                            applications in the past.  we apply a robust evaluative framework that permits
                            identification of the relevant stakeholders and applicable theory in the analysis of
                            consumer, firm, business process, market, industrial and social issues.  our findings are
                            intended to guide senior managers in dealing with the economic aspects of mobile payments,
                            and to help identify some important directions for the research.

                 abstract : the financial services industry has been experiencing the recent emergence of new technology
                            innovations and process disruptions.  the industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are
                            looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer
                            experience, and approaches that result in services transformation.  industry and academic
                            observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes,
                            with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer
                            centricity, and informedness.  the long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not
                            able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the fintech revolution is at stake.  we
                            present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent
                            to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services.  we
                            discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology

                 abstract : since decades, the financial industry has experienced a continuous evolution in service
                            delivery due to digitalization.  this evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity
                            and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-
                            office processes.  recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from
                            improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business
                            opportunities and models for financial service companies.  digital finance encompasses a
                            magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and
                            novel forms of customer communication and interactiondelivered by fintech companies and
                            innovative financial service providers.  against this backdrop, the research on finance and
                            information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress
                            on the financial sector.  therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in
                            digital finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions.  moreover, it
                            gives an outlook on potential future research directions.  as a conceptual basis for

                            digital finance and fintech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and
                            technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced.  this
                            conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of
                            digital finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other,
                            and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research.

                 abstract : in this work, we provide the first comprehensive description of the initial coin offering
                            (ico) phenomenon, which by the end of 2017 allowed startups around the world to raise more
                            than $5.3 billion, according to market observers.  we analyze the determinants of the
                            success of these token offerings by considering a sample of 253 campaigns.  we find that the
                            probability of an ico's success is higher if the code source is available, when a token
                            presale is organized, and when tokens allow contributors to access a specific service (or to
                            share profits). our results provide valuable insights into this new source of capital for
                            businesses and into the key determinants of fundraising success.

                 abstract : this article provides a discussion on some issues associated with digital finance  an area
                            which has not been critically addressed in the literature.  digital finance and financial
                            inclusion has several benefits to financial services users, digital finance providers,
                            governments and the economy; notwithstanding, a number of issues still persist which if
                            addressed can make digital finance work better for individuals, businesses and governments.
                            the digital finance issues discussed in this article are relevant for the on-going debate

                 abstract : shadow bank market share in residential mortgage origination nearly doubled from 2007 to
                            2015, with particularly dramatic growth among online fintech lenders.  we study how two
                            forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth.
                            difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four
                            specific increases in regulatory burdencapital requirements, mortgage servicing rights,
                            mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to office of comptroller and
                            currency following closure of the office of thrift supervisionall reveal that traditional
                            banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks
                            partially filled these gaps.  relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more
                            creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market.  fintech lenders
                            charge a premium of 1416 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost
                            savings to borrowers.  they seem to use different information to set interest rates relative
                            to other lenders.  a quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation
                            accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%.

                 abstract : as a new term in the financial industry, fintech has become a popular term that describes
                            novel technologies adopted by the financial service institutions.  this term covers a large

                            this policy has remained controversial as many people believe that policy makers should

                 abstract : there is currently no consensus about what the term fintech means.  this paper explores the
                            complexity of fintech, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more
                            than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term fintech and covering a period of more than
                            40 years.  the objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as
                            succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application.  as the
                            origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the
                            definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of fintech using both spheres.
                            applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peerreviewed definitions
                            of the term, it is concluded that fintech is a new financial industry that applies
                            technology to improve financial activities.  the implications as well as the shortcomings of
                            this definition are discussed.

                 abstract : financial technology, or fintech, involves the design and delivery of financial products and
                            services through technology.  it impacts financial institutions, regulators, customers, and
                            merchants across a wide range of industries.  pervasive digital technologies are challenging
                            the fundamentals of the highly regulated financial sector, leading to the emergence of non-
                            traditional payment systems, peer-to-peer money exchanges and increased turbulence in
                            currency markets.  this case study explores the development of a fintech company in china
                            that offers microloans to college students.  five lessons learned are presented for
                            organizations to better manage the challenges and to leverage the opportunities amidst the
                            disruption of financial sector.  our findings also shed light on how digital technology 1)
                            offers the strategic capability for a firm to occupy a market niche in financial sector, 2)
                            enables the generation of alternative credit scores based on non-traditional data, and 3)
                            improves the financial inclusion of previously excluded market segments.

                 abstract : we investigate the economic and technological determinants inducing entrepreneurs to
                            establish ventures with the purpose of reinventing financial technology (fintech). we find
                            that countries witness more fintech startup formations when the economy is well-developed
                            and venture capital is readily available.  furthermore, the number of secure internet
                            servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, and the available labor force has a positive impact
                            on the development of this new market segment.  finally, the more difficult it is for
                            companies to access loans, the higher is the number of fintech startups in a country.
                            overall, the evidence suggests that fintech startup formation need not be left to chance,
                            but active policies can influence the emergence of this new sector.

                 abstract : regulatory change and technological developments following the 2008 global financial crisis
                            are changing the nature of financial markets, services, and institutions.  at the juncture
                            of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or regtechthe use of technology, particularly
                            information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance.
                            regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and
                            reliance on regtech.  whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability,
                            prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market
                            competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate.
                            regtech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the
                            reconceptualization of financial regulation.  regtech to date has focused on the
                            digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes.  this offers tremendous cost
                            savings to the financial services industry and regulators.  however, the potential of
                            regtech is far greater  it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate
                            regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient
                            regulatory compliance.  we argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be
                            captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation.  this
                            paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial
                            world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of regtech, and proposes sequenced
                            reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector
                            and other industries.

                 abstract : the rapid development of information and communications technology is transforming the
                            entire industry landscape, heralding a new era of convergence services.  as one of the
                            developing countries in the financial sector, china is experiencing an unprecedented level
                            of convergence between finance and technology.  this study applies the lens of actor-network
                            theory (ant) to conduct a multi-level analysis of the historical development of china's
                            financial technology (fintech) industry.  it attempts to elucidate the process of building
                            and disrupting a variety of networks comprising heterogeneous actors involved in the newly
                            emerging convergence industry.  this research represents a stepping stone in exploring the
                            interaction between fintech and its yet unfolding social and political context.  it also
                            discusses policy implications for china's fintech industry, focusing on the changing role of
                            the state in fostering the growth of national industry within and outside of china.

                 pub_year : 2018
                 abstract : the purpose of this paper is to develop an insight and review the effect of fintech
                            development against the broader environment in financial technology.  we further aim to
                            offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of
                            fintech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem.  by drawing upon very
                            recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for
                            financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the
                            global banking and regulatory system.  it is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the
                            development, the current state, and possible future of fintech.  this paper attempts to
                            connect practitioner-led and academic research.  while it draws on academic research, the
                            perspective it takes is also practice-oriented.  it relies on the current academic
                            literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly
                            available commentaries.  it also draws on professional practitioners roundtable discussions,
                            and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant.  we attempt to interpret
                            banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective.  the last crisis exposed
                            significant failures in regulation and supervision.  it has made the financial market law
                            and compliance a key topic on the current agenda.  disruptive technological change also
                            seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change.  we
                            contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new
                            entrants where this has also practical implications.  we also provide for an updated review
                            of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within
                            the financial services domain.  the aim here is to assist market participants to improve
                            effectiveness and collaboration.  the difficulties arising from extensive regulation may
                            suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation.  disruptive
                            innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory
                            gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry.  it becomes even
                            more important as the financial services industry evolves.  for example, the preparedness of
                            the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with
                            regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes.  such results range from achieving an
                            orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence
                            in the financial system.  our action-led research results have implications for both
                            research and practice.  these should be of interest to regulatory standard setters,
                            investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory
                            and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts.
                            as a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers,
                            entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative
                            financial services domain.  it is also of interest to bankers who might consider fintech and
                            strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1

                            included in fintech are innovations in payment systems (including cryptocurrencies), credit
                            markets (including p2p lending), and insurance, with blockchain-assisted smart contracts
                            playing a role.  the paper provides a definition of fintech, examines some statistics and
                            stylized facts, and then reviews the theoretical and empirical literature.  the review is
                            organized around four main research questions.  the paper summarizes our knowledge on these
                            questions and concludes with questions for future research.

              source_name : INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENGINEERING RESEARCH
                 pub_year : 2016
                 abstract : this paper examined the acceptance of payment-type fintech services of users by utilizing
                            the elaboration likelihood model by petty and cacioppo [1] and by applying variables
                            associated with the technology acceptance model.  in addition, it analyzed the causal
                            relationship between concern for information privacy and self-efficacy by adopting them as
                            moderating variables.  results suggested that usefulness, ease of use and credibility had an
                            effect on intention to use, and self-efficacy was found to have an moderating effect on
                            independent and dependent variables.  further, concern for information privacy was found to
                            be a factor obstructing the path to intention to use.  the implications of this study are
                            that in the promotion of payment-type fintech services, convenience and usefulness are the
                            most critical and influential variables in terms of usage, while government deregulation and
                            stronger security are called for from an institutional aspect.

                 abstract : we provide large-scale evidence on the occurrence and value of fintech innovation.  using
                            data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify
                            innovations by their underlying technologies.  we find that most fintech innovations yield
                            substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable.  for the
                            overall financial sector, internet of things (iot), robo-advising, and blockchain are the
                            most valuable innovation types.  innovations affect financial industries more negatively
                            when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders
                            that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

                 abstract : although the fintech subject has been widely discussed in the press and communications
                            media, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of the term in the scientific
                            literature and the key research topics and trends.  aiming to narrow this gap, the objective
                            of this study is to investigate the concept of fintech, to map the literature and point out
                            new routes and opportunities in the field.  for this purpose, a systematic literature review
                            (slr) is performed, attempting to describe the areas of fintech activities, propose a
                            categorization for this literature, highlight the main issues dealt with to date in the
                            sample publications, as well as to point out new questions for continuing research in this
                            field.  the results show a set of definitions for the term fintech and suggest as a
                            comprehensive understanding of fintech, as innovative companies active in the financial
                            industry making use of the availability of communication, the ubiquity of the internet, and
                            the automated processing of information.  moreover, the literature focuses on financial
                            services and innovations, dealing with issues of financial industry regulation and local
                            legislation or the financial system globally.  the innovation of research subcategories
                            (technology adoption/network externalities), blockchain and security appear with great
                            emphasis in this work and represent the current most sensitive aspects also linked to the
                            more global theme of digital transformation.  finally, subjects related to financial
                            services operation particularly deal with risks of financial loss related to different
                            factors involved in the business environment of these organizations.

                 abstract : two billion people in developing economies have limited or no access to formal financial
                            services, creating cause for substantial research interest in financial inclusion as a
                            complex multidimensional phenomenon.  digital finance technologies, including blockchain,
                            have empowered a type of crescive entrepreneurship that seeks opportunities in relation to
                            financially excluded individuals.  this article hypothesizes that nonmonetary causal factors
                            and informal financial practices play a major role in habits of the financially excluded,
                            which would favor blockchain's disintermediation features over the incumbent approach.

                            formal bank account, i prescribe five sensitivities that blockchain entrepreneurs need to
                            consider when targeting this segment.  the value of this article's approach extends well
                            beyond traditional unisystemic views for financial inclusion, as blockchain-based
                            entrepreneurial opportunities emerge to reveal alternative forms of disintermediated
                            financial services, which we exemplify in startups modeling informal practices.  blockchain
                            entrepreneurship can generate semi-formal financial services that bring financial
                            aspirations closer to people.  my perspective is relevant to blockchain entrepreneurs who
                            aim to understand the practices of the unbanked as source information for the development of
                            innovative solutions.

                 abstract : the financial sector is facing radical transformation.  leveraging digital technologies to
                            offer innovative services, fintech start-ups are emerging in domains such as asset
                            management, lending, or insurance.  despite increasing investments, the fintech phenomenon
                            is low on theoretical insights.  so far, the offerings of fintech start-ups have been
                            predominantly investigated from a functional perspective.  as a functional perspective does
                            not suffice to fully understand the offerings of fintech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of
                            non-functional characteristics.  thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented
                            fintech start-ups.  our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along the perspectives
                            interaction, data, and monetization.  we demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy by
                            classifying the offerings of 227 fintech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a
                            cluster analysis.  our taxonomy contributes to the descriptive knowledge on fintech start-
                            ups, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze the service offerings of fintech
                            start-up in a structured manner.

         global_citations : 65
              source_name : ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
                 pub_year : 2018
                 abstract : based on a systematic review of influential publications among 402 papers published between
                            2010 and 2018, this paper identifies gaps in economics and finance research regarding two
                            applications of fintech: crowdfunding and blockchain.  analysing these records shows that
                            (i) current research on fintech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii)
                            crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional
                            financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for
                            traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating
                            the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new
                            intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to
                            eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all.

                 pub_year : 2019
                 abstract : purpose: considering the increasing impact of artificial intelligence (ai) on financial
                            technology (fintech), the purpose of this paper is to propose a research framework to better
                            understand robo-advisor adoption by a wide range of potential customers.  it also predicts
                            that personal and sociodemographic variables (familiarity with robots, age, gender and
                            country) moderate the main relationships.  design/methodology/approach: data from a web
                            survey of 765 north american, british and portuguese potential users of robo-advisor
                            services confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for structural
                            equation modeling and multisample analyses of the hypotheses.  findings: consumers attitudes
                            toward robo-advisors, together with mass media and interpersonal subjective norms, are found
                            to be the key determinants of adoption.  the influences of perceived usefulness and attitude
                            are slightly higher for users with a higher level of familiarity with robots; in turn,
                            subjective norms are significantly more relevant for users with a lower familiarity and for
                            customers from anglo-saxon countries.  practical implications: banks and other firms in the
                            finance industry should design robo-advisors to be used by a wide spectrum of consumers.
                            marketing tactics applied should consider the customers level of familiarity with robots.
                            originality/value: this research identifies the key drivers of robo-advisor adoption and the
                            moderating effect of personal and sociodemographic variables.  it contributes to
                            understanding consumers perceptions regarding the introduction of ai in fintech.

                 pub_year : 2018
                 abstract : the emergence of financial technology around the globe is driven by efforts to deconstruct
                            and reimagine business models embedded within financial services.  entrepreneurial
                            endeavours to this end are diverse.  indeed, the propensity toward complexity is
                            considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry
                            participants, infrastructures, and technologies.  this study aims to improve comprehension
                            of the global fintech landscape.  it is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated
                            in swift's innotribe competition.  we used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up
                            firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the
                            structure of the fintech landscape.  the main findings of this work are: (1) the development
                            of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying
                            component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs
                            synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through
                            competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access,
                            financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies
                            for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were
                            identified.  collectively, our results offer new insights into the diversity and range of
                            emergent innovations and technologies that q2 are transforming the financial services
                            industry worldwide.  copyright

                 abstract : blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, is an emerging financial technology (fintech)
                            that is poised to have strategic impacts on organizations.  because it is a new phenomenon,
                            there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the
                            technology's potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization
                            remains unknown.  our study intends to fill that gap.  using affordance-actualization (a-a)
                            theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an
                            organization that has effectively implemented it.  we identify three affordances of
                            blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized.
                            the process model extends a-a theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchain's
                            use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual
                            adaptation and constraint mitigation.  our study makes important theoretical contributions
                            to the literature on a-a theory, blockchain, information technology (it) implementation, and
                            strategic information systems (sis). our study can also help it practitioners to implement
                            blockchain effectively and extract value from their investment.

              source_name : ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A
                 pub_year : 2017
                 abstract : crowdfunding is a method of raising money and finance to capitalize projects of various
                            kinds.  drawing on the networking capabilities of the internet and software platforms, those
                            seeking project funding appeal to potentially diverse audiences who are collectively
                            referred to as the crowd.  what practitioners, advocates and policymakers typically identify
                            within crowdfunding is its alternative, disruptive and democratizing qualities; that is, it
                            is held to be a novel, digitally rendered economic space which has the capacity to challenge
                            established funding practices in banking, capital markets and venture capital networks,
                            offering a more open and egalitarian source of capital for economic, social and cultural
                            entrepreneurship.  the paper develops the concept of ecologies, drawn from the geographies
                            of money and finance literature, to advance a critical understanding of the crowdfunding
                            economy that is sceptical of its apparent qualities.  first, by encouraging the analysis of
                            diverse and proliferative monetary and financial forms, the concept of ecologies enables an
                            understanding that avoids the binary opposition of capitalist/alternative economic forms and
                            which differentiates between the variegated crowdfunding ecologies that have emerged to
                            date.  second, by foregrounding the intermediation processes and creditdebt relations of
                            monetary and financial ecologies, it is argued that crowdfunding may largely replicate
                            rather than disrupt the extant institutional and debt dynamics of funding practices.  third,
                            by emphasizing the socio-spatial effects of monetary and financial ecologies, attention is
                            drawn to the need for further research into the unevenness that mitigates against
                            crowdfunding being as open and egalitarian as its advocates claim.

                 abstract : fintech is about the introduction of new technologies into the financial sector, and it is
                            now revolutionizing the financial industry.  in 2017, when the academic finance community
                            was not actively researching fintech, the editorial team of the review of financial studies
                            launched a competition to develop research proposals focused on this topic.  this special
                            issue is the result.  in this introductory article, we describe the recent fintech
                            phenomenon and the novel editorial protocol employed for this special issue following the
                            registered reports format.we discuss what we learned from the submitted proposals about the
                            field of fintech and which ones we selected to be completed and ultimately come out in this
                            special issue.  we also provide several observations to help guide future research in the
                            emerging area of fintech.  (jel g00, g21, g23, g28, l51, o31).

                 pub_year : 2017
                 abstract : an analysis of some of the recent blockchain networks is presented to determine if they
                            satisfy metcalfe's law, as has been shown for some online social media networks.  the value
                            of the network was modeled based on the price of the digital currency in use on the network,
                            and the number of users by the number of unique addresses each day that engage in
                            transactions on the network.  the bitcoin, ethereum, and dash networks were analyzed.  the
                            analysis shows that the networks were fairly well modeled by metcalfe's law, which
                            identifies the value of a network as proportional to the square of the number of its nodes,
                            or end users.  a new network model was also presented that shows the value to be
                            proportional to the exponential of the root of the number of users participating in the
                            network, and shows good agreement as well.  conditions for determining critical mass based
                            on the new model were also presented.  finally, the potential for identifying value bubbles
                            that can be spotted as deviations in value from the model was discussed and illustrated
                            using the data from one of the networks.  those value bubbles show up where repeated
                            extremely high value increases are not accompanied by any commensurate increase in the
                            number of participating users, or any other development that could give rise to the higher
                            value.

                 abstract : purpose: the purpose of this paper is to better understand why people are willing or
                            hesitant to use financial technology (fintech) as well as to determine whether the effect of
                            perceived benefits and risks of continuance intention differs depending on user types.
                            design/methodology/approach: original data were collected via a survey of 243 participants
                            with fintech usage experience.  the partial least squares method was used to test the
                            proposed model.  findings: the results reveal that legal risk had the most negative effect
                            on the fintech continuance intention, while convenience had the strongest positive effect.
                            differences in specific benefit and risk impacts are found between early and late adopters.
                            originality/value: this empirical study contributes to the novel understanding of the
                            benefit and risk factors affecting the fintech continuance intention.

                 pub_year : 2020
                 abstract : blockchain technology can reduce transaction costs, generate distributed trust, and empower
                            decentralized platforms, potentially becoming a new foundation for decentralized business
                            models.  in the financial industry, blockchain technology allows for the rise of
                            decentralized financial services, which tend to be more decentralized, innovative,
                            interoperable, borderless, and transparent.  empowered by blockchain technology,
                            decentralized financial services have the potential to broaden financial inclusion,
                            facilitate open access, encourage permissionless innovation, and create new opportunities
                            for entrepreneurs and innovators.  in this article, we assess the benefits of decentralized
                            finance, identify existing business models, and evaluate potential challenges and limits.
                            as a new area of financial technology, decentralized finance may reshape the structure of
                            modern finance and create a new landscape for entrepreneurship and innovation, showcasing
                            the promises and challenges of decentralized business models.

                 abstract : this paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap in the existing literature on bitcoin,
                            blockchain and fintech.  it begins by clarifying the definition of these concepts.  through
                            a systematic review and case studies in the supply chain industry, this paper brings out the
                            applications, the benefits/value, and the challenges/issues of bitcoin, blockchain and
                            fintech in several industries.  it also presents the research methodologies/approaches used
                            during such research.  the classification framework developed and used to perform an
                            analysis of 141 articles from five top academic databases serves as a baseline study.  it
                            offers the opportunity to evaluate the level of knowledge on bitcoin, blockchain and
                            fintech, and their evolution over time.  the findings show that these technologies are
                            evolving, and organizations are embracing them for competitive advantage.  thus,
                            organizations need to leverage research on these technologies to better understand them,
                            optimize their business strategies, and develop critical insights for decision-making.

         global_citations : 49
              source_name : BRITISH ACCOUNTING REVIEW
                 pub_year : 2020
                 abstract : many papers in recent years have examined the benefits of adding alternative assets to
                            traditional portfolios containing stocks and bonds.  bitcoin has emerged as a new
                            alternative investment for investors which has attracted much attention from the media and
                            investors alike.  however relatively little is known about the investment benefits of
                            bitcoin and therefore this paper examines the benefit of including bitcoin in a traditional
                            benchmark portfolio of stocks and bonds.  specially, we employ data up to june 2018 and
                            analyse the potential out-of-sample portfolio benefits resulting from including bitcoin in a
                            stock-bond portfolio for a range of eight popular asset allocation strategies.  the out-of-
                            sample analysis shows that, across all different asset allocation strategies and risk
                            aversions, the benefits of bitcoin are quite considerable with substantially higher risk-
                            adjusted returns.  our results are robust to rolling estimation windows, the incorporation
                            of transaction costs, the inclusion of a commodity portfolio, alternative indices, short-
                            selling as well as two additional optimization techniques including higher moments with (and
                            without) variance-based constraints (vbcs). therefore, our results suggest that investors
                            should include bitcoin in their portfolio as it generates substantial higher risk-adjusted
                            returns.

                 abstract : fintech has been playing an increasing role in shaping financial and banking landscapes.  in
                            this paper, we use account-level data from lendingclub and y-14m data reported by u.s.
                            banks with assets over $50 billion to examine whether the fintech lending platform could
                            expand credit access to consumers.  we find that lendingclub's consumer lending activities
                            have penetrated areas that may be underserved by traditional banks, such as in highly
                            concentrated markets and areas that have fewer bank branches per capita.  we also find that
                            the portion of lendingclub loans increases in areas where the local economy is not
                            performing well.

                 abstract : fintech, the word which originates from marriage of "finance" and "technology", designates
                            currently a novel, innovative and emerging field which attracts attention from the
                            publicity.  at the moment there is no universal understanding and definition of fintech in
                            the research, however, the topic is widely addressed by the english- and german-speaking
                            press.  in this study we aim to make insights into how the press and other popular media
                            understand and frame fintech, discussing definitions that represents the meaning of it for
                            the press, and deliver the conceptual framework to be used in research and scientific
                            literature.  in doing so, we also identify drivers of fintech and put them in the context of
                            financial and digital innovation research.  thereby, we provide objective understanding of

                 abstract : investors have always been interested in stock price forecasting.  since the development of
                            electronic media, hundreds pieces of financial news are released on different media every
                            day.  numerous studies have attempted to examine whether the stock price forecasting through
                            text mining technology and machine learning could lead to abnormal returns.  however, few of
                            them involved the discussion on whether using different media could affect forecasting
                            results.  financial sentiment analysis is an important research area of financial technology
                            (fintech). this research focuses on investigating the influence of using different financial
                            resources to investment and how to improve the accuracy of forecasting through deep
                            learning.  the experimental result shows various financial resources have significantly
                            different effects to investors and their investments, while the accuracy of news
                            categorization could be improved through deep learning.

                 abstract : mobile phones have provided such an enormous opportunity for financial development, and are
                            anticipated to become a common tool for carrying out various financial transactions.
                            hundreds of mobile payment services have been introduced across the globe.  strikingly, many
                            of these efforts have failed.  this study analyzes whether mobile payment is still relevant
                            in the fintech era.  i compare three mobile payment projects  oi paggo in brazil, tcash in
                            indonesia, and m-pesa in kenya  as case studies.  i argue that mobile payment systems
                            currently operate in such complex and multidimensional networks with shared common
                            infrastructures and compete for producing and providing value to the customers on the basis
                            of these infrastructures.  three attributes of industry and network structure are
                            immediately of interest: (1) cutting the vertical supply chain more finely may encourage
                            large players to extend their domination, (2) the basic platform continues to be governed by
                            multinational operators (mnos)  telecom firms, and (3) openness may be decreasing or
                            increasing even as the number of independent parties in the supply chain drops.

                 pub_year : 2018
                 abstract : the financial crisis of 2008 has led to dramatic changes in the way that finance is
                            regulated: the dodd-frank act imposed broad and systemic regulation on the industry on a
                            level not seen since the new deal.  but the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the
                            crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how
                            they are provided.  regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial
                            technology (or "fintech") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a
                            variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even
                            to the very form of money itself.  these changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization
                            of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance.  in particular, this
                            article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with "too big to
                            fail" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small,
                            decentralized financial markets.  in many ways, these risks can be greater than those
                            presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to
                            adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage
                            excessively risky behavior by market participants.  the article concludes by sketching out a
                            variety of regulatory responses that better correspond to fintech's particular risks and
                            rewards.

                 abstract : along with the development of fintech, many scholars have studied how information technology
                            is applied to financial services with a focus on extended methods for application.  few
                            scholars have studied the influence mechanism behind the adoption of fintech services.  this
                            paper proposes an improved technology acceptance model (tam) that incorporates user
                            innovativeness, government support, brand image, and perceived risk as determinants of trust
                            to investigate how users adopt fintech services.  we designed a questionnaire, sent it to
                            active customers of the hefei science and technology rural commercial bank, and obtained 387
                            eligible responses.  we analyzed the data with a structural equation model (sem) to test the
                            hypotheses, including the relationships of all latent variables.  the results reveal that
                            users' trust in fintech services has a very significant influence on users' attitudes for
                            adoption.  in addition, perceived ease of use and perceived risk does not affect users'
                            attitudes toward the adoption regarding fintech services.  this study contributes to the
                            literature of the adoption of fintech services by providing a more comprehensive view of the
                            determinants of users' attitudes by combining trust of fintech services with tam.

                 abstract : the financial industry has been strongly influenced by digitalization in the past few years
                            reflected by the emergence of fintech, which represents the marriage of finance and
                            information technology.  fintech provides opportunities for the creation of new services and
                            business models and poses challenges to traditional financial service providers.  therefore,
                            fintech has become a subject of debate among practitioners, investors, and researchers and
                            is highly visible in the popular media.  in this study, we unveil the drivers motivating the
                            fintech phenomenon perceived by the english and german popular press including the subjects
                            discussed in the context of fintech.  this study is the first one to reflect the media
                            perspective on the fintech phenomenon in the research.  in doing so, we extend the growing
                            knowledge on fintech and contribute to a common understanding in the financial and digital
                            innovation literature.  these study contributes to research in the areas of information
                            systems, finance and interdisciplinary social sciences.  moreover, it brings value to
                            practitioners (entrepreneurs, investors, regulators, etc.), who explore the field of
                            fintech.
