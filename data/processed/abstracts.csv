2019-0011,2,we find that the fintech industry has a stronger effect on production inducement.,12,"Shin YJ et al, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY"

2019-0011,4,this implies that the fintech industry is effective as the intermediate good with national demand as well as the final good.,12,"Shin YJ et al, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY"
2019-0011,5,"particularly, this industry plays the roles of intermediate and final goods across almost all industries.",12,"Shin YJ et al, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY"
2019-0011,6,"that is, fintech could better promote overall national economic performance as a platform industry.",12,"Shin YJ et al, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY"

2019-0010,0,this article interrogates recent policy pronouncements around the promotion of emerging financial technologies (fintech) as means of enabling financial inclusion.,12,"Bernards N et al, 2019, ENVIRON PLANN A"
2019-0010,1,it is argued that situating this emergent turn to technology in the context of a longer-running pattern of failed efforts to promote the development of financial markets for the poor in the global south offers us a useful lens on the dynamics of neoliberalism.,12,"Bernards N et al, 2019, ENVIRON PLANN A"
2019-0010,2,"the article develops this analysis by drawing together interlinked discussions of neoliberal reason, highlighting the central role played by the diffusion of market institutions in neoliberal projects with marxian discussions highlighting the crucial underlying role of labour in enabling the operation of markets.",12,"Bernards N et al, 2019, ENVIRON PLANN A"
2019-0010,3,"in this context the appeal to ever-more fine-grained information with which to allocate credit underlying the turn to technology can both be read as yet another attempt to re-engineer the market, and also seen as a doomed project.",12,"Bernards N et al, 2019, ENVIRON PLANN A"

2019-0006,3,"drawing on engagements with science and technology studies and historical materialist political economy, this article advances an approach emphasizing processes of abstraction from productive activities, mediated through particular infrastructures, as core elements of financial accumulation.",23,"Bernards N et al, 2019, REV INT POLIT ECON"
2019-0006,4,"seen in this light, psychometrics in particular and alternative credit data more broadly can be seen as flawed efforts to confront three sets of limits(1) the necessarily reductive character of abstract framings, and the consequent challenges posed by their encounter with complex processes in practice, (2) the ways that systems for credit scoring interact with the infrastructures of existing financial systems, and (3) the difficulty of realizing financial profits in the context of widespread precarious livelihoods.",23,"Bernards N et al, 2019, REV INT POLIT ECON"
