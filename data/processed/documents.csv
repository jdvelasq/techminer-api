Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University","we study the personal credit market using unique individual-level data covering fintech and traditional lenders. we show that fintech lenders acquire market share by lending first to higher-risk borrowers and then to safer borrowers, and rely mainly on hard information to make credit decisions. fintech borrowers are significantly more likely to default than neighbor individuals with the same characteristics borrowing from traditional financial institutions. furthermore, they tend to experience a short-lived reduction in the cost of credit, because their indebtedness increases more than non-fintech borrowers after loan origination. however, fintech lenders' pricing strategies are likely to take this into account.

Ukwueze FO,57195069100,Cryptocurrency: Towards regulating the unruly enigma of fintech in Nigeria and South Africa,2021,POTCHEFSTROOM ELECTRONIC LAW JOURNAL,24,,0,10.17159/1727-3781/2021/V24I0A10743,"University of Nigeria, Nigeria","one of the most modern inventions of financial technology (fintech) since after the global financial crisis of 2008 is the crypto or virtual currency/asset. since the creation of the first cryptocurrency, the bitcoin, in 2009, it is estimated that over five thousand variants of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged. virtual currencies have become widespread across the globe but their legal status and uses in various countries have remained uncertain. they have been variously classified as currencies, securities, properties, assets, commodities and tokens, and used as means of exchange but are not legally recognised as legal tender. in many jurisdictions their emergence was greeted with scepticism and express or tacit rejection by financial and securities markets regulators, but over time, owing to their increasing popularity, characteristics, positive and negative potentials, there has been a gradual shift towards their formal recognition and regulation. regulatory authorities in many countries are now grappling with designing appropriate policy and regulatory framework for the crypto phenomenon. this paper interrogates the current legal status and efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies in two leading african nations, nigeria and south africa, and highlights the challenges of designing an appropriate regulatory framework for this enigmatic technology. the paper adopts the doctrinal legal research methodology, employing the descriptive, analytical, and comparative approaches. it follows a structured review and analysis of relevant extant legislation on currencies and securities in the countries to ascertain whether they cover cryptocurrencies. it then compares the current position of the law on the subject in the two countries. bearing in mind that it may not be possible to totally ban dealing in cryptocurrencies, the paper concludes that regulation has become imperative. drawing from the position on the subject in more developed nations, the united states of america (us) and the european union (eu), this paper proposes a model of regulation of virtual currency not only for nigeria and south africa but also for other african countries.

Fahy L,57262658300,Regulator Reputation and Stakeholder Participation: A Case Study of the UK's Regulatory Sandbox for Fintech,2021,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION,,,0,10.1017/ERR.2021.44,"Utrecht School of Governance, Utrecht University, Bijlhouwerstraat 6-8, ZC Utrecht, 3511, Netherlands","this article contributes to the discussion about managing the risks and uncertainties of emerging technologies through increased stakeholder participation. authorities have increasingly invited stakeholders from high-technology sectors to participate in assessing the risks of, and designing responses to, new technologies. yet authorities often struggle to attract stakeholders from such sectors to participate; a critical challenge identified but still undertheorised in the literature. responding to this gap, this article presents a case study of the uk's regulatory sandbox for financial technologies, applying a document study, questionnaire and interviews to explore fintech firm motivations and apprehensions about participation. drawing on the bureaucratic reputation literature, the study finds that fintech firms have a range of practical, reputational and normative motivations to participate, and these motivations are inextricably tied to the regulator's strong reputation with the sector as procedurally correct, high-performing and morally committed to facilitating innovation. on this basis, recommendations for practitioners and hypotheses for future research into the drivers of stakeholder participation in regulatory decision-making surrounding emerging technologies are proposed.

income and reducing cost by facilitating the benefits enabled by iot-fintech technology. to do so, some of the challenging problems that mainly related to routing protocols in such highly dynamic, unreliable (due to mobility) and widely distributed network need to be carefully addressed. this paper therefore focuses on developing a new trustworthy and efficient routing mechanism to be used in routing data traffic over iot-fintech mobile networks. a new non-linear l&#x00e9;vy brownian generalized normal distribution optimization (nlbgndo) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of finding an optimal path from source to destination sensor nodes to be used in forwarding fintech&#x2019;s related data. we also propose an objective function to be used in maintaining trustworthiness of the selected relay-node candidates by introducing a trust-based friendship mechanism to be measured and applied during each selection process. the formulated model also considering node&#x2019;s residual energy, experienced response time, and inter-node distance (to figure out density/sparsity ratio of sensor nodes). results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism could maintain very wise and efficient decisions over the selection period in comparison with other methods. iee",fintech;

Ringe W-G; Ruof C,35622501100;57219516334,Regulating fintech in the EU: The case for a guided sandbox,2020,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION,11,604.0,3,10.1017/ERR.2020.8,"University of Hamburg, Institute of Law and Economics, Germany","new financial technology holds the promise of innovation and competition, challenging established products and services and frequently improving market processes. however, regulation of these new services faces a double challenge: to keep pace with innovation and facilitate new market entries while at the same time understanding and managing the regulatory risks that are involved. at this stage, the existing eu regulatory framework is of little help: the bulk of the present body of financial regulation stems from a different time, with different regulatory problems in mind. eu regulation is also very slow to change and to adapt. therefore, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox""- an experimentation space - as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive. a sandbox would allow market participants to test fintech services in the real market, with real consumers, but under the close scrutiny of the supervisor. the benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market""cycle of financial innovation, while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection. at the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a technical field which is sometimes poorly understood, both for firms and for the regulator. this would help to reduce the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants. in the particular eu legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward. in this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the eu member states, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by eu institutions. this innovative approach would be somewhat uncharted territory for the eu, and thereby also contribute to the future development of eu financial market governance as a whole.

Omarova ST,36952224400,Technology v Technocracy: Fintech as a Regulatory Challenge,2020,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REGULATION,6,75.0,3,10.1093/JFR/FJAA004,,"this article examines fintech as a systemic force disrupting the currently dominant technocratic paradigm of financial regulation. it offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the key fintech-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and (ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of the regulatory enterprise as it exists today. this exercise reveals the fundamental tension at the core of the fintech problem. in the fintech era, the financial system as a whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and difficult to manage. the emerging regulatory responses to these macro-level changes, however, continue to operate primarily on the micro-level. surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate fintech, this article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design. against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of the fintech challenge- a nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively unified manner.

Rupeika-Apoga R; Thalassinos EI,57191521370;25636208400,Ideas for a regulatory definition of FinTech,2020,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,8,136.0,2,10.35808/IJEBA/448,"University of Latvia, Latvia; University of Piraeus, Greece","purpose: the aim of the paper is to develop the approach to a legal definition of fintech. design/methodology/approach: in this paper we evolve possible approaches of fintech legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels. document analysis, as a form of qualitative research, was used in this study. findings: we found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address fintech companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and fintech operators. in our opinion, no specific legislation for fintech companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc. practical implications: the term fintech is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally. according to international organizations such as the imf, the world bank and the oecd, fintech offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries. some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for fintech and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment. originality/value: there is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of fintech among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area. the value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of fintech by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way.

Bernards N,56750052300,"The poverty of fintech? Psychometrics, credit infrastructures, and the limits of financialization",2019,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY,26,815.0,23,10.1080/09692290.2019.1597753,"University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom","it is increasingly common to claim that innovative financial technologies (fintech) will enable ever-wider access to credit. previous critical accounts have often linked the development of fintech to processes of financialization. however, these arguments rarely take account of the uneven and highly limited character of financial inclusion in practice. drawing on engagements with science and technology studies and historical materialist political economy, this article advances an approach emphasizing processes of abstraction from productive activities, mediated through particular infrastructures, as core elements of financial accumulation. seen in this light, psychometrics in particular and alternative credit data more broadly can be seen as flawed efforts to confront three sets of limits(1) the necessarily reductive character of abstract framings, and the consequent challenges posed by their encounter with complex processes in practice, (2) the ways that systems for credit scoring interact with the infrastructures of existing financial systems, and (3) the difficulty of realizing financial profits in the context of widespread precarious livelihoods. looking at alternative forms of credit data from this angle offers a way of grasping the truncated and uneven rollout of fintech, and hence of prompting more critical reflections about the limits to processes of financialization.

Brownsword R,8262815900,"Regulatory Fitness: Fintech, Funny Money, and Smart Contracts",2019,EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW,20,5.0,7,10.1007/S40804-019-00134-2,"Professor in Law, Kings College London, London, United Kingdom; Professor in Law, Bournemouth University, Bournemouth, United Kingdom","this article argues that there are many questions that lawyers might ask, and conversations that they might have, about smart contracts; that some questions that are asked are more important than others; and that there are some questions that are not asked but which should be asked. first, it is argued that the question that preoccupies coherentists (concerning the application of the law of contract to smart contracts, and the fit between smart contracts and the paradigmatic fiat contracts that are recognised by the law of contract) is neither as puzzling nor as important as might be supposed. secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a regulatory-instrumentalist nature; in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set. thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had. blockchain is a potentially transformative technology and it is important to have more fundamental conversations about the kind of community that we want to be.

""if it works here, it works everywhere"" approach may have a serious downside when it comes to execution stage. from definition of the service to areas of application, to formation of the company and background of the investors, the ever-dictating financial sector regulations change dramatically from one country to another. as in the example of popular payment provider paypal, failing to keep primary systems domestically may lead to a rejection of license application from brsa (banking regulation and supervision agency) [1] another example of such regulations is the need to do due diligence and monitor suspicious customer activity for aml/ctf purposes for some fintechs in payment industry. such requirements can be daunting for a technology-oriented point of view, and many of these companies face these facts at a later stage when they try to coexist or collaborate with other financial institutions. as these requirements may alter operational costs, human resources, and even it infrastructure, they struggle to find investment or sign contracts with financial institutions. this study covers both successful and unsuccessful fintech projects in payments and their position against regulations and offer remediations for better acceptance within turkish financial sector.

Anagnostopoulos I,56394106700,Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks,2018,JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS,100,7.0,76,10.1016/J.JECONBUS.2018.07.003,"Kingston Business School, Department of Accounting, Finance and Informatics, Kingston Hill CampusKT2 7LB, United Kingdom","the purpose of this paper is to develop an insight and review the effect of fintech development against the broader environment in financial technology. we further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of fintech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. by drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. it is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. this paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. while it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. it relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. it also draws on professional practitioners roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. we attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. the last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. it has made the financial market law and compliance a key topic on the current agenda. disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. we contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. we also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. the aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. the difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. it becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. for example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. these should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. as a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. it is also of interest to bankers who might consider fintech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 ",business models;

(i) develop a european or national fintech market? (ii) what regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) should supervision of fintech be exercised at the european level? (iv) what is the overall vision for the eu's financial system? getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system. in contrast, late action could mean that europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in europe.

London School of Economics, United Kingdom; Henley Business School, United Kingdom","the emergence of financial technology around the globe is driven by efforts to deconstruct and reimagine business models embedded within financial services. entrepreneurial endeavours to this end are diverse. indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies. this study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. it is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in swift's innotribe competition. we used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. the main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified. collectively, our results offer new insights into the diversity and range of emergent innovations and technologies that q2 are transforming the financial services industry worldwide. copyright ",,classification (of information);

Coetzee J,57213394294,Strategic implications of fintech on South African retail banks,2018,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,21,,8,10.4102/SAJEMS.V21I1.2455,"Department of Economics and Finance, University of the Free State, South Africa","background: since the global financial crisis, banks have been exposed to new opportunities and threats unprecedented in history driven fundamentally by technology. so-called fintech disruptors are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. as banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. aim: to identify the strategic implications of fintech on south african retail banks. setting: the study is conducted in the south african retail banking industry. methods: a post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. results: there are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. conclusion: by adapting to the fintech revolution, south african retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. this will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these.
