As part of the financial revolution, the Islamic finance sector ought to embrace Fintech to diversify the services/products offered as the digitalisation process is taking place in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era. In order to safeguard the assimilation of the technology into the existing traditional practice of Islamic finance, Shariah-compliant regulation is, therefore, necessary for governing the potential risks associated throughout the process of financial activities. Hence, this paper intends to analyse the need for Shariah-compliant regulation to govern Fintech-related activity in the Islamic finance industry. The article emphasises the need from several aspects such as the non-comprehensiveness of the Islamic Financial Services Act (IFSA) 2013; the increasing rate of financial inclusion and; the qualifications of the Shariah Advisory Council's (SAC) members in Malaysia. It also provides recommendations through the introduction of subsidiary legislation pursuant to IFSA; production of regulatory sandbox framework especially for Islamic Fintech firms; and emphasis on the importance of SAC members possessing knowledge in technological aspect in order to ensure the need for Shariah-compliant regulation in the Islamic finance industry is properly satisfied. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press","Appraisal; Fintech; Islamic finance; Malaysia; Shariah-compliant regulation",,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, MOHE: FRGS/1/2018/ SSI10/MMU","of Higher Education (MOHE) for sponsoring this work under the project (FRGS/1/2018/ SSI10/MMU) and the Faculty of Law, Multimedia University, Melaka (MMU) for the moral support throughout the research.",,,,,,,,,,"Al-Bakri, Z.

Despite the numerous economic benefits associated with this innovation, physical cash for financial transactions is still prevalent. Banks are still experiencing some level of cash withdrawals and deposits by individuals who refuse to embrace modern technology. This study stresses the economic benefits of e-payment channels available today and statistically supports evidence to substantiate their usefulness. In this study, we use banks' e-money products as the independent variables, while GDP is employed as a proxy for the economy. The data are collected from 2006-2019 and are analyzed with multiple regression techniques using E-views version 9 software. The result shows that all banks' e-money products have a significant favorable influence on the economy except the POS that is yet to gain momentum. The study suggests the full implementation of the cashless policy, proper education of the populace and guidelines to check electronic fraud. © 2021 Cordelia Onyinyechi Omodero, published by Sciendo.","banks; cashless policy; e-money products; financial sector; FinTech innovation; GDP",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adeyemo, K.A., Isiavwe, D., Adetula, D., Olusanmi, O., Owolabi, F., Mandatory adoption of the Central Bank of Nigeria's cashless and e-payment policy: Implications for bank customers (2020) Banks and Bank Systems, 15 (2), pp. 243-253; Ali, M., Hashmi, S.H., Nazir, M.R., Bilal, A., Nazir, M.J., Does financial inclusion enhance economic growth?

First, 848 publications were obtained from Web of Science. Their fundamental characteristics were analyzed, including the types, annual publications, hot research directions, and foci (by theme analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and timeline analysis of author keywords). Next, the prolific objects (at the level of countries/regions, institutions, journals, and authors) and corresponding pivotal cooperative relationship networks were used to highlight who pays attention to FinTech. Furthermore, the citation structures of authors and journals were investigated, including citation and co-citation. Additionally, this paper presents the burst detection analysis of cited authors, journals, and references. Finally, combining the analysis results with the current financial environment, the challenges and future development opportunities are discussed further. Accordingly, a comprehensive study of the FinTech documents not only reviews the current research characteristics and trajectories but also helps scholars find the appropriate research entry point and conduct in-depth research. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bibliometric analysis; Citation structure; Development trends; FinTech; Visualization networks",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71771155","This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71771155.",,,,,,,,,,"Admati, A.R., Hellwig, M., (2013) The Bankers’ New Clothes, , Princeton University Press; Agarwal, S., Zhang, J., FinTech, lending and pay innovation: a review (2020) Asia-Pac J Financ St, 49, pp. 353-367; Alam, T.M., Shaukat, K., Mushtaq, M., Ali, Y., Khushi, M., Luo, S., Wahab, A., Corporate bankruptcy prediction: an approach towards better corporate world (2020) Comput J; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) NW J Int Law Bus, 37 (3), pp. 371-413; Arner, D.W., Douglas, W., Buckley, R.P., Zetzsche, D.A., Sustainability, fintech and financial inclusion (2020) Eur Buw Organ Law Re, 21 (1), pp. 7-35; Au, Y.A., Kauffman, R.J., The economics of mobile payments: understanding stakeholder issues for an emerging financial technology application (2008) Electron Comme R A, 7 (2), pp. 141-164; Belanche, D., Casalo, L.V., Flavian, C., Artificial intelligence in FinTech: understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers (2019) Ind Manage Data Syst, 119 (7), pp. 1411-1430; Berger, A.N., The economic effects of technological progress: evidence from the banking industry (2003) J Money Credit Bank, 35 (2), pp. 141-176; Borgman, C.L., Furner, J., Scholarly communication and bibliometrics (2002) Annu Rev Inform Sci, 36, pp. 3-72; Buchak, G., Matvos, G., Piskorski, T., Seru, A., FinTech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks (2018) J Financ Econ, 130 (3), pp. 453-483; Cao, L.B., Yuan, G., Leung, T., Zhang, W., Special issue on AI and FinTech: the challenge ahead (2020) IEEE Intell Syst, 35 (3), pp. 3-6; Castiglione, A., Pizzolante, R., De Santis, A., Carpentieri, B., Castiglione, A., Palmieri, F., Cloud-based adaptive compression and secure management services for 3D healthcare data (2015) Future Gener Comput Syst, 43, pp. 120-134; Castiglione, A., De Santis, A., Soriente, C., Taking advantages of a disadvantage: digital forensics and steganography using document metadata (2007) J Syst Softw, 80 (5), pp. 750-764; Chen, Z.M., Li, Y.S., Wu, Y.W., Luo, J.J., The transition from traditional banking to mobile internet finance: an organizational innovation perspective - a comparative study of Citibank and ICBC (2017) Financ Innov, 3 (1), pp. 1-16; Chen, M.A., Wu, Q.X., Yang, B.Z., How valuable is FinTech innovation?

This study aims to evaluate factors that influence Hungarian Generation X's behavioral intentions to use mobile payment services during the pandemic. We conducted an electronic questionnaire-based survey among 1120 Generation X individuals. Using structural equation modeling to analyze the study's conceptual model, our results confirm that perceived COVID-19 risk, perceived usefulness, and subjective norms significantly influence Hungarian Generation X's behavioral intentions to use mobile payment services. Moreover, perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention to use mobile payment systems. Overall, our results show that the model of perceived COVID-19 risk, perceived usefulness, subjective norms, and perceived ease of use explains 62.9% of the variance in intention to use mobile payment systems. Our study contributes to the technology acceptance model and highlights its effectiveness in explaining the behavioral intention to adopt mobile payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s)","COVID-19; Gen X; Hungary; Mobile FinTech payment services; Structural Equation Modeling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abrahão, R.D.S., Moriguchi, S.N., Andrade, D.F., Intention of adoption of mobile payment: An analysis in the light of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (2016) RAI Rev.

In this article, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by R&D activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","China; family firms; fintech; small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); state-owned enterprises (SOEs)","Electrical engineering; Engineering; Business financing; Business practices; Chinese context; Family firms; Internet based technology; Peer-to-peer lending; Small and medium-sized enterprise; State owned enterprise; Fintech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dorfleitner, G., Hornuf, L., Schmitt, M., Weber, M., (2017) FinTech InGermany, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-54666-7, New York, NY, USA: Springer; Zhu, X., Understanding China's growth: Past, present and future (2012) J.

Or have lending players been acting similar to free-riders? This paper constructs a new proxy to investigate lending platform misconduct and compares the FICO score and the LendingClub credit grade. To examine whether the lack of verification by the Fintech platform affects lenders’ collection performance, I explore the recovery rate (RR) of non-performing loans through a mixed-continuous model. The regression results show that the degree of prudence taken by the lending platform in the pre-screening activity negatively affects the detection of some misreporting borrowers. I also find that the Fintech platform’s missing verification information (e.g., annual income and employment length) affects the RR of non-performing loans, thereby hampering lenders’ collection performance. © 2021, The Author(s).","Credit grade; Misconduct; Misreporting; Peer to peer lending; Recovery rate",,,,,,,"This reasearch is not funded by a specif project grant.",,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Chadha, S., Corporate governance and accounting scandals (2005) J Law Econ, 48 (2), pp. 371-406; Ahlers, G.K., Cumming, D., Günther, C., Schweizer, D., Signaling in equity crowdfunding (2015) Entrepreneurship Theory Pract, 39 (4), pp. 955-980; Altunbaş, Y., Thornton, J., Uymaz, Y., CEO tenure and corporate misconduct: evidence from US banks (2018) Financ Res Lett, 26, pp. 1-8; Amiram, D., Beaver, W.H., Landsman, W.R., Zhao, J., The effects of credit default swap trading on information asymmetry in syndicated loans (2017) J Financ Econ, 126 (2), pp. 364-382; On the rise of fintechs–credit scoring using digital footprints (No. w24551) (2018) National Bureau of Economic Research; Bergstresser, D., Philippon, T., CEO incentives and earnings management (2006) J Financ Econ, 80 (3), pp. 511-529; Bertsch, C., Rosenvinge, C.J., FinTech credit: Online lending platforms in Sweden and beyond (2019) Sveriges Riksbank Econ Rev (sweden), 2, pp. 42-70; Burns, N., Kedia, S., The impact of performance-based compensation on misreporting (2006) J Financ Econ, 79 (1), pp. 35-67; Calabrese, R., Predicting bank loan recovery rates with a mixed continuous-discrete model (2014) Appl Stoch Model Bus Ind, 30 (2), pp. 99-114; Chami, R., Fullenkamp, C., Sharma, S., A framework for financial market development (2010) J Econ Policy Reform, 13 (2), pp. 107-135; Chawla, G., Forest, L.R., Jr., Aguais, S.D., Point-in-time loss-given default rates and exposures at default models for IFRS 9/CECL and stress testing (2016) J Risk Manag Financ Inst, 9 (3), pp. 249-263; Cheng, Q., Warfield, T.D., Equity incentives and earnings management (2005) Account Rev, 80 (2), pp. 441-476; Cook, D.O., Kieschnick, R., McCullough, B.D., Regression analysis of proportions in finance with self selection (2008) J Empirical Finance, 15 (5), pp. 860-867; Cragg, J.G., Some statistical models for limited dependent variables with application to the demand for durable goods (1971) Econometrica, 39 (5), p. 829; Cumming, D.J., Johan, S.A., Zhang, Y., The role of due diligence in crowdfunding platforms (2019) J Bank Finance, 108, p. 105661; Daley, B., Green, B., Vanasco, V., Securitization, ratings, and credit supply (2020) J Financ, 75 (2), pp. 1037-1082; Dechow, P.M., Hutton, A.P., Sloan, R.G., Economic consequences of accounting for stock-based compensation (1996) J Account Res, 34, pp. 1-20; Degeorge, F., Patel, J., Zeckhauser, R., Earnings management to exceed thresholds (1999) J Bus, 72 (1), pp. 1-33; Dorfleitner, G., Priberny, C., Schuster, S., Stoiber, J., Weber, M., de Castro, I., Kammler, J., Description-text related soft information in peer-to-peer lending–Evidence from two leading European platforms (2016) J Bank Finance, 64, pp. 169-187; Duarte, J., Siegel, S., Young, L., Trust and credit: the role of appearance in peer-to-peer lending (2012) Rev Financ Stud, 25 (8), pp. 2455-2484; Efendi, J., Srivastava, A., Swanson, E.P., Why do corporate managers misstate financial statements?

With the rise of financial technology (FinTech), which uses mobile devices and applications as promotional platforms, biometrics has the important role of strengthening the identification of such applications for security. However, users still have privacy and trust concerns about biometrics. Previous studies have demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (TAM) can rigorously explain and predict user acceptance of new technologies. This study therefore modifies the TAM as a basic research architecture. Based on a literature review, we add two new variables, namely, “perceived privacy” and “perceived trust,” to extend the traditional TAM to examine user acceptance of biometric identification in FinTech applications. First, we apply the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the defined objects and relevant criteria of the research framework. Second, we use the AHP results in the scenario analysis to explore biometric identification methods that correspond to objects and criteria. The results indicate that face and voice recognition are the two most preferred identification methods in FinTech applications. In addition, there are significant changes in the results of the perceived trust and perceived privacy dominant scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s).","AHP; Biometric identification; FinTech applications; Perceived privacy; Perceived trust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abhishek, A., Hemchand, S., Adoption of sensor-based communication for mobile marketing in India (2016) J Indian Business Res, 8 (1), pp. 65-76; Alhassany, H., Faisal, F., Factors influencing the internet banking adoption decision in North Cyprus: an evidence from the partial least square approach of the structural equation modeling (2018) Financ Innov; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of fintech: new post-crisis paradigm (2016) Georget J Int Law, 47 (4), pp. 1271-1320; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckey, R.P., Fintech, regtech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwest J Int Law Bus, 37 (3), pp. 371-414; Arner, D.W., Zetzsche, D.A., Buckley, R.P., Barberis, J., The identity challenge in finance: from analogue identity to digitized identification to digital KYC utilities (2019) Eur Bus Organ Law Rev, 20, pp. 55-80; Atmaca, S., Karadaş, H.A., Decision making on financial investment in Turkey by using ARDL long-term coefficients and AHP (2020) Financ Innov; Bagozzi, R.P., The legacy of the technology acceptance model and a proposal for a paradigm shift (2007) J Assoc Inf Syst, 8 (4), pp. 243-254; Barin, A., Canha, L.N., da Rosa Abaide, A., Magnago, K.F., Selection of storage energy technologies in a power quality scenario—the AHP and the fuzzy logic.

Employing daily data from June 2019 to August 2020, our empirical analysis shows that the outbreak of COVID-19 exacerbated volatility transmission across asset classes, while subsequent decreases in new confirmed cases globally reduced the intensity of these spillovers. The evidence for the USD and gold supports their safe haven properties during catastrophic events, while innovative technology products as represented by a financial technology index (KFTX) and Bitcoin were highly susceptible to external shocks. These results show that when push comes to shove, the buck stops with the USD and gold and that the exorbitant privilege enjoyed by the USD prevailed during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bitcoin; COVID-19; Fintech; Forex; Global equity index; KFTX; Oil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baker, S.R., Bloom, N., Davis, S.J., Kost, K.J., Sammon, M.C., Viratyosin, T., The Unprecedented Stock Market Impact of covid-19.

Hence, new studies play an essential role to improve Fintech investments. This study evaluates Fintech-based investments of European banking services with an application of an original methodology that considers interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and IT2 fuzzy TOPSIS models. Empirical findings are controlled for consistency by applying the VIKOR method. Moreover, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by considering six distinct cases. This study contributes to the existing literature by identifying the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives to improve the financial performance of European banks. Our empirical findings illustrate that results are coherent, reliable, and identify “competitive advantage” as the most important factor among Fintech-based determinants. Moreover, “payment and money transferring systems” are the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives. It is recommended that, among Fintech-based investments, European banks should mainly focus on payment and money transferring alternatives to attract the attention of customers and satisfy their expectations. This is also believed to have a positive impact on the ease of bank’ receivable collection. Another important point is that Fintech-based investments in money transferring systems could help to decrease costs. © 2021, The Author(s).","DEMATEL; European banking industry; Financial technology; Interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, R.G., Bordo, M., Duca, J.V., Money and velocity during financial crises: from the great depression to the great recession (2017) J Econ Dyn Control, 81, pp. 32-49; Asamoah, D., Takieddine, S., Amedofu, M., Examining the effect of mobile money transfer (MMT) capabilities on business growth and development impact (2020) Inf Technol Dev, 26, pp. 146-161; Azemi, Y., Ozuem, W., Howell, K.E., Lancaster, G., An exploration into the practice of online service failure and recovery strategies in the Balkans (2019) J Buss Res, 94, pp. 420-431; Bakar, N.A., Rosbi, S., Robust framework diagnostics of blockchain for Bitcoin transaction system: a technical analysis from Islamic financial technology (i-FinTech) perspective (2018) Int J Bus Manag, 2, pp. 22-29; Baykasoğlu, A., Gölcük, İ., Development of an interval type-2 fuzzy sets based hierarchical MADM model by combining DEMATEL and TOPSIS (2017) Exp Syst Appl, 70, pp. 37-51; Çalık, A., A novel Pythagorean fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS methodology for green supplier selection in the Industry 4.0 era (2021) Soft Comptg, 25, pp. 2253-2265; Căpraru, B., Ihnatov, I., Pintilie, N.L., Competition and diversification in the European banking sector (2020) Res Int Bus Finance, 51, p. 100963; Chang, R., Fernández, A., Gulan, A., Bond finance, bank credit, and aggregate fluctuations in an open economy (2017) J Monet Econ, 85, pp. 90-109; Chen, K., (2018) Financial innovation and technology firms: a smart new world with machines.

In this framework, a new model has been generated by considering the consensus-based group decision-making with incomplete preferences, Pythagorean fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Moreover, a comparative evaluation has been performed with Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I. Kompromisno Resenje methodology and sensitivity analysis has been made by considering 4 different cases. The main contribution is to identify appropriate crowdfunding-based funding alternatives for the improvement of the clean energy investments with a novel MCDM model. By considering the iteration technique and consensus-based analysis, the missing parts in the evaluations can be completed and opposite opinion problems can be reduced. Furthermore, with the help of hybrid MCDM model by combining DEMATEL and TOPSIS, more objective results can be reached. It is concluded that the analysis results are coherent and reliable. The findings indicate that the full launch is the most significant criterion for equity and debt-based crowdfunding alternatives. On the other side, the analysis has the highest weight for reward and donation-based alternatives whereas design is the most essential item regarding the royalty-based alternative. Additionally, it is also defined that equity-based crowdfunding alternative is the most significant for the service development process of clean energy investment projects. In this way, it will be possible to provide a continuous resource for clean energy investment projects. On the other hand, by providing financing with equity, there will be no fixed financing cost for clean energy investors. If these investors make a profit, they distribute dividends with the decision of their authorized bodies. © 2021, The Author(s).","Clean energy investments; Crowdfunding; DEMATEL; Group decision making; New service development; PERT; Project financing; Pythagorean fuzzy sets; TOPSIS; VIKOR",,,,,,"xy2020034; 035 / 03571600","This work is supported by the project of Sichuan county economic development research center of Sichuan provincial key research base of social sciences, ""research on the coordination mechanism of county economic, ecological and social coupling development of giant panda national park"" (xy2020034) and the social science special research project of Sichuan agricultural university ""research on innovation of modern urban agricultural development mode"" (035/03571600).","This work is supported by the project of Sichuan county economic development research center of Sichuan provincial key research base of social sciences, ""research on the coordination mechanism of county economic, ecological and social coupling development of giant panda national park"" (xy2020034) and the social science special research project of Sichuan agricultural university ""research on innovation of modern urban agricultural development mode"" (035 / 03571600).",,,,,,,,,"Ahlers, G.K., Cumming, D., Günther, C., Schweizer, D., Signaling in equity crowdfunding (2015) Entrep Theory Pract, 39 (4), pp. 955-980; Akram, M., Ilyas, F., Garg, H., Multi-criteria group decision making based on ELECTRE I method in Pythagorean fuzzy information (2020) Soft Comput, 24 (5), pp. 3425-3453; Akram, M., Luqman, A., Alcantud, J.C.R., Risk evaluation in failure modes and effects analysis: hybrid TOPSIS and ELECTRE I solutions with Pythagorean fuzzy information (2020) Neural Comput Appl, 23, pp. 1-29; Akram, M., Kahraman, C., Zahid, K., Group decision-making based on complex spherical fuzzy VIKOR approach (2021) Knowl Based Syst, 216, p. 106793; Akram, M., Ilyas, F., Al-Kenani, A.N., Two-phase group decision-aiding system using ELECTRE III method in Pythagorean fuzzy environment (2021) Arab J Sci Eng, 46, pp. 1-18; Albino, V., Ardito, L., Dangelico, R.M., Petruzzelli, A.M., Understanding the development trends of low-carbon energy technologies: a patent analysis (2014) Appl Energy, 135, pp. 836-854; Anton, S.G., Nucu, A.E.A., The effect of financial development on renewable energy consumption.

Roughly one trillion $ market value in less than thirty minutes vanished with the biggest one-day point decline in the history of the DJIA at the time. Since the market events took place in electronic markets, and algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, parts of FinTech, played significant roles, we handle the May 6 flash crash from the FinTech, SupTech, and financial supervision perspectives. With the flashback method, we analyzed the reactions of market participants, media, and two financial supervisors, the SEC, and the CFTC, to the market crash. We find that the technological imbalance between financial markets or institutions and their supervisors drove the markets in uncertainty, hence in a fear and panic environment. Since the imbalance has not diminished yet, the same risks still exist. As a remedy, we introduce a new concept and model with a well-functioning SupTech system to cope with the May 6 type FinTech crises. © 2021, The Author(s).","Digital finance; Financial authority; Financial crises; Financial stability; Financial supervision; Financial system; FinTech; FinTech crises; Inform-your-markets; Informational efficiency; Know-your-data; Know-your-markets; Know-your-technology; May 6 flash crash; Prudential supervisory disclosure; RegTech; Supervisory technology; SupTech; Systemically important data; Systemically important markets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ait-Sahalia, Y., Saglam, M., (2013) High Frequency Traders: Taking Advantage of Speed, , National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge; Anginer, D., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Mare, S.D., Bank capital, institutional environment and systemic stability (2018) Journal of Financial Stability, pp. 97-106; Arner, D.W.J., Barberisbuckley, R.P., The emergence of RegTech 2.0: From know your customer to know your Data (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, pp. 79-86; BaFin, F., (2018) Big Data Meets Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and Implications for the Supervision and Regulation of Financial Services, , BaFin, Bonn; Bundesbank, B.D., (2020) Supervisory Disclosure.

Roughly 3%–13% of funding required for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)– or around $50 billion to $125 billion -- could come from a ‘FinTech Dividend.’ Such a dividend derives from the use of FinTech platforms to increase savings and investment (overall), channel resources into publicly-funded as well as privately-funded SDG-related activities and policies, and encourage the use of internet platforms, which deliver novel goods and services that relate to the seventeen SDGs. Less than half of UN members have FinTech laws and policies – making FinTech a ripe area for right-regulating. Unfortunately, in areas like institutional reform – no amount of money can guarantee achieving the SDGs, without wider legal and administrative reforms. And no clear data about the exact policies needed to help grow an economy (or pay for SDG spending) serve as any guide. With total investment in FinTech stuck at around $150 billion to $200 billion – the hoped for deluge of FinTech dollars on SDG activities may remain a trickle for years to come. © 2021 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, N., Gneiting, U., Mhlanga, R., (2017) Raising the Bar: Rethinking the role of business in the Sustainable Development Goals, , https://www.business-humanrights.org/sites/default/files/documents/dp-raising-the-bar-business-sdgs-130217-en.pdf, Oxfam Discussion Paper, Available from, [Accessed 15 March 2021]; Arner, D., Barberis, J., Buckley, R., (2016) The Evolution of FinTech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm, , https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geojintl47&div=41&id=&page, Georgetown Journal of International Law 47, Available from, [Accessed 15 March 2021]; Arrowsmith, S., (2012) The Purpose of the EU Procurement Directives: Ends, Means and the Implications for National Regulatory Space for Commercial and Horizontal Procurement Policies, , https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-yearbook-of-european-legal-studies/article/purpose-of-the-eu-procurement-directives-ends-means-and-the-implications-for-national-regulatory-space-for-commercial-and-horizontal-procurement-policies/121F2BAA1, Cambridge Yearbook of European Legal Studies 14, Available from, [Accessed 15 March 2021]; Asongu, S., De Moor, L., (2015) Recent Advances in Finance for Inclusive Development: A Survey, , https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/123655/1/agdi-wp15-005.pdf, AGDI Working Paper WP/15/005, [Accessed 15 March 2021]; Barrdear, J., Kumhof, M., (2016) The Macroeconomics of Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies, , https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2016/the-macroeconomics-of-central-bank-issued-digital-currencies, Bank of England Staff Working Paper 605, [Accessed 15 March 2021]; Beck, T., Pamuk, H., Ramrattan, R., Uras, B., (2015) Mobile Money, Trade Credit, and Economic Development, , https://voxeu.org/article/mobile-money-trade-credit-and-economic-development, Vox, 12 September, Available from, [Accessed 15 March 2021]; Becker, G., (2017) Does FinTech Affect Household Saving Behavior?

Fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic. This is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being. We have used the ‘bibliometrix 3.0’ package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically. The study suggests that ‘ACM International Conference Proceedings’ is the core source of published fintech literature. China leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications. Bina Nusantara University is the most relevant affiliation. Arner and Buckley provide impactful fintech literature. In the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes. These research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech. The study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams. These research streams are related to ‘cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology’, ‘financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech)’, and ‘machine learning and deep learning innovations’. The study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density. These various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the market share of FinTech companies is still relatively small compared to that of more traditional financial services. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the status quo, current developments, and challenges ahead for the Latvian FinTech sector. We combine three analyses: a political and legal, economic, social, and technological environment (PEST) analysis; a survey among FinTech companies; and an analysis of the size and financial performance of FinTech companies during the last 10 years. We find that the current status of regulation is one of the main obstacles to FinTech development, because it does not sufficiently consider FinTech-specific aspects. Problems in attracting a skilled workforce and an environment that is not very supportive of new developments in finance are further challenges and might explain at least part of the growth and financial performance difficulties. A revision, modernization, and harmonization of regulation is essential to create a level playing field for all market participants: FinTech companies, traditional financial service providers, and those originally traditional players that are integrating FinTech solutions in their business model. Further efforts are also required to foster Latvia’s attractiveness for a skilled workforce. We hope that this study helps increase the visibility of Latvian FinTech and contributes to the development of the new Latvian FinTech strategy. © 2021 by the authors.

We show that fintech lenders acquire market share by lending first to higher-risk borrowers and then to safer borrowers, and rely mainly on hard information to make credit decisions. Fintech borrowers are significantly more likely to default than neighbor individuals with the same characteristics borrowing from traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, they tend to experience a short-lived reduction in the cost of credit, because their indebtedness increases more than non-fintech borrowers after loan origination. However, fintech lenders' pricing strategies are likely to take this into account. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Society for Financial Studies.

In this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (PD) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) originating from an emerging market. Analysing Indian Fintech SMEs, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing SMEs in mitigating PD. We demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating PD at pre- and post-internationalization phases. At the pre-internationalization phase, directors’ prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e. greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning. Taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments. Further, we draw implications for research and practice. © 2021 The Authors.

Many banks tackle the challenges of digitalization by cooperating with startup firms that offer technology-driven financial services and novel service packages (fintechs). In this article, we examine which banks typically collaborate with fintechs, how intensely they do so, and which form of alliance they prefer. Using hand-collected data covering the largest banks from Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, we provide detailed evidence on the different forms of alliances occurring in practice. We show that banks are significantly more likely to form alliances with fintechs when they pursue a well-defined digital strategy and/or employ a chief digital officer. Moreover, in line with incomplete contract theory, we find that banks more frequently invest in small fintechs but often build product-related collaborations with larger fintechs. © 2020, The Author(s).","Banks; Entrepreneurial finance; Fintech; Make, buy, or ally; Strategic alliance",,,,,,"Darrell Gwynn Foundation, DGF; Université du Luxembourg; Universität Zürich, UZH; Universität Mannheim, UMA; Universität Duisburg-Essen, UDE","The authors thank Luca Enriques, Alvaro Martin Enriquez, Gerard Hertig, Georg Ringe, Egle Vaznyte, Dirk Zetzsche, Kristin Van Zwieten, and the participants of the 5th Crowdinvesting Symposium (Humboldt University Berlin), the 4th International Conference on the Dynamics of Entrepreneurship (Mannheim University), the International Workshop on Financial System Architecture & Stability (Cass Business School), the 4th Luxembourg FinTech Conference (University of Luxembourg, Banque Internationale ?

Fintech adoption optimization expands the financial access to formal financial institutions, especially to vulnerable groups such as the unbanked population who predominantly reside in rural areas far from formal financial institutions. Fintech is viewed as a game changer to bring finance to the unreached communities via information technology and digital financial landscape. In this causal research, data collection was done via online questionnaires to 485 Fintech users between December 2020 and April 2021. Data analysis and path modelling was performed using smartPLS 3.0 software. Result shows user innovativeness as a significant predictor, directly and indirectly affecting the adoption of Fintech in Indonesia, while user attitude found the most important factor towards Fintech adoption. Financial literacy is the least important variable to predict Fintech adoption, contrary to popular belief. This indicates that Fintech usage requires less financial literacy and is potential to reach unbanked population and those with low financial literacy. To make Fintech more inclusive, the government needs to accelerate improving Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure such as widening mobile broadband penetration and soft infrastructure by encouraging Fintech startup, allowing regulatory sandbox for startups, and driving financial institutions to innovate through Fintech to bring financial services to unbanked population. © 2021 by the authors.

Fintech adoption can benefit the unbankable population, particu‐ larly in peer‐to‐peer services for financing. This opportunity is supported by the popula‐ tion that uses mobile telecommunication in Indonesia. Davis et al. [4] stated that 85 per‐ cent of the population in Indonesia has a mobile phone but only 64.8 percent of the pop‐ ulation actively use the internet. It shows that Indonesian society is open and ready to accept innovations. The adoption of Fintech in a country is believed to help the unmet demand and increase financial inclusivity of the society [5]. The advantages of Fintech adoption to communities is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and United Nation Development Program (UNDP) such as promoting zero poverty, ending hunger, or providing food security [6]. It also supports the agenda for clean energy adoption and preserves the ecosystem in a circular economy. However, to enhance its use, the customer must have a better understanding of the Fintech products and services by acknowledging the benefits and risks of Fintech adop‐ tion [1]. Willingness to try and use new financial services and products is not enough. Society must also have a culture for open innovation to accelerate Fintech adoption [7]. The recent pandemic of COVID‐19 has shown that people able to tech‐educated in a short time and force to manage their finance digitally. Previous study has linked Fintech adoption with several theories, including the tech‐ nology acceptance model (TAM), united theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTUAT), technology readiness (TR), theory of interpersonal behavior (TIB), institutional theory (IT), and individual innovativeness theory (IIT). Faraj and Pachidi [8] also found that institutional theory is beneficial in examining Fintech adoption. This study has chosen to focus on the TAM, IT, and IIT with some considerations; first, TAM is the leading theory to measure technology adoption [9] efficient in forecasting and explaining the new tech‐ nology acceptance [10]. Second, IT is the foundation of an institutional ecosystem that can promote Fintech services and engage with technology [8]. Davis and Sinha [11] reveal that institutional factors play a pivotal role in reinforcing information and communication technology (ICT)’s innovations to reorganize the corporations, including Fintech compa‐ nies. Finally, Rogers [12] describes IIT as levels of individual ability to adapt to a technol‐ ogy compared to others. Individual differences in the acceptance of a new change led to the initiation of individual innovativeness. Individual innovation plays a pivotal role in accepting new technology [13,14]. In Indonesia, Financial Service Authority supports Fintech adoption by its regula‐ tions. While it is more focused on Fintech in peer‐to‐peer services, the updated law re‐ garding security and financial literacy of the society is expected to develop as the regulator gets more experience [4]. Fintech development cannot depend only on the regulation to grow, but it needs to consider its user perspective and knowledge. A study in China found that government support is essential to boost user innovation and enhancement Fintech adoption [15]. Hence, the government may use this research to create new regulations and support Fintech adoption in Indonesia. The novelty of this research use factors that influ‐ ence Fintech adoption, such as brand image, financial health, and user innovativeness by including 485 respondents. At the time others were limited to financial literacy and gov‐ ernment involvement. The following section of this study, Section 2, presents theoretical background, pre‐ vious studies, and the methodology. Section 3 describes the result and follow by its dis‐ cussion in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research with implication, recom‐ mendation, and limitation.",,,,,,,,,,"Ryu, H, Understanding Benefit and Risk Framework of Fintech Adoption: Comparison of Early Adopters and Late Adopters (2018) Proceedings of the 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 3864-3873. , S Hawaii, HI, USA, 3–6 January; Mention, A.L., The Future of Fintech (2019) Res.

Inadequate frameworks in FinTech markets create regulatory friction and regulatory fragmentation. These limitations continue to feature when piecemeal regulatory transition occurs. The danger of EU Member States being left behind in the FinTech innovation race if the regulatory landscape is cumbersome or incomplete for new business models is real. Regulatory lag and regulatory friction also act as a ‘disenabler’ for ease of cross-border FinTech trade in the EU. This article critically engages with the manner in which the regulatory sandbox has rapidly gained critical mass in Member States as a valuable adaptive measure supporting a route to market for FinTech entrepreneurs. Against the backdrop of the European Commission’s Digital Finance Strategy, the article further advances scholarship on FinTech in the EU by probing the EU’s resulting regulatory dilemma, undertaking a systematic evaluation of the continuum of complex policy options available to the European Union in response to the spreading regulatory sandbox phenomenon. © 2021, The Author(s).","Crowdfunding; Crypto-assets; Digital finance; EU financial services law; FinTech; Initial coin offerings; Regulatory sandbox",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahern, D., Regulatory arbitrage in a FinTech world: devising an optimal EU regulatory response to crowdlending (2018) JBL, 3, pp. 193-214; Ahern, D., Regulators nurturing FinTech: global evolution of the regulatory sandbox as opportunity-based regulation (2019) Indian J Law Technol, 15, pp. 345-378; Alkadri, S., Defining and regulating cryptocurrency: fake internet money or legitimate medium of exchange (2018) Duke Law Technol Rev, 17, pp. 71-98; Allen, H.J., Regulatory sandboxes (2019) Geo Wash Law Rev, 87, pp. 579-645; Apolte, T., Jurisdictional competition for quality standards: competition of laxity?

Intelligent systems are replacing and cooperating with traditional software components. Thus, the same development processes and standards in software engineering ought to be complied in artificial intelligence systems. This study aims to understand the processes by which artificial intelligence-based systems are developed and how state-of-the-art lifecycle models fit the current needs of the industry. We conducted an exploratory case study at ING, a global bank with a strong European base. We interviewed 17 people with different roles and from different departments within the organization. We have found that the following stages have been overlooked by previous lifecycle models: data collection, feasibility study, documentation, model monitoring, and model risk assessment. Our work shows that the real challenges of applying Machine Learning go much beyond sophisticated learning algorithms – more focus is needed on the entire lifecycle. In particular, regardless of the existing development tools for Machine Learning, we observe that they are still not meeting the particularities of this field. © 2021, The Author(s).","AI engineering; AI lifecycle; Case study; Machine learning; SE4AI","Fintech; Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Software engineering; Artificial intelligence systems; Development process; Development tools; Entire life cycles; Exploratory case studies; Exploratory studies; Feasibility studies; Software component; Learning algorithms",,,,,,"The authors would like to thank Irene Wijk, Shiler Khedri, and Elvan Kula for their willing contributions to this project.

We elucidate the Planned Behavior Theory by including the perceived benefits and perceived risk variables to investigate its effect on intention to continue using FinTech. We also examined whether or not men and women are affected differently by the benefits and risk they perceive when using FinTech. Data were collected through online surveys, then being analyzed using GSCA. The results reveal perceived benefits are affected significantly by the convenience aspect and deliver a significant effect on FinTech continuance intention. The risk perceived by FinTech users is affected the most by legal risk. This study proves that gender is able to moderate the perceived risk influence on the intention to continue using FinTech, especially in the female user group. © 2021 The Author(s).","FinTech continuance intention; Gender; Perceived benefit; Perceived risk; Theory of planned behavior",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2018) Fintech Indonesia, , https://fintech.id/dokumen/aftech-annual-member-survey-2018, AFTECH.

Fintech services have boosted the number of users during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, to maintain the loyal behavior of consumers after usage, firms need to predict key reasons to enhance their intention to use the service and maintain current consumers in the long term. This study offers a model to assess the components of the perceived usefulness toward Fintech. Data were collected via Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and structural equation modeling was used to predict the factors that influence the intention and loyalty to use Fintech post-COVID-19 lockdown. The findings reveal that the COVID-19 lockdown, trust, data security and privacy, and especially staff services are factors that enhance the intention to use through perceived usefulness. In return, it builds consumers’ loyalty toward Fintech services and is considered a new normal behavior. This research sheds light on how Fintech firms develop their capabilities and increase their competitive advantages. Both theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. © 2021 The Author(s)","COVID-19 lockdown; Intention to use; Loyalty; New normal behavior; Perceived usefulness",,,,,,,"Fintech technology (Fintech) is an emerging innovation in the financial industry, driven in part by the era of Industry 4.0. Internet availability and mobile communication have become indispensable in modern life, making the US a huge market for digital financial services. Fintech includes checking bank balances, making payments, and performing account transactions ( Tiwari and Kartika, 2019 ). According to Forbes, consumer utilization of finance apps grew 71% in 2019( Salz, 2020 ). In 2018, the US Fintech market was $18, and Fintech start-ups have recently boomed ( Kauflin, 2020 ). Internet financial service users are going mobile, and most banks and other financial services are competing to gain a large number of users ( Fisher, 2001 ; Lee et al., 2012 ).

This study investigates the interrelationships between the development of fintech credit and the efficiency of banking systems in 80 countries from 2013 to 2017. The findings indicate a two-way relationship between them. More specifically, a negative relationship between bank efficiency and fintech credit implies that fintech credit is more developed in countries with less efficient banking systems. Meanwhile, a positive impact of fintech credit on the efficiency of banking systems suggests that fintech credit may serve as a wake-up call to the banking system. Therefore, fintech credit should be encouraged by the authorities around the world. © 2021 by the authors.

Mobile payment service (MPS) has emerged as the most crucial fintech service. While many studies have addressed the essential role of security when service providers and users choose to engage in financial transactions, the relationship between users distinct perceptions of security and MPS success determinants are yet to be examined. Thus, this study primarily aims to uncover the distinctive roles of platform and technology security by investigating how users react differently to their varying understandings of the MPS usage environment. This study proposes a research model comprising two security dimensions (platform and technology) and three MPS success determinants (convenience, interoperability, and trust). We evaluated the proposed model empirically by using an online survey of 356 users. The survey accounts users experiences of the selected MPS. The results show that a security driven MPS can essentially enhance or deteriorate users positive perceptions of MPS success determinants while they use it for financial transactions. To further understand how this recent trend of user perception of security affects the overall MPS usage experience, this study provides theoretical insights into the roles of platform and technology securities. Managerial insights on the design strategies of MPS providers are also provided based on the potential implications of users subjective and objective perceptions of MPS security environment. © 2021 by the authors.

This study investigates the factors that affected individuals’ acceptance of FinTech services, especially on internet wealth management platforms. The current research extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) published by MIS Quarterly with integrated financial consumption attributes (i.e., perceived value and perceived risk) alongside the core construct of UTAUT. Data were collected from an established survey company. The empirical results indicate that perceived value, perceived risk, and social influence are strongly related to individuals’ FinTech adoption intention, whereas performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived risk affect individuals’ perceived value, which in turn influences adoption intention. The proposed FinTech adoption model could contribute to information technology (IT) adoption research by extending the UTAUT in which individuals’ performance expectancy and effort expectancy affect their adoption intention indirectly through perceived value. Finally, the implications of the proposed new model for future research and FinTech practice are discussed. © 2021 by the authors.","FinTech platform; IT adoption; Perceived risk; Perceived value; UTAUT",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 2018WZDXM020, 71731009, 71732006, 72061127002","This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), grant number 71731009, 72061127002, 2018WZDXM020, 71732006.",,,,,,,,,,"Jiang;, Y., Ho, Y.-C., Yan, X., Tan, Y., Investor platform choice: Herding, platform attributes, and regulations (2018) J.

Fintech is a dynamic and innovative field that fully benefits from advances in information and communication technology. The concept of customer experience is multidimensional, analysed from various perspectives, and with distinct valences in different industries. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) approach, we proposed a model in which customer experience in fintech is the result of customer’s evaluation of the stimuli proposed by fintech companies. Using partial least squares equation modelling (PLS-SEM), we tested a series of hypotheses and validated the proposed model. The results showed that perceived value, customer support, assurance, speed and perceived firm innovativeness are positively related to customer experience in fintech. In turn, customer experience is positively associated with loyalty intentions of the customer. Our paper contributes in identifying the dimensions, the determinants and the outcomes of customer experience in fintech, while from a managerial perspective, we demonstrate how fintech companies must integrate customer experience in their business models. © 2021 by the authors.

I show that the consequences of FinTech are full of controversies, which are part of broader, long-standing debates on the role of finance in economy and society, and need to be approached from geographical perspectives. The intense fusion of fin and tech, arguably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, complicates and elevates these controversies to a new level. © The Author(s) 2020.","financial geography; financial governance; financial inclusion; financial regulation; financial stability; financial technology; FinTech","COVID-19; epidemic; financial market; governance approach; interdisciplinary approach; regulatory approach; research work",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 681337; European Research Council, ERC","The author disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement number 681337).

Using the frame of the ‘FinTech Cube’, we examine how FinTech unfolds through the intersections of key actors, technologies and institutions. We demonstrate the relevance of FinTech for two areas of geographical enquiry: i) the reshaping of global production and financial networks, and ii) financial inclusion and poverty reduction in poorer countries. In doing so, we accord particular attention to the significance of FinTech for theoretical and empirical research in economic geography. © The Author(s) 2020.","economic geography; finance; financial inclusion; FinTech; global financial networks; global production networks; international financial centers","economic geography; empirical analysis; finance; production system; technology; theoretical study",,,,,"National University of Singapore, NUS","Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the 5th Global Conference on Economic Geography in Cologne and the ?Emerging Production Networks of Fintech? workshop organized by the Global Production Networks Centre at the National University of Singapore (GPN@NUS) and Global Network on Financial Geography (FinGeo).

Employing the Semi-parametric Difference-in-Differences (SDID) we show that overall China's green finance related policies have led to a significant reduction in industrial gas emissions in the review period. Additionally, we found that Fintech development contributes to the depletion of sulphur dioxide emissions and has a positive impact on environmental protection investment initiatives. China is poised to be a global leader in green finance policy implementation and regulators need to accelerate the formulation of green finance products and enhance the capacity of financial institutions to offer green credit. While minimizing the systemic risk fintech poses, policy makers should encourage fintechs to actively participate in environmental protection initiatives that promote green consumption. © 2021 The Author(s)","Environmental protection; Fintech; Green consumption; Green finance",,,,,,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS: 21AZD067","Key Program of National Social Science Fund of China ( 21AZD067 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, D., Zhang, Z., Managi, S., A bibliometric analysis on green finance: current status, development, and future directions (2019) Finance Res.

Within this context of digital transformation and sustainable finance, Fintech has emerged as an alternative to traditional financial institutions. This paper, through a literature review and case study approach, analyzes the relationship between Fintech and sustain-ability, and the different areas of collaboration between Fintech and sustainable finance, from both a theoretical and descriptive perspective, while giving specific examples of current technological platforms. Additionally, in this paper, two Fintech initiatives (Clarity AI and Pensumo) are described, as well as several proposals to improve the detection of greenwashing and other deceptive behavior by firms. The results lead to the conclusion that sustainable finance and Fintech have many aspects in common, and that Fintech can make financial businesses more sustainable overall by promoting green finance. Furthermore, this paper highlights the importance of European and global regulation, mainly from the perspective of consumer protection. © 2021 by the authors.

Empirically, the result shows that the development of fintech has a negative impact on the profitability of SOBs and the regression results from the OLS estimation, the FGLS estimation, the Prais-Winsten estimation and the FE estimation are compared to ensure the validity of the statistical inference. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Big data; Product design; Profitability; Banking services; Financial products; State-owned commercial banks; Statistical inference; Fintech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Vives, X, The impact of FinTech on banking (2017) European Economy, 2, pp. 97-105; Buchak, G, Matvos, G, Piskorski, T, Seru, A, Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks (2018) Journal of Financial Economics, 130, pp. 453-483; Stulz, R M, Fintech, bigtech, and the future of banks (2019) Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, 31, pp. 86-97; Chen, K C, Implications of Fintech Developments for Traditional Banks (2020) International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 10, p. 227; Zalan, T, Toufaily, E, The promise of fintech in emerging markets: Not as disruptive (2017) Contemporary Economics, 11, pp. 415-431; Iman, N, Assessing the dynamics of fintech in Indonesia Investment Management and Financial (2018) Innovations, 15, pp. 296-303; Glasserman, P, Loudis, B, (2015) A Comparison of US and International Global Systemically Important Banks Office of Financial Research Brief Series, pp. 15-07; Demsetz, R S, Saidenberg, M R, Strahan, P E, (1997) Agency problems and risk taking at banks FRB of New York Staff Report 29; Thakor, A V, Fintech and banking: What do we know?

The global financial crisis of 2008 has established the credentials of the Islamic financial system as a sustainable financial system which can save the long run interests of the average citizens around the world while adding value to the real economy. The basic ethical tenets available in the Islamic financial system make it more suited and readymade to fight the economic aftershocks of a pandemic like COVID-19. The basic principles of ethical Islamic finance have solid connections to financial stability and corporate social responsibility within the wide-reaching business context. With the emergence of Financial technology (Fintech) it has provided a missing impetus to the Islamic financial system to compete on equal ground with its conventional counterpart and prove its mettle. The study uses discourse analysis along with the content analysis to extract content and draw a conclusion. The findings of the study indicate that COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for the social and open innovation to grow and finance world have turned to open innovation to provide a speedy, timely, reliable, and sustainable solution to the world. The findings of the study provide significant implications for governments and policy makers in efficient application of Fintech and innovative Islamic financial services to fight the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

From the perspective of finding a dynamic balance between innovation and regulation, this study considers reputation adjustment under new media participation, as well as the corresponding selection of an innovation path. It is found that the equilibrium strategy of an excessive innovative FinTech platform is directly related to its time preference. For platforms that pay more attention to the current interests, the high-pressure regulatory environment and public opinion supervision can effectively restrain excessive innovation, whereas for platforms that focus on long-term interests, appropriate relaxation of regulatory pressure and public opinion environment can encourage the platform to maintain its reputation by pretending to be compliant. © 2021 The Authors","FinTech innovation; Information asymmetry; New media; Regulation; Reputation",,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71790593, 71972066, 72001073","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant number 71790593 , 72001073 , 71972066 ).",,,,,,,,,,"Ahmad, K., Han, J.G., Hutson, E., Media-expressed negative tone and firm-level stock returns (2016) J.

The entrepreneurial ecosystem literature has identified the shared attributes of these systems, but understandings of their inner-workings, interconnectedness, and variance across such systems is lacking. This paper explores the emergence of FinTech entrepreneurial ecosystems in London and Singapore, finding that a single accelerator actor has played a significant role in driving their emergence out of the existing, broader, entrepreneurial ecosystems. It argues that while the entrepreneurial ecosystem literature benefits from a conceptualisation of these ecosystems as complex adaptive systems, there must be a consideration of the potential for transformative agency by actors in the evolutionary dynamics of entrepreneurial ecosystems. © 2021 The Author(s)","Accelerator; Complex adaptive systems; Entrepreneurial ecosystem; FinTech; Startup","ecosystem approach; entrepreneur; finance; innovation; network analysis; England; London [England]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alvedalen, J., Boschma, R., A critical review of entrepreneurial ecosystems research: Towards a future research agenda (2017) Eur.

Ecosystems, financial ecologies, and digital platform economies are the most popular approaches to FinTech, and I argue that they can be used fruitfully in combination with more established concepts, such as networks and agglomeration. Overall, I show that FinTech research is in a state of flux concerning concepts and empirics, and highlight the potential of geography to tame the beast. © The Author(s) 2020.","ecosystems; financial geography; financial technology; FinTech; platform economy",,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 681337; European Research Council, ERC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement number 681337).

By using the data from fintech companies' CEO interviews, we assess the key trends in fintech companies' development over the past 3 years, reveal key technologies used by these companies and their evolution, and state the importance and relevance of digital logistics issues for fintech companies clients' satisfaction. The research indicates that for fintech company client the ease of getting through the service (optimization of information flows) appears to be more important than other characteristics of the offered product.

With a primary objective to improve financial inclusion for unbanked population in emerging economies through mobile devices, Fintech have become new commercial entities that promise to deliver millennium goals of World Bank and G20 nations. The availability of huge user data due to use of mobile devices and its use to generate sales of financial products, FinTech companies and solutions are constantly changing and are unique to each Fintech company. Fintech have devised a business model to provide financial services in the form of payment services, wealth management, crowd funding, lending services, forex services for remittance, digital wallets and digital currencies. The data driven business model, connected customers over mobile phones and several financial services demand new regulatory framework that also protects consumers and prevents systemic risk in the economy. In this paper, we have identified the regulatory guidelines issued for various financial product for customers and challenges Fintech will need to solve to provide innovative services. The paper aims to cover the life cycle of products, scope of innovation for Fintech and methods to meet requirements by regulatory bodies.

Since Robo-Advisor is one of the mature applications of Fintech, we found that the development of Fintech will have a greater impact on small and medium-sized banks through the establishment of a Robo-Advisor model. This paper uses a benchmark regression model to analyze the municipal digital financial inclusion index compiled by Peking University and the annual report data of 155 small and medium-sized banks from 2011 to 2016. We found that the development of Fintech has significantly reduced bank risk-taking level. This result is still valid after the robustness test of replacing the bank’s risk-taking index and replacing the Fintech development index. We used the urban innovation index as an instrumental variable to deal with the endogenous problem, and obtained consistent estimation results. The test of the intermediary effect shows that the development of Fintech will affect the bank risk-taking through channels such as the bank’s internal interest margin, management capabilities, the bank’s external competition intensity, and residents’ saving willingness. Heterogeneity analysis shows the reduction effect of Fintech on bank risk-taking is more pronounced in banks in eastern and western regions in China, the large banks and the urban commercial banks. © 2021 by the authors.

Motivated by this agenda, this study examined the direct and indirect effect of financial technology (fintech) and its sub-measures of third-party payment and credit on poverty measured by household per capita consumption. We used a panel of 31 provinces in China from 2011 to 2017. The results indicated that fintech and these sub-measures reduce poverty in China. The results further showed that fintech complements economic growth and financial development to reduce poverty in China. © 2021 by the authors.

This study investigates the relationships between four sub-dimensions of technostress (complexity, overload, invasion, and uncertainty), digital technology self-efficacy, and fintech usage intention. Data from a total of 266 Chinese Gen Z consumers were used in multiple regression analysis. The results of the study generally support that all sub-dimensions of technostress were negatively related to fintech usage intention. Related to the moderating effects of digital technology self-efficacy on the relationship between the four sub-dimensions of technostress and fintech usage intention, significant interaction effects with complexity and overload were found. Finally, the study discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings. © 2021 by the author.

At the end of 2019, the Financial Services Authority (OJK), the financial authority in Indonesia, recorded 164 registered and licensed fintech (P2P lending) companies. However, since early 2018, the Investment Alert Task Force (SWI) and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology have blocked 1,350 illegal fintech platforms. Illegal fintech lending practices have mechanisms beyond the responsibility and authority of the OJK, including the risk of collection and distribution of personal data. The essence of this study is to discuss the landscape of fintech P2P lending in Indonesia from Indonesian Online News data, explore cases of fintech p2p lending in Indonesia, and understand the rules and policies. Qualitative research with a case study approach and Focus Group Discussion techniques were used to obtain data from 4 stakeholders in the Fintech P2P Lending Industry in Indonesia. VOS Viewer software is used to build keywords from Indonesian Online News collections, NVIVO 12 qualitative software is used to assist data analysis. The research found the keyword clusters most frequently discussed in the Indonesian Online News collection and five case themes such as public awareness about P2P lending (user understanding), data leakage, and restriction of data access, including personal data protection, personal data fraud, illegal fintech lending, and Product marketing ethics. © 2021 The Authors","Financial technology; Fintech; Focus Group Discussion; Indonesia; P2P lending",,,,,,"Universitas Indonesia, UI: NKB-3224/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020","This research was funded by HIBAH Publikasi Terindeks Internasional (PUTI) Doktor, Universitas Indonesia , grant number NKB-3224/UN2.RST/HKP.05.00/2020 .",,,,,,,,,,"Abubakar, L., Handayani, T., Financial technology: legal challenges for Indonesia financial sector (2018) IOP Conf.

This has led to the emerging field called financial technology or simply FinTech. In this editorial review, we first provide an overview on relevant technological, pedagogical, and managerial issues pertaining to FinTech teaching and research, with a focus on market trading, artificial intelligence, and blockchain in finance. And then we introduce the articles appearing in this special section. We hope that our discussions of potential research directions and topics in FinTech will stimulate future research in the fields of information systems and finance toward making their unique marks in the FinTech evolution and the associated business and societal innovations. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

The growth of the sharing economy through financial technology (FinTech) makes it possible for small enterprises to receive access for credit. However, not all small business owners want to receive financing from FinTech companies. This study aims to analyze factors affecting FinTech adoption in small enterprises and its impact on business sustainability. The modified UTAUT 2 model was applied in this study. There were 184 small food business owners participating as respondents. To analyze the causal relationship between variables, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was implemented. The results of the research found that knowledge, safety perceptions, performance expectations, social influence, facilitation conditions and price values affect FinTech adoption by small food business owners. Moreover, FinTech adoption influences small food business sustainability. Several important recommendations for researchers, the FinTech industry and policy makers are formulated. © 2021 by the authors.

Consequently, in our opinion, the utilization of FINTECH financial transactions leads to а risk-reduction approach when in contact with other people. Moreover, financial transactions with FINTECH can save up customers’ pecuniary funds. Therefore, during crises, FINTECH applications can be perceived as more competitive than the traditional banking system. All the above have provoked us to conduct research related to the utilization of financial transactions with FINTECH before and after the COVID-19 crisis outbreak. The aim of the article is to present a survey analysis of FINTECH utilization of individual customers before and after the crisis in Bulgaria. The methodology includes a questionnaire survey of 242 individual respondents. For the data processing, we implemented statistical measures and quantitative methods, including two-sample paired t-tests, Levene’s test, and ANOVAs performed through the computer language Python in a web-based interactive computing environment for creating documents, Jupyter Notebook. The findings bring out the main issues related to the implementation of financial transactions with FINTECH under the conditions of the crisis. The findings include the identification of problems related to FINTECH transactions during the COVID-19 crisis in Bulgaria. © 2021 by the authors.

With online transactions on the rise, the use of IT for automation of financial services is of increasing importance. Fintech enables institutions to deliver services to customers worldwide on a 24/7 basis. Its services are often easy to access and enable customers to perform transactions in real-time. In fact, advantages such as these make Fintech increasingly popular among clients. However, since Fintech transactions are made up of information, ensuring security becomes a critical issue. Vulnerabilities in such systems leave them exposed to fraudulent acts, which cause severe damage to clients and providers alike. For this reason, techniques from the area of Machine Learning (ML) are applied to identify anomalies in Fintech applications. They target suspicious activity in financial datasets and generate models in order to anticipate future frauds. We contribute to this important issue and provide an evaluation on anomaly detection methods for this matter. Experiments were conducted on several fraudulent datasets from real-world and synthetic databases, respectively. The obtained results confirm that ML methods contribute to fraud detection with varying success. Therefore, we discuss the effectiveness of the individual methods with regard to the detection rate. In addition, we provide an analysis on the influence of selected features on their performance. Finally, we discuss the impact of the observed results for the security of Fintech applications in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Box-15825, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","In the last few years, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has emerged as a regional hub serving as an incubator of the FinTech ecosystem, where regulators began implementing policies to encourage the growth of Fintech ventures in 2017. However, detailed empirical evidence concerning the impact of various FinTech-level and ecosystem-specific factors as determinants of FinTech success and survival is yet to be discussed. This paper investigates the underlying factors influencing the success of UAE-based FinTech ventures. Several factors are included in the analysis, controlling for the hedonics of the FinTech, including the business model, availability of and access to finance, and business ecosystem framework. Data are pooled using a semi-structured questionnaire conducted with 32 FinTech founders. A qualitative analysis with an ordered logistic regression model was performed. The findings suggest that the availability of resources, in particular through venture capital, is vital to the success and survival of FinTechs as microbusinesses. However, financial barriers, the regulatory environment, and legal issues have a detrimental impact on facilitating the creation and growth of FinTech ventures. Furthermore, the business model dimensions “product/service offering” and “value proposition” tend to influence the success of these ventures. The empirical model’s findings will serve as a data-driven tool to help guide finance policymakers in their decisions on how to promote this new sector. © 2021 by the authors.

This risk outbreak process along the qualification chain is dubbed the “fuze effect” in this paper as the process is similar to that of the fuze detonating explosives. This finding implies that the real risk comes from the uneven quality of P2P platforms, which is different from the dominant opinion that of their “credit enhancement services”. Our further study suggests that the fuze effect comes from deadweight cost caused by market competition. This study is of significance for risk prevention in emerging industries such as FinTech; that is, for the sake of sustainable development of emerging industries, the government must be vigilant about the fuze effect. © 2021 by the authors.

The study offers the descriptive and deductive analysis based on the literature review. The empirical part relies on the data from external databases as well as the dataset collected in a survey run among the FinTechs in Poland in January 2020. The paper reveals that Poland is a fast-growing FinTech market which satisfies various requirements such as the number of secure Internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, the available labor force, as well as growing tertiary education enrolment. The crucial obstacles to the development of the sector is the uncertainty about the availability of skilled workers in the future and the lack of proper legal regulations. © 2021 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is used to identify risk factors related to the use of new financial innovations, by examining how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contributed to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) which occurred during 2007 and 2008. Based on this analysis, the potential for similar concerns with smart contracts are evaluated, drawing on the failure of The DAO on the Ethereum blockchain, which involved the loss of over $60m of digital currency. Findings: Extensive use of bilateral agreements, complexity and lack of standardization, lack of transparency, misuse and speed of contagion were factors that contributed to the GFC that could also become material concerns for smart contract technology as its adoption grows. These concerns, combined with other contextual factors, such as the risk of defects in smart contracts and cyberattacks, could lead to potential destabilization of the broader financial system. Practical implications: The paper’s findings provide insights to help make the design, management and monitoring of smart contract technology more robust. They also provide guidance for key stakeholders on proactive steps that can be taken with smart contract technology to avoid repeating the types of oversights that contributed to the GFC. Originality/value: This paper draws attention to the risks associated with the adoption of disruptive FinTech. It also suggests steps that regulators and other key stakeholders can take to help mitigate those risks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; Digital currencies; Distributed ledger technology;

The study used a questionnaire-based survey distributed in different countries of the world using the LinkedIn platform for this purpose to reach the targeted population. The snowball sampling technique was used. The study targeted consumers with Fintech experience, especially in digital payments services. 507 samples were retrieved. For the analysis, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used. The study revealed novel results in predicting COVID-19 spread; these three variables (Fintech Behavior before COVID-19, Fintech Behavior after COVID-19, and Fintech Perception after COVID-19) could predict 52.5% of the variance in the dependent variable (COVID-19 Spread) (R2 = 0.525, p &lt; 0.05). The findings show that Higher Fintech perception and behavior among Fintech users will help in reducing the spread of COVID-19 by avoiding the use of contact payment methods. Contactless payment methods are the main tools in Fintech that might help in avoiding the probability of COVID-19 spread. Consumers' Fintech perceptions and behavior are the most influencing factors that could predict the spread of COVID-19 in this study, where digital payments are the main concern. It is recommended that consumers adopt digital payment methods and tools, especially contactless payment methods, to fulfill their financial services. Other researchers are also encouraged to use the same model to predict the spread of this virus in the Fintech context. © This is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.","Banknotes; Cashless; Contactless payments; Crisis; Strategy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Angelakis, E., Azhar, E.

Since the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasing tremendously, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted agile IoT is the way forward for sustainable finance. The deepness of the agile IoT has probably transformed the financial market today, and it may rapidly develop as a dominant tool in the future. The integration of AI and IoT techniques will considerably extract valued financial data and avail better services to the customers. One of the important concepts involved in FinTech is financial crisis prediction (FCP), which is a process of determining the financial status of a company. With this motivation, this paper designs a novel artificial intelligence assisted IoT based FCP (AIAIoT-FCP) model in the FinTech environment. The proposed AIAIoT-FCP model encompasses different stages such as data collection, data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. At the primary stage, the financial data of the enterprises are collected by the use of the IoT devices such as smartphones and laptops. Besides, a chaotic Henry gas solubility optimization based feature selection (CHGSO-FS) technique is applied to select optimum features. In addition, a deep extreme learning machine (DELM) based classifier is used to determine the class labels of the financial data. Finally, the Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (NADAM) based hyperparameter optimizer of the DELM model is involved to boost the classification performance of the DELM model. An extensive simulation analysis is carried out on the benchmark financial dataset to highlight the betterment of the AIAIoT-FCP model. The resultant values portrayed the superior performance of the AIAIoT-FCP model over the state of art techniques in a considerable way. © 2021, The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Data classification; Enterprises; Feature selection; Financial crisis prediction; Fintech; Internet of Things",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alaraj, M., Abbod, M.F., Classifiers consensus system approach for credit scoring (2016) Knowledge-Based System, 104, pp. 89-105; Aydin, A.D., Cavdar, S.C., Prediction of financial crisis with artificial neural network: An empirical analysis on Turkey (2015) International Journal of Financial Research, 6 (4), p. 36; Dastkhan, H., Network-based early warning system to predict financial crisis (2021) International Journal of Finance and Economics, 26 (1), pp. 594-616; Incorporating Nesterov Momentum intoAdam ICLR Workshop, (1) (2016) 2013–2016; The establishment of a financial crisis early warning system for domestic listed companies based on two neural network models in the context of COVID-19 (2020) Mathematical Problems in Engineering, p. 2020; Fernández-Arias, D., López-Martín, M., Montero-Romero, T., Martínez-Estudillo, F., Fernández-Navarro, F., Financial soundness prediction using a multi-classification model: Evidence from current financial crisis in OECD banks (2018) Computational Economics, 52 (1), pp. 275-297; Hashim, F.A., Houssein, E.H., Mabrouk, M.S., Al-Atabany, W., Mirjalili, S., Henry gas solubility optimization: A novel physics-based algorithm (2019) Future Generation Computer Systems, 101, pp. 646-667; Hoang, N.D., Automatic Impervious Surface Area Detection Using Image Texture Analysis and Neural Computing Models with Advanced Optimizers (2021) Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2021; Huang, G.B., Wang, D.H., Lan, Y., Extreme learning machines: A survey (2011) International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernatics, 2 (2), pp. 107-122; Jensen, R., (2005) Combining rough and fuzzy sets for feature selection."", , University of Edinburgh; Junyu, H., ; Kohavi, R., John, G., Wrappers for feature subset selection (1997) Artificial Intelligence, 97, pp. 273-324; Li, C., Li, H., One dependence value difference metric (2011) Knowledge-Based System, 24 (5), pp. 589-594; Metawa, U.J.N., Shankar, K., Lakshmanaprabu, S.K., Financial crisis prediction model using ant colony optimization (2018) International Journal of Information Management, 50, pp. 538-556; Metawa, N., Pustokhina, I.V., Pustokhin, D.A., Shankar, K., Elhoseny, M., computational intelligence-based financial crisis prediction model using feature subset selection with optimal deep belief network (2021) Big Data, 9 (2), pp. 100-115; Mohebbi, V., Naderifar, A., Behbahani, R., Moshfeghian, M., Determination of henry’s law constant of light hydrocarbon gases at low temperatures (2012) The Journal of Chemical Thermodynamics, 51, pp. 8-11; Neggaz, N., Houssein, E.H., Hussain, K., An efficient henry gas solubility optimization for feature selection (2020) Expert Systems with Applications, 152, p. 113364; Qasim, O.S., Al-Thanoon, N.A., Algamal, Z.Y., Feature selection based on chaotic binary black hole algorithm for data classification (2020) Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 204, p. 104104; Sankhwar, S., Gupta, D., Ramya, K.C., Rani, S.S., Shankar, K., Lakshmanaprabu, S.K., Improved grey wolf optimization-based feature subset selection with fuzzy neural classifier for financial crisis prediction (2020) Soft Computing, 24 (1), pp. 101-110; Siddiqui, S.Y., Khan, M.A., Abbas, S., Khan, F., Smart occupancy detection for road traffic parking using deep extreme learning machine (2020) Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences; Uthayakumar, J., Metawa, N., Shankar, K., Lakshmanaprabu, S.K., Financial crisis prediction model using ant colony optimization (2020) International Journal of Information Management, 50, pp. 538-556; Uthayakumar, J., Metawa, N., Shankar, K., Lakshmanaprabu, S.K., (2018) Intelligent Hybrid Model for Financial Crisis Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques.

In this regard, FinTech applications such as mobile financial service (MFS) play an essential role in building resilience during the pandemic. Hence, the aim of the study is to investigate the role of MFS platforms in economic resilience by empirically evaluating the determinants that influence the intention of Bangladeshi users toward adopting MFS platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic, through an extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Using the core structures of the UTAUT, the theoretical model was constructed based on the consumption attributes of financial services such as perceived value, as well as additional situational factors from the extended valence framework, including risk and trust. To test the model, data was obtained from 227 potential MFS users in Bangladesh with the aid of a structured questionnaire survey. Subsequently, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach was used to analyze the data. The findings showed that social influence, perceived trust, and perceived value are strongly related to the intention of users to adopt MFS platforms, whereas, perceived risk, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy were observed to influence users’ perceived value of the MFS platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, the study results indicated that the users’ perceived risk did not influence their intention to adopt MFS platforms during the pandemic. Therefore, the suggested adoption of the MFS framework during and after the pandemic could contribute to the existing research on the adoption of information technology (IT) through the expansion of the UTAUT, in which the performance and effort expectancy of users influence their intention to indirectly adopt MFS through perceived value. Finally, the significant policy implications and future research directions are further addressed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bangladesh; COVID-19; FinTech; IT adoption; Mobile financial service (MFS); Perceived value; UTAUT",,,,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities: 300102341667; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS: 20AJY015","This research was funded by the Key Project of the National Social Science Foundation of China (grant no. 20AJY015), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant no.300102341667).",,,,,,,,,,"Abdullah, E.M.E., Rahman, A.A., Rahim, R., Adoption of financial technology (Fintech) in mutual fund/unit trust investment among Malaysians: unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (2018) Int J Eng Technol, 7, pp. 110-118; Adaba, G.B., Ayoung, D.A., Abbott, P., Exploring the contribution of mobile money to well-being from a capability perspective (2019) Electron J Inf Syst Dev Countries, 85 (4); Aji, H.M., Berakon, I., Husin, M.M., COVID-19 and e-wallet usage intention: a multigroup analysis between Indonesia and Malaysia (2020) Cogent Bus Manag, 7 (1), p. 1804181; Ajzen, I., The theory of planned behavior (1991) Organ Behav Hum Decis Process, 50 (2), pp. 179-211; Al-Maroof, R.S., Salloum, S.A., Hassanien, A.E., Shaalan, K., Fear from COVID-19 and technology adoption: The impact of Google Meet during Coronavirus pandemic (2020) Interactive Learning Environments, pp. 1-16. , https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2020.1830121; Al Nawayseh, M.K., Fintech in COVID-19 and beyond: what factors are affecting customers’ choice of fintech applications?

Using a new hand-collected multisource database that maps FinTech start-ups incorporated in the UK from 2010 to 2015, this study examines how the characteristics of FinTech start-ups affect the types of financing used in the first three years after incorporation. The novelty of this study consists in the identification and analysis of the determinants that enable FinTech start-ups to obtain long-term debt and hence to finance their growth. The analysis is primarily conducted via a Tobit regression model. This paper contributes to the literature since we still have limited understanding of the financing of FinTech firms, even if academic literature examining the financing of start-ups has expanded in the last few years. The results from the empirical analysis demonstrate that unregulated FinTech start-ups are more likely to be financed with long-term debt. Asset structure, owner characteristics and the specific FinTech activity influence the funding source. Moreover, FinTech start-ups backed by equity investors receive less long-term debt funding than their peers. A better understanding of the debt financing of FinTech start-ups provides managers with valuable insights into ways of managing their firms. Furthermore, our results have relevant implications for the employment, competition and innovation, given the role that start-ups generally play in the economy. The study is limited to a sample of FinTech start-ups incorporated in an advanced economy, and thus the generalization of the presented results to developing economies will require caution. © 2021 The Authors","Debt; Fintech; Regulation; Start-up; Tobit; Venture capital",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016), https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-fintech-investment-growth-continues-in-2016-driven-by-europe-and-asia-accenture-study-finds.htm, Accenture.

United Nations general assembly has recommended increasing energy efficiency by considering the SDG-7 guidelines. In the contemporary period, E7 economies are deficient in producing the financial resources to ensure the availability of funds for the acquisition of energy efficiency. COVID-19 crises, lack of resilience in economies, devastating fiscal burdens, and tight monetary conditions of E7 economies are the major barriers. To resolve such issues, some innovative financing techniques, such as green financing, financial inclusion, and FinTech, were suggested to investigate. However, this research tested the empirical role of financial inclusion, green financing, and FinTech on the energy efficiency of E7 economies. Study findings have shown a significant role of such financing techniques on energy efficiency. Comparatively, green financing is found most fitting and highly supportive financing tool for energy efficiency among the three. The differences in attributes, financing mechanism, funds flow system, transection systems, and variation in support by the financial institution are the main reasons that lessen the role of financial inclusion and FinTech for energy efficiency. However, theorists must revisit the transaction system of FinTech and financial inclusion parameters like green bonds for energy efficiency attainment. Policymakers are suggested to develop viable and energy system-friendly policies to grant green finance to the energy systems of E7 economies, as conveniently as possible. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","E7 economies; Energy efficiency; Financial inclusion; FinTech; Green finance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alemzero, D.A., Iqbal, N., Iqbal, S., Mohsin, M., Chukwuma, N.J., Shah, B.A., Assessing the perceived impact of exploration and production of hydrocarbons on households perspective of environmental regulation in Ghana (2021) Environ Sci Pollut Res, 28 (5), pp. 5359-5371. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhvF2kt7zP; Anshari, M., Almunawar, M.N., Masri, M., Hamdan, M., Digital marketplace and FinTech to support agriculture sustainability (2019) Energy Procedia, 156, pp. 234-238; Arner, D.W., Buckley, R.P., Zetzsche, D.A., Robin, V., Sustainability, FinTech and financial inclusion (2020) Eur Bus Org Law Rev, 21 (1), pp. 7-35; Azhgaliyeva, D., Liddle, B., (2020) Introduction to the Special Issue: Scaling up Green Finance in Asia; Azhgaliyeva, D., Kapoor, A., Liu, Y., Green bonds for financing renewable energy and energy efficiency in South-East Asia: a review of policies (2020) J Sustain Financ Invest, 10 (2), pp. 113-140; Bayar, Y., Ozkaya, M.H., Herta, L., Gavriletea, M.D., Financial development, financial inclusion and primary energy use: evidence from the European Union transition economies (2021) Energies, 14 (12), p. 3638; Boutabba, M.A., The impact of financial development, income, energy and trade on carbon emissions: evidence from the Indian economy (2014) Econ Model, 40, pp. 33-41; (2019) Outlook.

This paper aims to assess the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and open innovation integrated within the public discourse in the social media of FinTech firms, using machine-learning-based social media analysis (SMA). Accordingly, we tracked the behavior of 21 firms based on the empirical material of 32,716 posts on Twitter. The outcomes showed dissimilar discourses based on FinTech firms’ activities. However, it was found that only financial infrastructure, lending, and personal finance fields have a discourse related to innovation and, to a lesser extent, related to the SDGs thematic. Thus, awareness of sustainable objectives is still far from being a relevant issue for FinTech, which, in general, has neglected to significantly mention SDGs; nonetheless, innovation and related terms are a consistent topic in this area. Furthermore, hints of the implementation of the open innovation paradigm and interest in novel technologies are demonstrated, in addition to the promotion of different actors and events on social media that serve as a showcase for firms that have a presence on Twitter. © 2021 by the authors.

Millennials are the generation which, compared to others, is characterized by the highest level of FinTech adoptions. In Poland, in 2019, about 75% of the Millennials used the services of FinTech. This paper aims to analyse and evaluate the selected determinants of using the innovative FinTech services by Millennials in Poland. To investigate how users adopt FinTech services, we have applied our own set of determinants – selected from an extensive literature review – covering both demographic, economic and behavioural characteristics. This approach allowed for an in-depth analysis of the examined issue. The essential empirical data were obtained based on the research using the CAWI method in December 2019 on a representative sample of Poles aged 25–40 at that time. Ultimately, 1,236 correctly completed questionnaires were used for the research. To analyse and evaluate the impact of selected determinants of FinTech adoption, a logistic regression model was used. The results obtained can thus be extremely important for managers of financial institutions. They provide information that can be used for activities aimed at maintaining FinTech’s customer base and allow to adjust the offer to the expectations of this group. Millennials most open to innovative FinTech services in Poland are young men with high and very high net income and not driven by low costs of financial services. They appreciate technological novelties, including the possibility of using a smartwatch, and when deciding on the choice of a financial institution, they do not care about the direct opinions of their relatives and friends, but take into account the opinions in social media. © 2021, Technical University of Liberec.

In this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of Fintech, base of the pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the SSA context. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources. The authors interviewed respondents from the Sierra Leone Fintech Association and four BOP entrepreneurs operating in different sectors. Findings: The authors find that Fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations. FinTech also offers growth possibilities for BOP entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies. At the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing BOP entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development. Research limitations/implications: This study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between BOP entrepreneurship, social value creation and Fintech. For example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like Fintech. However, in a country like Sierra Leone, which has experienced both a civil war and Ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by BOP inhabitants. Hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on Fintech's application in BOP contexts. Practical implications: A key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits. Fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs. Fintech offers BOP entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development. From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating Fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more BOP entrepreneurs using these services. Social implications: The authors find that at the same time, Fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of BOP consumers who interact with case firms. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on BOP entrepreneurship and social value creation by Fintech services in an SSA context. It is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's Fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or Fintech firms. Finally, there is a specific focus on BOP entrepreneurs engaging in micro-entrepreneurship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Base of pyramid (BOP); Entrepreneurship; Fintech; Sierra Leone; Social value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alkhowaiter, W.A., Digital payment and banking adoption research in Gulf countries: a systematic literature review (2020) International Journal of Information, 53; Alt, R., Beck, R., Smits, M.T., FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry (2018) Electron Markets, 28, pp. 235-243; Anderson, A.R., Obeng, B.A., Enterprise as socially situated in a rural poor fishing community (2017) Journal of Rural Studies, 49, pp. 23-31; Arner, D.W., Buckley, R.P., Zetzsche, D.A., Veidt, R., Sustainability, FinTech and financial inclusion (2020) European Business Organization Law Review, 21, pp. 7-35; Arslan, A., Golgeci, I., Haapanen, L., Tarba, S., Cooper, C., Degbey, W.Y., Cause-related marketing, legitimacy and internationalization of professional service firms: a case study of a football talent scouting microfirms (2020) International Journal Review, 37 (5), pp. 885-899; Ashenafi, B.F., Kingstone, M., Roelof, G., Emanuel, M., Kettles, N., (2020) The role of mobile money in financial inclusion in the SADC region: evidence using FinScope surveys, , Working Paper, 03/2016, FinMark Trust, South Africa: 2016 December; Asongu, S.A., Nwachukwu, J., Orim, S.-M.I., Mobile phones, institutional quality and entrepreneurship in Sub-Saharan Africa (2018) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 131, pp. 183-203; Baumüller, H., The little we know: an exploratory literature review on the utility of mobile phone‐enabled services for smallholder farmers (2018) Journal of International Development, 30 (1), pp. 134-154; Baxter, P., Jack, S., Qualitative case study methodology: study design and implementation for novice researchers (2008) The Qualitative Report, 13 (4), pp. 544-559; Beck, T., Senbet, L., Simbanegavi, W., Financial inclusion and innovation in Africa: an overview (2014) Journal of African Economies, 24 (1), pp. i3-i11; Berger, A.N., Demsetz, R.S., Strahan, P., The consolidation of the financial services industry: causes, consequences, and implications for the future (1999) Journal of Banking and Finance, 23 (2-4), pp. 135-194; Birkinshaw, J., Brannen, Y.M., Tung, L.R., From a distance and generalizable to up close and grounded: reclaiming a place for qualitative methods in international business research (2011) Journal of International Business Studies, 42 (5), pp. 574-581; Boateng, R., Sarpong, M.Y.P., A literature review of mobile payments in Sub-Saharan Africa (2019) ICT Unbounded, Social Impact of Bright ICT Adoption.

However, some households and firms may be excluded from formal financial markets due to asymmetric information and market imperfections, thereby adversely affecting equitable income distribution. On the other hand, among other things, access to finance is viewed as one of the key tools to fight poverty. This study develops a novel double FFI Model and applies the structural equation modelling to simultaneously analyze the interaction between financial technology, financial inclusion, and income inequality in a panel of 25 African countries over the periods 2011, 2014, and 2017. The results show that financial inclusion mediates the financial technology-income inequality relationship thus playing a fundamental role in reducing income inequality in Africa. On the policy front, the study urges African policymakers and regulators to craft policies that enhance Fintech developments and financial inclusion. © 2021 The Author(s).

Since the creation of the first cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin, in 2009, it is estimated that over five thousand variants of the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged. Virtual currencies have become widespread across the globe but their legal status and uses in various countries have remained uncertain. They have been variously classified as currencies, securities, properties, assets, commodities and tokens, and used as means of exchange but are not legally recognised as legal tender. In many jurisdictions their emergence was greeted with scepticism and express or tacit rejection by financial and securities markets regulators, but over time, owing to their increasing popularity, characteristics, positive and negative potentials, there has been a gradual shift towards their formal recognition and regulation. Regulatory authorities in many countries are now grappling with designing appropriate policy and regulatory framework for the crypto phenomenon. This paper interrogates the current legal status and efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies in two leading African nations, Nigeria and South Africa, and highlights the challenges of designing an appropriate regulatory framework for this enigmatic technology. The paper adopts the doctrinal legal research methodology, employing the descriptive, analytical, and comparative approaches. It follows a structured review and analysis of relevant extant legislation on currencies and securities in the countries to ascertain whether they cover cryptocurrencies. It then compares the current position of the law on the subject in the two countries. Bearing in mind that it may not be possible to totally ban dealing in cryptocurrencies, the paper concludes that regulation has become imperative. Drawing from the position on the subject in more developed nations, the United States of America (US) and the European Union (EU), this paper proposes a model of regulation of virtual currency not only for Nigeria and South Africa but also for other African countries. © 2021, North-West Unversity.

However, limited research theorises how new entrants and incumbents work together in FinTech ecosystems to shape financial inclusion. We undertake a theory-generating case study with multilevel interacting organisations in Ghana, where, like many other African countries, the growth in FinTech has led to new opportunities for financial inclusion. We conceptualise three practices, as building blocks at the ecosystem level, through which incumbents and new entrants shape financial inclusion: (1) innovative and collaborative practices, (2) protectionist and equitable practices, and (3) legitimising and sustaining practices. We articulate a theoretical model that explains how the practices shape financial inclusion and propose three theoretical propositions of how financial inclusion in developing countries is being scaled and shaped in terms of actors, relationships, and practices. © Operational Research Society 2021.","Developing countries; ecosystems; financial inclusion; FinTech; Ghana; theory development","Ecosystems; Finance; Building blockes; Case-studies; Collaborative practices; Ecosystem levels; Financial inclusions; Ghana; Innovative practices; Multilevels; Technology ecosystem; Theory development; Developing countries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2019) Payment systems statistics-first half 2019, , https://www.bog.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Payment-Systems-Statistics-First-Half-2019-Table.pdf; Bongomin, G.O.C., Munene, J.C., Ntayi, J.M., Malinga, C.A., Collective action among rural poor: Does it enhance financial intermediation by banks for financial inclusion in developing economies?

Authorities have increasingly invited stakeholders from high-technology sectors to participate in assessing the risks of, and designing responses to, new technologies. Yet authorities often struggle to attract stakeholders from such sectors to participate; a critical challenge identified but still undertheorised in the literature. Responding to this gap, this article presents a case study of the UK's regulatory sandbox for financial technologies, applying a document study, questionnaire and interviews to explore fintech firm motivations and apprehensions about participation. Drawing on the bureaucratic reputation literature, the study finds that fintech firms have a range of practical, reputational and normative motivations to participate, and these motivations are inextricably tied to the regulator's strong reputation with the sector as procedurally correct, high-performing and morally committed to facilitating innovation. On this basis, recommendations for practitioners and hypotheses for future research into the drivers of stakeholder participation in regulatory decision-making surrounding emerging technologies are proposed. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

The main intention is to leverage the businesses&#x2019; income and reducing cost by facilitating the benefits enabled by IoT-FinTech technology. To do so, some of the challenging problems that mainly related to routing protocols in such highly dynamic, unreliable (due to mobility) and widely distributed network need to be carefully addressed. This paper therefore focuses on developing a new trustworthy and efficient routing mechanism to be used in routing data traffic over IoT-FinTech mobile networks. A new Non-linear L&#x00E9;vy Brownian Generalized Normal Distribution Optimization (NLBGNDO) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of finding an optimal path from source to destination sensor nodes to be used in forwarding FinTech&#x2019;s related data. We also propose an objective function to be used in maintaining trustworthiness of the selected relay-node candidates by introducing a trust-based friendship mechanism to be measured and applied during each selection process. The formulated model also considering node&#x2019;s residual energy, experienced response time, and inter-node distance (to figure out density/sparsity ratio of sensor nodes). Results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism could maintain very wise and efficient decisions over the selection period in comparison with other methods.

A theoretical model was built to analyse the relationship between the assets and liabilities of peer-to-peer platforms and the risk of the entire online lending industry. The conditional value at risk method was used to measure the risk spillover effect of the online lending industry and the different types of platforms. Index smoothing and moving average were used to examine risk contagion. When the risk rate of the portfolio of the platform generally increases, the systemic risk of the whole industry also increases, and if the systemic risk of the industry spreads to the portfolio of the platform, it could affect the stability of the capital flow of the platform, and then affect the risk expectation of the platform itself. Most platforms with risk concerns were private. Banking platforms and public platforms were greatly affected by market risk; however, their own risks had relatively little impact on the overall market. The greater the market risk, the more platforms become risk platforms, and the smaller the impact on transition platforms. Regulatory sandboxes may be an effective means of preventing and controlling Fintech risks. © 2021 The Author(s).

FinTech plays a crucial role in achieving it. Therefore, the development of FinTech must be facilitated through proper policy-making and public finance, creating beneficial PEST conditions. However, the interaction of the FinTech PEST environment and achievement of SDGs is a topic that has not yet been addressed. The purpose of this study is to assess the link between these two indicators using statistical methods, indicate SDGs having the strongest link to FinTech PEST environment, and explain the interface to facilitate its useful application within government and financial regulations, as well as administration of the state and municipal financial entities. The results show that the economic and investment potential of Northern Europe is caused by the most favorable PEST environment for FinTech sector development, and demonstrate the existence of a statistical link between FinTech PEST environment and SDG4, SDG8, SDG9, SDG16. There is a clear trend – the more favorable the FinTech PEST environment, the better the achievement of SDGs, the better results of Sustainable Finance indicators, and the higher the Sustainable Finance typology assigned to the country. These results suggest that the goals, targets, and indicators of SDG4, SDG8, SDG9, and SDG16 contribute to the formation of a favorable environment and are conductive to the sustainable development of the FinTech industry in a country. Therefore, sustainability in the development of FinTech industry and finance, and the achievement of SDGs, is a circular process of three interacting factors. © Gintarė Pauliukevičienė, Jelena Stankevičienė, 2021","Agenda 2030; Correlation analysis; FinTech development; Sustainable development goals; Sustainable Finance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arner, D.

The periodization of the banking system from 2005 to the present in accordance with the strategic development goals and stages of the bank's life cycle has allowed to justify the relevant digitalization policy, appropriate for each period. It has been proved that the symbiosis of banks and fintech companies helps to increase the competitiveness and profitability of business in the long run. The importance of introduction of banking innovations in the crediting market as the most profitable direction of banking activity has been substantiated, the forecast of change in net interest income of Ukrainian banks for the post-pandemic period has been made. Based on the fact that the indicator of the country's success in implementing the norms and measures of the Digital Agenda for the EU and Digital Single Market is the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), which is determined for each EU country annually, the paper makes forecast changes in its components: Connectivity, Human Capital, Use of Internet, Integration of Digital Technology, Digital Public Services. The main factors that inhibit the processes of strengthening the interaction between banks and FinTech companies in Ukraine have been identified. The expediency of improving the current legislation of Ukraine taking into account the best European practices in the field of cooperation between banks and FinTech companies has been substantiated. © 2020 Estudios de Economia Aplicada.

The law and economics problem is twofold: (1) potential market failures, and (2) the issue of enforcement. This chapter discusses the foundations of financial intermediation and the traditional regulatory approaches to both banks and other providers of financial services. Our analysis establishes a distinction between FinTechs working outside and inside the blockchain. For the former, the crucial regulatory trade-off is between efficiency gains from innovation and regulatory arbitrage. For the latter, our analysis suggests that regulating the convertibility of cryptocurrencies into fiat money is a promising strategy not only to safeguard financial stability, but also to attract financial services to the regulatory perimeter, whenever it is efficient to do so. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acharya, V., Naqvi, H., The Seeds of a Crisis: A Theory of Bank Liquidity and Risk Taking Over the Business Cycle (2012) Journal of Financial Economics, 106, p. 349; Allen, F., Santomero, A.M., The Theory of Financial Intermediation (1997) Journal of Banking & Finance, 21, p. 1461; Allen, F., Santomero, A.M., What Do Financial Intermediaries Do (2001) Journal of Banking & Finance, 25, p. 271; Armour, J., (2016) Principles of Financial Regulation, , Oxford University Press; Armour, J., Enriques, L., The Promise and Perils of Crowdfunding: Between Corporate Finance and Consumer Contracts (2018) The Modern Law Review, 81, p. 51; Banerjee, A.V., A Simple Model of Herd Behavior (1992) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 107, p. 797; Benartzi, S., Thaler, R., Heuristics and Biases in Retirement Savings Behavior (2007) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 21, p. 81; Bhattacharya, S., Thakor, A.V., Contemporary Banking Theory (1993) Journal of Financial Intermediation, 3, p. 2; Boot, A.W.A., Greenbaum, S.I., Thakor, A.V., Reputation and Discretion in Financial Contracting (1993) The American Economic Review, p. 1165; Boot, A.W.A., Ligterink, J.E., Martin, J.K., (2018) Understanding Fintech and Private Equity, , Amsterdam Center for Corporate Finance; Boot, A.W.A., Thakor, A.V., Can Relationship Banking Survive Competition (2000) The Journal of Finance, 55, p. 679; Boyd, J.H., Gertler, M., (1995) Are Banks Dead?

This study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (fintech) and its interaction with financial inclusion and living standards (GDP per capita). We consider the determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to GDP per capita–a fintech diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel. We specify the interactions between these two channels and their relationship with income per capita. Our empirical analysis focuses on the diffusion of two enabling fintech innovations: ATMs and associated digital networks; and mobile phones and payments systems. The relationships between fintech diffusion, financial inclusion and GDP per capita are estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 1991–2015 using both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that distinguishes short- and long-run effects. A key finding is that fintech diffusion and financial inclusion have long-run effects on GDP per capita over and above their short-run impact and the effects of investment in fixed and human capital. © 2021 The Author(s).

The most important factors that influence the level of satisfaction when using FinTech services were considered: comfort and ease of use, legal regulations, ease of account opening, mobile payments features, crowdfunding options, international money transfers features, reduced costs associated with transactions, peer-to-peer lending, insurances options, online brokerage, cryptocoins options and exchange options. The study was conducted on a sample of 162 respondents, persons belonging to the Millennials and Generation Z generations. The values of the indicators for different categories of users of FinTech services and different categories of generations can be determined based on the statistical tests performed and the results obtained from the regression analysis. The values of the indicators are the basic elements for determining the regression model that will help the FinTech service vendors to make personalized decisions for each category of users so that the level of customer satisfaction is maximized. The study carried out within the present article is the first of its kind for Romania, because up to this moment in the specialized literature there are no such studies for Eastern Europe. The research we conducted aims to fill the gap existing in the literature and responds to the expectations and needs of stakeholders in the FinTechs’ business area. The results of the article are relevant to both stakeholders and the scientific community that is concerned about the impact of FinTech technologies. © 2021, Technical University of Liberec.

Maintaining a sustainable, resilient, and durable healthcare system facilitate economies to achieve sustainable competitiveness. Thus, it is important to address and fill the knowledge gap by identifying factors that improve a firm’s sustainability. Drawing on technological knowledge spillover theory, this study investigates the effect of FinTech development on the sustainable performance of healthcare firms using panel data comprised of 11 Asia-Pacific countries. By applying the 2-step GMM technique, we find a robust estimate that digital financial technologies improve the sustainable performance of the firms. Contrary to the substitution effect, our results further indicate that financial institutions are collaborating with FinTechs to facilitate financing at the individual and firm-level. We also find that financial and ICT development positively moderates the relationship between FinTech development and sustainable performance. © The Author(s) 2021.","ESG; financial development; FinTech; ICT development; sustainable performance","article; Asia; drawing; financial management; health care cost; human; human experiment; theoretical study",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The fourth author (Dr. Zhang Shaohua ) thanks partial financial support from Project “China’s ‘Missing Middle’: Typical Facts, Formation Mechanism and Macro Effects” (Grant No.71673253) and Project “China’s ‘Missing Middle’: Typical Facts, Formation Mechanism and Macro Effects” (Grant No.72073038) supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.",,,,,,,,,,"Bloom, D.E., Canning, D., Kotschy, R., Prettner, K., Schünemann, J.J., Health and economic growth: reconciling the micro and macro evidence, 2019, pp. 0898-2937. , National Bureau of Economic Research; Ogundari, K., Awokuse, T., Human capital contribution to economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: does health status matter more than education?

The paper describes a review of 88 refereed academic papers on the subject of FinTech published in journals that have high SJR2017 scores. Papers were categorised according to the type of companies leveraging FinTech (existing financial institutions vs. new entrants) and the type of value derived from FinTech innovation (new value-added vs. improved efficiency). Also considered were types of new value-added, geographical focus of the research and research methodologies. The largest number of studies concerned the use of FinTech innovation by new entrants to offer solutions to social issues or build new financial ecosystems. Over half the studies were on FinTech in Asia or the European Union, and the most common methodology employed was the case study.

The prediction of the Fintech index is significant as it is capable of instructing investors to avoid risks and provide guidance for financial regulators. Traditional prediction methods adopt the deep neural network (DNN) or the combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and DNN mostly. However, heavy computational load is required by these algorithms. In this paper, we propose an integrated artificial intelligence-based algorithm, consisting of the random frog algorithm (RF), GA, and DNN, to predict the Fintech index. The proposed RF-GA-DNN prediction algorithm filters the key input variables and optimizes the hyperparameters of DNN. We compare the proposed RF-GA-DNN with the traditional GA-DNN in terms of convergence time and prediction accuracy. Results show that the convergence time of GA-DNN is up to 20 hours and its prediction accuracy is 97.4%. In comparison, the convergence time of our RF-GA-DNN is only about 1.5 hours and the prediction accuracy reaches 97.0%. These results demonstrate that the proposed RF-GA-DNN prediction algorithm significantly reduces the convergence time with the promise of competitive prediction accuracy. Thus, the proposed algorithm deserves to be widely recommended for predicting the Fintech index. © 2021 Chao Liu et al.",,"Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Electronic trading; Fintech; Forecasting;

We develop this conceptualization through a case study of a Danish fintech start-up that uses machine learning to create opportunities for sustainable pensions investments. By way of ethnographic and literary methodology, we provide an in-depth analysis of the dynamic trajectory in and through which the organization gives shape to and takes shape from its key algorithmic tool, mapping the shifting sociotechnical arrangements of the start-up, from its initial search for a viable business model through the development of the algorithm to the public launch of its product. On this basis, we argue that conceptualizing algorithms as organizational figuration enables us to detail not only what algorithms do but also what they are. © The Author(s) 2021.","Algorithms; ethnography; figuration; fintech; living maps; sociotechnical arrangements",,,,,,"Velux Fonden: 00013146","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by Velux Fonden (Grant No. 00013146).",,,,,,,,,,"Alexander, J.C., (2017) The Drama of Social Life, , Cambridge, Polity Press; Ames, M.G., Deconstructing the algorithmic sublime (2018) Big Data & Society, 5 (1), pp. 1-4; Bader, V., Kaiser, S., Autonomy and control?

Both of these agency relationships currently run independently and are separate from other agency relationships, so they are not effective in improving performance. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual framework of the e-integrated corporate governance model at the peer to peer lending financial technology corporation to improve sustainability performance. The research method in this article was reviewing articles related to corporate governance, finding gaps and limitations. The results of this study are that because business processes in financial technology corporations are interconnected systems, both corporate governances must be integrated with information technology, in order to improve sustainability performance. With this model, asymmetric information between the three parties (depositors/investors, financial technology corporation, and small-medium enterprises) and all stakeholders can be eliminated, risks can be reduced, business processes and financial and non-financial information of the three parties is more transparent and accessible for all stakeholders. © 2021 Kasetsart University.","E-integrated corporate governance; Information technology; Interconnected system; Peer to peer lending financial technology corporation; Sustainability performance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aras, G., Crowther, D., Governance and sustainability (2008) Management Decision, 46 (3), pp. 433-448; Arena, C., Bozzolan, S., Michelon, G., Environmental reporting: Transparency to stakeholders or stakeholders’ manipulation?

China in particular, with a booming fintech sector and large numbers of users, is at the forefront of the expansion of digital financial services. As such, the country has become an important case for better understanding how fintech operates and what its expansion entails for socioeconomic development. This paper focuses on the provision of new models of digital finance in rural China by two Internet giants–JD and Alibaba. Against the backdrop of decades of generally unsuccessful attempts to expand financial coverage in rural areas by conventional bricks-and-mortar financial institutions, these two rural fintech models have the potential to expand digital financial service provision in new ways. This paper critically examines these fintech models, contextualises them within the broader trajectory of pushes to expand digital financial inclusion worldwide, considers the parallels with agricultural supplier contracting systems elsewhere, and explores the potential benefits and risks that they pose for rural development and rural livelihoods in China and elsewhere. © 2021 The Author(s).

Although EEs are fundamentally interaction systems of hierarchically independent yet mutually dependent actors, few studies have investigated how interactions among ecosystem actors drive the entrepreneurial process. Seeking to address this gap, this paper explores how ecosystem actor interactions influence new ventures in the financial technology (fintech) EE of Singapore. Guided by an EE framework and the use of an exploratory-abductive approach, empirical data from semi-structured interviews is collected and analyzed. The findings reveal four categories representing both the relational perspective, which features interaction and intermediation dynamics, and the cultural perspective, which encompasses ecosystem development and regulatory dynamics. These categories help explain how and why opportunity identification and resource exploitation are accelerated or inhibited for entrepreneurs in fintech EEs. The present study provides valuable contributions to scholars and practitioners interested in EEs and contributes to the academic understanding of the emerging fintech phenomenon. © 2021, The Author(s).","Ecosystem dynamics; Entrepreneurial ecosystems; Fintech; Network approach",,,,,,"European Commission, EC: 823971; Horizon 2020","We sincerely appreciate the insightful feedback the two anonymous reviewers provided.

Taking fintech as a sociotechnological phenomenon embedded in discourses of solutionism and innovation, we show that the regulatory sandbox accepts these discourses. Instead of containing fintech, the sandbox is designed in a way that advances riskwashing of fintech even if it is disguised as risktaming. Next, we demonstrate fintech’s problematic nature that regulation should control. First, we propose that through its information processing capacity, fintech accelerates the transition from bank-based to market-based finance. Second, we demonstrate that fintech as part of a fintech-financialization apparatus has catallactic and value-extracting governance effects. Third, inserting the fintech-financialization apparatus into Fourcade and Healy’s argument on the social stratification effect of the data-driven economy, we argue that it also has a socially disruptive potential. We critique the regulatory sandbox for being a facilitator to this process and recommend increasing the number and power of veto players and veto points in complex regulatory regimes. © 2021 The Author(s).

This trend can be observed clearly in the UK where fintech is developing within the context of the ongoing digitalization of the economy. This paper examines the role of the British government and regulatory authorities in sparking innovation to improve the way financial services are provided. At the conceptual level, fintech-specific policy presumes the existence of complex trade-offs between competition, market integrity, and financial stability. The special consideration is given to Open Banking initiative as a key driver of competition in financial services sector. By removing barriers to entry and grow for fintech firms the policy enablers try to solve the longstanding problems of financial exclusion. Particular attention is paid to key approaches to fintech regulation. The Financial Conduct Authority undertakes the constant review of regulatory perimeter as a means of mitigating risks to market integrity and ensuring consumer protection. The Bank of England is rethinking the notion of financial stability and reviewing the approaches to managing systemic risks. The paper regards the initiatives implemented by regulatory authorities to support innovator businesses as a way to ensure the world leading position of the UK’s financial sector. It is argued that the supportive government policy and progressive regulation are the overriding factors of fintech development in the UK. © 2021, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The objective of this study is to identify which factors most influence intentions to continue using these companies’ products. To achieve this, research by Ryu (2018) was replicated. Our adopted model evaluates the weight of seven factors composing two latent variables – perceived risk and perceived benefit – in the continuity of use of these services. The data collection was performed through an electronic survey, distributed through social networks during May and June of 2019. The main results confirmed seven of the eleven initial hypotheses, highlighting that the perceived benefits, especially the economic ones, were relevant to early adopters and seamless transactions were relevant for late adopters. Surprisingly, perceived risk was not a determinant of continuance intention. One of the contributions of this study is that it indicates some possible demographic and behavioral characteristics of Brazilian fintech consumers, opening up space for a better understanding of the market and service improvements. © 2021 FUCAPE Business School.

However, the massive amount of data (often called as big data) generated seamlessly across different geographic locations can end end up as a bottleneck for the underlying network infrastructure. To mitigate this challenge, software-defined network (SDN) has been leveraged in the proposed approach to provide scalability and resilience in multi-controller environment. However, in case if one of these controllers fail or cannot work as per desired requirements, then either the network load of that controller has to be migrated to another suitable controller or it has to be divided or balanced among other available controllers. For this purpose, the proposed approach provides an adaptive recovery mechanism in a multi-controller SDN setup using support vector machine-based classification approach. The proposed work defines a recovery pool based on the three vital parameters, reliability, energy, and latency. A utility matrix is then computed based on these parameters, on the basis of which the recovery controllers are selected. The results obtained prove that it is able to perform well in terms of considered evaluation parameters.

Surprisingly, Information Systems (IS) research has engaged little with fintech's promise of fostering financial inclusion for the poor. In the spirit of ‘making a better world with ICTs’, conducting ‘responsible IS research for a better world’ and ‘understanding and tackling societal grand challenges through management research’, we advance a framework for guiding IS research on fintech-led financial inclusion. Drawing on the IS literature and Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) scholarship, we extrapolate five areas of research that can better illuminate fintech's contributions to financial inclusion: (a) business strategies for fintech-led financial inclusion; (b) digital artifacts of fintech-led financial inclusion; (c) business environment of fintech-led financial inclusion; (d) microfoundations of fintech for financial inclusion; (e) developmental impacts of fintech. We conclude with a discussion of how the five areas offer opportunities for impactful research on fintech and the promise of building a financially inclusive society.

Precise packet timestamping and synchronization are essential to temporally correlate captured information in different datacenter locations. This is key for visibility, event ordering and latency measurements in segments as telecom, power grids and electronic trading in finance, where order execution and reduced latency are critical for successful business outcomes. This contribution presents Precise Network Time Monitoring (PNTM), a novel mechanism for asynchronous Ethernet packet timestamping which adapts a Digital Dual Mixer Time Difference (DDMTD) implemented in an FPGA. Picosecond-precision packet timestamping is outlined for 1 Gigabit Ethernet. Furthermore, this approach is combined with the White Rabbit (WR) synchronization protocol, used as reference for the IEEE 1588-2019 High Accuracy Profile to provide unprecedented packet capturing correlation accuracy in distributed network scenarios thanks to its sub-nanosecond time transfer. The paper presents different application examples, describes the method of implementation, integration of WR with PNTM and subsequently describes experiments to demonstrate that PNTM is a suitable picosecond-level distributed packet timestamping solution. © 2013 IEEE.","FinTech; IEEE 1588; monitoring; Packet timestamping; visibility networks; White Rabbit","Electric power transmission networks; Electronics industry; Ethernet; Fintech; Visibility; Application examples; Distributed networks; Dual mixer time differences; Latency measurements; Packet timestamping; Pico-second precision; Reduced latencies; Synchronization protocols; Packet networks",,,,,"B-TIC-445-UGR18","This work was partially supported by national project AMIGA7 under Grant RTI2018-096228-B-C32 and by Andalusian project SINPA under Grant number B-TIC-445-UGR18.",,,,,,,,,,"Sanchez-Garrido, J., Jurado, A., Medina, L., Rodriguez, R., Ros, E., Diaz, J., Digital electrical substation communications based on deterministic time-sensitive networking over Ethernet (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 93621-93634; Molina-Masegosa, R., Gozalvez, J., Sepulcre, M., Comparison of ieee 802.11p and LTE-v2x: An evaluation with periodic and aperiodic messages of constant and variable size (2020) IEEE Access, 8, pp. 121526-121548; Choo, K.-K.-R., Yan, Z., Meng, W., Editorial: Blockchain in industrial IoT applications: Security and privacy advances, challenges, and opportunities (2020) IEEE Trans.

Second, this study examines the influence of perceived benefit, perceived risk and user trust on the intention to adopt Islamic Fintech. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of 350 was distributed among the respondents, while a usable sample of 321 was retained for the analysis. The study performed a self-administration survey to collect the sample data while the hypothesized model was tested using SmartPLS. Findings: The results revealed that perceived benefit and perceived risk were significant and positively influenced by their factors. Moreover, perceived benefits showed a positive and significant impact on trust. However, perceived risk had a negative and significant impact on trust. The results also found a strong positive and significant relationship between trust and intention to adopt Islamic Fintech. Originality/value: The outcome of this research may be used to develop strategies for Fintech and enables the financial sector to attain economies of scale in the world. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavior; Benefit; Financial services; Individual behavior; Information; Intention; Internet; Islamic Fintech; Risk; Sharia compliance; Trust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abramova, S., Böhme, R., Perceived benefit and risk as multidimensional determinants of Bitcoin use: a quantitative exploratory study (2016) Proceedings in International Conference on Information Systems 2016, pp. 1-20. , Dublin; Alaabed, F., Mirakhor, A., Accelerating risk sharing finance via FinTech: nextGen Islamic finance (2017) The 1st International Colloquium on Islamic banking and Finance, pp. 1-10; Alafeef, M., Singh, D., Ahmad, K., Influence of demographic factors on the adoption level of mobile banking application in Jordan research (2011) Journal of Applied Sciences, 6 (6), pp. 373-377; Ali, M., Raza, S.A., Service quality perception and customer satisfaction in Islamic banks of Pakistan: the modified SERVQUAL model (2017) Total Quality Management & Business Excellence, 28 (5-6), pp. 559-577; AliChin-Hong, M., Arif, I., (2015) Determinants of e-banking adoption: a non-users perspective in Pakistan; Ali, M., Raza, S.A., Puah, C.H., Amin, H., Consumer acceptance toward Takaful in Pakistan (2019) International Journal of Emerging Markets, 14 (4); Ali, M., Raza, S.A., Qazi, W., Puah, C.H., Assessing e-learning system in higher education institutes: evidence from structural equation modelling (2018) Interactive Technology and Smart Education, 15 (1), pp. 59-78; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of Fintech: a new post-crisis paradigm (2015) Geo.

As a consequence, organisations should bear this fact in mind and adapt their corporate strategies to the new market demands. Online social networks offer customers the possibility to bring attention to issues they believe need to be addresses by organisations. Added to this, e-reputation plays a pivotal role in determining a company's competitive advantage. This paper studies the role of e-communications in an organisation's strategy and how analytics and modelling techniques are used to take advantage of the digital media content. It discusses the historical reputational challenged experienced by banks and how can the current fintech industry take advantage of past errors. Finally, an overview of effective mechanisms to improve e-reputation is presented.

The relatively new emerging paradigms in various sciences, such as geometry (fractals), physics (quantum), and database systems (distributed ledger—blockchain), seem to potentially contribute to a greater shift in the framework of the finance industry, bringing also some concerns (cyber-threats). Consistent and extensive investigation of the reasonable potential impact of these new models (and their underlying technologies) is performed, and then tested through a SWOT analysis, as the main objective of this research. Threats and opportunities are always intrinsically driven by the introduction of technological advancements (revolutions). This research confirms that information availability and the increasing interconnection of crosswise applications of each discovery to the different fields of science is determining the rapid succession of revolutions identified by evident large shifts in economic paradigms. The growing computing capacity and the development of increasingly powerful predictive software are leading to a competitive, extremely dynamic, and challenging system. In this context, as shown by history, there is a high possibility of market concentration in which, however, only a few corporations—digital giants—can afford to develop these technologies, consolidating their dominance. © 2021 by the authors.

There has been a remarkable growth in RAs' assets under management (AUM) due to their ability to provide better expected return by being competitive on pricing, transparency, and services. The research paper is designed to explore the various experts in the financial industry (which includes VP and AVPs of investment bank, managers and senior executive at bank, IT professionals and executives, and FinTech entrepreneurs and CEOs) and perceive the digital disruption that is going to affect the traditional financial services industry. Secondly, it is to explore the various strategies that are being adopted by the financial service providers to withstand competition from the disruption caused by FinTech challengers. Moreover, the purpose of this research paper is also to understand the extent and effect of the disruption as well as the strategies adopted by financial industry players to face these disruptions from FinTech. © 2021 IGI Global.

Using daily data from November 2018 to June 2020, we use both DY (Diebold & Yilmaz, 2012) and BK (Baruník et al., 2017) to examine the volatility connectedness of returns series. The results of DY suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses. Second, Bitcoin, MSCIW, MSCI US, and KFTX are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas US dollar, oil, gold, VIX, green bond and green bond select are net receivers. Therefore, Fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio. Third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term. That is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility. Fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to Fintech, KFTX are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Equity and other prices; Fintech; Fourth industrial revolution; Green bonds; Portfolio diversification","Cryptocurrency; Fintech; Frequency domain analysis; Gold; Green manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Transmissions; Daily datum; Financial assets; Hedging instruments; High probability; Industrial revolutions; Shock transmission; Time and frequency domains; Volatility transmissions; Financial markets; automation; currency; equity; innovation; spillover effect; stock market; Matthiola incana",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abakah, E.J.A., Gil-Alana, L.A., Madigu, G., Romero-Rojo, F., Volatility persistence in cryptocurrency markets under structural breaks (2020) International Review of Economics & Finance, , volume and pages; Ahmad, W., On the dynamic dependence and investment performance of crude oil and clean energy stocks (2017) Research in International Business and Finance, 42, pp. 376-389; Ahmed, M.S., Alhadab, M., Momentum, asymmetric volatility and idiosyncratic risk-momentum relation: does technology-sector matter?

This paper attempts to shed light on its contributing factors, current state, economic impacts and potential risks. We identify three key drivers for China’s fintech development, namely shortage of supply in formal financial market, strong government support for promoting financial inclusion through digital technology, and more ‘tolerant’ regulatory environment. The greatest value of the Chinese fintech sector is promotion of financial inclusion, enabling a vast number of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and low-income households to access to financial services. Existing studies unveil some strong evidences of fintech development improving efficiency, increasing employment and supporting entrepreneurship. In the meantime, there are also serious challenges facing this sector, such as regulatory uncertainties, illegal transactions, data abuse, etc. We conclude the paper by presenting some key takeaways, including several lessons for financial regulation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; financial inclusion; financial stability; Financial technology",,,,,,"National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS: 18ZDA091, 19BJY252","Research for this paper was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China [No. 18ZDA091 and 19BJY252].",,,,,,,,,,"Aisaiti, G., Liu, L., Xie, J., Yang, J., An Empirical Analysis of Rural Farmers’ Financing Intention of Inclusive Finance in China: The Moderating Role of Digital Finance and Social Enterprise Embeddedness (2019) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 119 (7), pp. 1535-1563; Allen, F., Qian, J., Qian, M., Law, Finance, and Economic Growth in China (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 77 (1), pp. 57-116; An, J., Rau, R., Finance, Technology and Disruption (2020) European Journal of Finance, , https://doi.org/10.1080/1351847X.2019.1703024; Ayyagari, M., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Maksimovic, V., Formal Versus Informal Finance: Evidence from China (2010) Review of Financial Studies, 23 (8), pp. 3048-3097; Balyuk, T., Davydenko, S.A., (2019) Reintermediation in FinTech: Evidence from Online Lending, , Michael J.

This paper develops a perspective for critically understanding FinTech as a platform political economy that is marked by three distinctive and related processes: reintermediation, consolidation, and capitalisation. Through experimentation with the platform business model and building on the digital infrastructures and data flows of the broader platform ecosystem, a constellation of organisations–including start-ups, early-career firms, BigTech companies and incumbent banks–are engaged in processes of platform reintermediation. Changing the bases of competition in retail money and financial markets and encouraging oligopoly and even monopoly, the reintermediation processes of FinTech are presently manifest in strong tendencies towards platform consolidation. The imagined potential of FinTech has also triggered intensive processes of capitalisation, with platforms receiving significant prospective investment by venture capital, private equity funds, banks and BigTech firms. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","capitalisation; consolidation; FinTech; platform capitalism; reintermedation","capitalism; competition (economics); financial market; investment; monopoly; oligopoly; political economy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aitken, R., ‘All data is credit data’: constituting the unbanked (2017) Competition & change, 21 (4), pp. 274-300; (2018) Sochi accord for financial inclusion, , https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/2018-09/Sochi_FS18_AW_digital.pdf, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The Government evaluates the prospects of development of artificial intelligence technology, blockchain, big data in the area of budget, tax, customs and other relations by now. However, the development of the FinTech in Russia faces many problems. First of all, these is the absence of digital infrastructure for mining cryptocurrency, issues related to information security, the potential risks of illegal non-personalized transactions through the blockchain technology. It is necessary to analyze the content of the discovered institutional problems and to determine the ways to resolve them. The significant role in overcoming the difficulties is assigned to the Federal Law ""About the Digital Financial Assets"", which shall enter into force on the 1st of January 2021. Besides the foreign experience in overcoming the difficulties related to the utilization of FinTech is particularly valuable for Russia to solve the identified issues effectively. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; Budget control; Security of data; Artificial intelligence technologies; Digital infrastructures; Federal law; Financial assets; It technologies; Potential risks; Fintech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kim, Y., Choi, J., Park, Y.-J., Yeon, J., (2016) International Journal of Applied Engineering Research, 11 (2), pp. 1058-1061; Zilgalvis, P.V.V., (2014) Policy & Internet, 6 (4), pp. 377-392; Tsai, C.-H., Peng, K.-J., (2017) Asian Journal of Law and Society, 4 (1), pp. 109-132; Geranio, M., International Journal of Law and Technology, 112; Aksakov, A., The Expert Committee on Financial Market Will Define the Legislative Perspectives for the Usage of New Financial Technologies, , http://komitet212kmdumagovru/Novostiomiteta/item/14145821?filter%5Bmonth%5D=11&filter%5Byear%5D=2017; Cuccuro, P., (2017) International Journal of Law and Information Technology, pp. 1-17; (2017) ESMA the Distributed Ledger Technology Applied to Securities Markets Report, , https://wwwesmaeuropaeu/sites/default/files/library/dlt_report_-_esma501121423017-285pdf; Mainelli, M., Milne, A., (2015) Swift Institute Working Paper, 7; Malinova, K., Park, A., (2016) Market Design with Blockchain Technology Available from SSRN, , https://ssrncom/abstract=2785626; http://wwwrbcru/ekb/interview/01/11/2017/59f965499a794761acf47b30; Okashin, R., (2017) Within the Recurrent ICO Hackers Stole the Broadcast in Amount of $75 Million, Hi-tech, , https://wwwkasperskyru/blog/good-good-blockchain/18911/","Ponomareva, M.A.; Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, 49 Leningradsky Prospekt, Russian Federation; email: Ponomareva-m@mail.ru","Breskich V.Zheltenkov A.Dreizis Y.",,"EDP Sciences","2020 Topical Problems of Agriculture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, TPACEE 2020","25 November 2020 through 27 November 2020",,166123,25550403,,,,"English","E3S Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098862229

While both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often conceived as “green FinTech,” remains under‐determined. Therefore, this paper contributes to this important discussion about green FinTech by, first, synthesizing the relevant literature systematically. Second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis of the Swiss FinTech landscape both in terms of green FinTech startups as well as the services offered by the incumbents. The research results show that literature in this new domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated aspects of green FinTech and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic yet. In addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that green FinTech has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering customer‐to‐customer (c2c), business‐to‐customer (b2c), and business‐to‐business (b2b) services. Today the field is predominantly captured by startup companies in contrast to the incumbents whose solutions are still rare. © 2020 by the authors.

The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. These initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology. However, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy. Fintech offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This provides an opportunity to more closely examine fintech’s research challenges and trends. This study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research; (2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field; and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential. The novel proposal in this study includes theoretical contributions regarding financial technology. Using the systematic literature review approach of Kitchenham, in addition to thematic analysis, meta-analysis and observation to validate the quality of literature and analysis, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis fintech research from an information systems perspective, including the formulation of fintech technology concepts and their development. © 2020 by the authors.

The purpose of this study is to provide comprehensive data and evidence on value of the FinTech innovation event. First, a text-based filtering method for identifying FinTech patent applications is provided. Using machine learning applications, innovations are classified into major technology groups. The methodology for valuation of FinTech innovation is based on data of stock price changes. To assess the value impact, Poisson flow rates and stock price movements were combined. Further, to evaluate the effect of FinTech patents on the company’s value, a combination of CAR of patent application and Poisson intensities were used. Research findings provide evidence that FinTech innovations bring significant value for innovators and Blockchain being especially valuable. Such innovations as blockchain, robo-advising and mobile transactions are the most valuable for the financial sector. On one side of the spectrum, the financial industry can be affected more negatively by the innovation of nonfinancial startups that carry disruptive technology at their core. However, on the other side of the spectrum, market leaders who make significant investments in their innovations can evade most of these negative effects. This helped to form an overall view of FinTech innovations. © 2020 by the authors.

This research studies the role of using FinTech applications to build resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research empirically examines the factors affecting Jordanian citizens’ intention to use FinTech applications. The sample of the research comprised 500 potential FinTech service users in Jordan. Based on the research conceptual model, five hypotheses were developed and tested using structural equation modeling techniques (SEM-PLS). The research results indicate that perceived benefits and social norms significantly affect the intention to use FinTech applications. However, it has been found that perceived technology risks do not significantly affect the intention to use FinTech applications. Moreover, the results also indicate that customer trust is significantly mediating the relationship between perceived risks and intention to use FinTech applications. FinTech service providers should insure that their products are easy to use, fulfill needs and protect consumers’ data in order to ensure trust, hence positively influencing consumer adoption. © 2020 by the author.

The choice is disruption or collaboration. This study investigates the antecedents of fintech collaboration based on leadership styles and its consequence on competitive advantage. The study is a quantitative causality approach using a questionnaire to collect the data and use structural equation modelling to analyse it. There are 166 respondents, as samples, from 479 supervisors to directors of automotive, electronics, and food and beverage of medium and large companies. Results show that leadership styles have a positive effect on competitive advantage and fintech collaboration. This study's original value is that fintech collaboration is a necessity for managerial decisions as a mediator for competitive advantage based on leadership styles. It concludes that the primary antecedent choice in encouraging fintech collaboration is transactional leadership, and collaboration with the fintech entity to create a competitive advantage is necessary. Meanwhile, for further research, it is assumed that suitable leadership to encourage competitive advantage through fintech is transformational leadership, and collaborate with the fintech entity is a must. © The Author (s) 2020","Competitive Advantage; Fintech Collaboration; Leadership Styles",,,,,,,"The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Research and Technology / National Research and Innovation Agency of the Republic of Indonesia, who has provided grant funds for the multi-year research of this ""Fundamental Research"" scheme in 2020.",,,,,,,,,,"Al Hilaa, A.

Differentiated from the earlier Fintech evolution led by traditional financial institutions, “cross-sector” Fintech that operates at the intersection of financial services and information technology disrupts existing business models of banks while creating novel ecosystem dynamics. This study explores the Fintech ecosystem composition to understand better business model innovation based on underlying ecosystem dynamics while focusing on the specific role of cross-sector actors. These actors have escaped scrutiny despite being mature and experienced and having strong resource bases. Adopting a comparative case study method by considering the China-based Alibaba Group and Tencent, the study’s findings indicate that novel business model developments based on strong technological expertise and scale-based resources by cross-sector Fintech render a functional perspective on fast-developing Fintech industry less practical. Apart from cross-sector Fintech, investors constitute a new dimension in the conceptualization of the Fintech ecosystem. Overall, the interconnectedness of the cross-sector Fintech beyond the Fintech sectors drives the fuzzy boundaries between ecosystems, established business models, terminology definitions, ecosystem actors’ roles and relationships, which appear to become more heterogeneous and changeable over time. The study contributes to the scant literature on Fintech ecosystems and their sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

Moreover, it discusses the impact of those actor-level responses on the resilience of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), focusing on how they affect the diversity of and the connectivity among its actors. To address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has influenced the financial technology (FinTech) industry in London, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in London’s FinTech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies. Our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an EE. Moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms’ characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks. With regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms’ egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses. © The Author(s) 2020.","Brexit; entrepreneurial ecosystems; FinTech; institutional change; relocation decisions","decision making; entrepreneur; institutional framework; investment; stakeholder; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; Europe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acs, Z.J., Autio, E., Szerb, L., National systems of entrepreneurship: Measurement issues and policy implications (2014) Research Policy, 43 (3), pp. 476-494; Alvedalen, J., Boschma, R., A critical review of entrepreneurial ecosystems research: Towards a future research agenda (2017) European Planning Studies, 25 (6), pp. 887-903; Asheim, B.T., Isaksen, A., Regional innovation systems: The integration of local‚ ‘sticky’ and global‚ ‘ubiquitous’ knowledge (2002) The Journal of Technology Transfer, 27 (1), pp. 77-86; Auerswald, P.E., (2015), (,) Enabling entrepreneurial ecosystems: Insights from ecology to inform effective entrepreneurship policy.

Fintech companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to ‘big banks’, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor. For many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in Kenya, fintech is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid. While refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of fintech as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the Global North to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support. Through fintech, private citizens and groups in the Global North are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion. While fintech remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans. This paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through fintech are still distinguished largely by exclusion. In so doing, this paper highlights a theoretical position that refugee governance is embedded in racial forms of capital accumulation and expropriation. © The Author(s) 2020.","Fintech; Kenya; migration; neoliberalism; race; refugees","financial services; informal settlement; migration; neoliberalism; race; refugee; Kenya",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anzilotti, E., (2017), (,) Refugee camps are turning into permanent cities – can they be smart cities?, 17 July, 7; Aitken, R., ‘All data is credit data’: constituting the unbanked (2017) Competition and Change, 21 (4), pp. 274-300; Bauman, Z., (2004) Wasted Lives: Modernity and Its Outcasts, , 1st ed, Cambridge, Polity Press; Betts, A., Geervliet, R., MacPherson, C., (2018), (,) Self-reliance Kalobeyei?

FinTechs and TechFins have allowed the introduction of new services and changed the way customers interact to satisfy their financial needs. The FinTech landscape is constantly evolving in the market. Different business value propositions are entering the financial services industry, moving from increasing the user's experience to developing a time to market framework for banks to innovate products, processes, and channels, increasing the cost efficiency and looking for a “partnering on order” to lighten the regulatory burdens for banks. The many businesses of banks are changing their value chains, and banks' business models should do the same accordingly. Strategists could no longer take their value chains as a given; choices have to be made on what needs to be protected and maintained, what abandoned and the new on coming to make banks evolve and become more resilient in doing their job. Banking is shifting significantly from a pipeline, vertical paradigm, to open banking business models where open innovation, modularity, and ecosystem-based bank's business model may become the ongoing mainstream and paradigm to follow and develop. Opportunities and threats for banks are many and new ones to re-gaining their role in the market throughout a re-intermediation process. © Copyright © 2020 Omarini.","APIs; bank business model; digitalization; ecosystem; FinTech; open banking; platform; re-intermediation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adner, R., Kapoor, R., Value creation in innovation ecosystems: how the structure of technological interdependence affects firm performance in new technology generations (2010) Strat.

Firstly, we establish a single objective linear programming model with the percent of assets in products as the decision variables, the minimum-weighted duration as the objective, and the business requirements as constraints. Then, we select non-integer linear programming as the model solver by testing two algorithm solvers with six real test cases separately, according to the solving time. Finally, we directly compile the model and the algorithm program into a module to complete the deployment into a business platform to quickly complete the transformation of data and model the actual productivity of the bank. © 2020 by the authors.

The results reveal that large, middle-standing, and small and medium-sized enterprises focus on security, infrastructure, and user-related technology development, respectively, to enhance their innovation competencies. The security-related issues considered by large enterprises entail relatively high costs in initial technology development and are closely related to infrastructure building. Large enterprises are focused on developing overall security-related technologies, whereas middle-standing enterprises are striving to develop infrastructure-related technologies, with particular emphasis on elementary technologies. Small and medium-sized enterprises are also making efforts to develop user-centered technologies that can directly be used in fintech. As a method to implement regulatory sandboxes tailored to the needs of participating enterprises in South Korea, this study will help to determine the MoM of such participants and establish strategies to support them sustainably in terms of evidence-based policy. © 2020 by the authors.","Evidence-based policy; Fintech; Innovation competencies; MoM(micro-operating mechanism); Patents data; Regulatory sandbox; Type by enterprise","infrastructure planning; innovation; participatory approach; small and medium-sized enterprise; technological development; South Korea",,,,,"Science and Technology Policy Institute, STEPI: T0200600","Funding: The publication fee for this manuscript is funded by the Science and Technology Policy Institute (project number: T0200600).",,,,,,,,,,"Piri, M.M., The changing landscapes of fintech and regtech: Why the United States should create a federal regulatory sandbox (2018) Bus.

The article contributes to understandings of transparency as value cocreation in business-to-business markets. Through field-level discourse analysis, the article shows that transparency is contingent primarily on the nature of the market, in this case, a platformized industry, which valorizes transparency as part of a regime of data sharing and open access. Transparency is further contingent on the market actor: actors with lesser status and market legitimacy are more likely to seek to cocreate transparency with market actors of greater or similar status and legitimacy. The article concludes that in commercial spaces, publicity’s relationship to transparency is not only determined by market logic, but that all market logics are being drawn further toward a technological definition of transparency as “shareveillance,” as more segments of economic life become platformized. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","B2B content; digital marketing; discourse; fintech; transparency; value cocreation","article; discourse analysis; logic; marketing; mass medium",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbott, A., (1988) The system of professions, , University of Chicago Press; Athanassopoulou, P., Determining relationship quality in the development of business-to-business financial services (2006) Journal of Business-to-Business Marketing, 13 (1), pp. 87-120. , https://doi.org/10.1300/J033v13n01_03; Bernards, N., The poverty of fintech?

However, regulation of these new services faces a double challenge: to keep pace with innovation and facilitate new market entries while at the same time understanding and managing the regulatory risks that are involved. At this stage, the existing EU regulatory framework is of little help: the bulk of the present body of financial regulation stems from a different time, with different regulatory problems in mind. EU regulation is also very slow to change and to adapt. Therefore, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox""- an experimentation space - as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive. A sandbox would allow market participants to test fintech services in the real market, with real consumers, but under the close scrutiny of the supervisor. The benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market""cycle of financial innovation, while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection. At the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a technical field which is sometimes poorly understood, both for firms and for the regulator. This would help to reduce the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants. In the particular EU legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the EU Member States, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by EU institutions. This innovative approach would be somewhat uncharted territory for the EU, and thereby also contribute to the future development of EU financial market governance as a whole. © The Author(s), 2020.",,,,,,,,"82 European Banking Federation, supra, note 76, and Banking Stakeholder Group, supra, note 16.

As Fintech is innovative but inherently unpredictable, customers are still hesitant to adopt and use Fintech, which ultimately affects its growth. To achieve the sustainable development and growth of Fintech, an in-depth investigation of Fintech continuance intentions is required. To investigate continuous-use behavior in a Fintech context, this study focuses on two relevant issues: uncertainty and information technology (IT) quality. Uncertainty is more critical in Fintech than in traditional e-banking transactions because Fintech transactions are complicated and less predictable. IT quality is also crucial to Fintech success because IT plays a key role in Fintech transactions. This study mainly explores the relationship between uncertainty and IT quality, both of which significantly affect Fintech continuance intentions. For the purpose, we integrated an IT quality-based perspective with a trust-based model to investigate Fintech continuance intentions. Our results demonstrate that system quality is negatively related to perceived risk, whereas information quality is positively related to trust. Service quality is the most important quality factor for controlling uncertainty and encouraging continued use of Fintech. We found a more extended role of IT in Fintech than in other digital services. This study provides Fintech providers with the practical guidance in the design and implementation of Fintech innovation, thereby achieving the sustainable development of Fintech. © 2020 by the authors.","Fintech; Fintech continuance intention; Information quality; Perceived risk; Service quality; System quality; Trust","banking; information technology; perception; quality control; service quality; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Deng, X., Cheng, X., Can ESG indices improve the enterprises' stock market performance.

The study took place in the Palestinian context with a global comparison among these generations. The authors used the questionnaire-based technique to meet the study objective. West Bank respondents were selected for this purpose; the study instrument was distributed through different social media channels. The findings show that reliability/trust and ease of use are the main issues in using a financial service. Millennials are more aware (48%) of Fintech services than Gen Z (38%), which is different from the global view where Gen Z is the highest. The smartphone penetration rate is 100% among both generations, while the financial inclusion ratio in Palestine is around 36.4%; these clear indicators are the main Fintech drivers to promote Fintech services in Palestine, and these are global indicators for Fintech adoption intention. Both generations (84%) intend to use e-wallet services, Millennials (87%) and Gen Z is (70%) prefer using real-time services. Half of the respondents see that Fintech plays a complementary role with banks. The majority see that Fintech services are cheaper than bank services. Wealth management, and robot advisor services, and both generations are looking to acquire them in the long run. The authors revealed that 85% of respondents from both generations trust banks, so it is recommended that banks digitize their financial services to meet the customers' needs, considering that 90% of respondents see that promotions are a key issue in adopting Fintech services. Promoting e-wallet services by banks is highly recommended due to the massive rivalry with Fintech parties. © The author(s) 2020.","Artificial intelligence; E-banking; E-wallet; Fintech; Real-time",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Arner, D.

To overcome regulatory barriers of the fintech industry, regulatory sandboxes have been adopted. The regulatory sandboxes are beneficial to create a fintech ecosystem, but their effectiveness has not been empirically supported. This study aims to find the expected effects of regulatory sandboxes on fintech venture investments empirically. We conducted an analysis using a country-level comparative research method. To analyze it, we selected nine forerunning countries which have initially adopted regulatory sandboxes. For the purpose of validations, a comparative analysis and a regression analysis were conducted. In the results, we found that the adoption of regulatory sandboxes had very positive influences on the growth of the fintech venture investment. The results implied that regulatory sandboxes may play a vital role in increasing the influx of venture capital into the fintech venture ecosystem by removing regulatory uncertainty. The findings of this research contribute to providing the empirical evidences to policy makers in interpretations of the positive impact of regulatory sandboxes. © 2020 by the authors.","Financial innovation; Fintech; Investment; Regulatory sandbox; Venture; Venture capital",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) ASIC Regulatory Guide 257;, , ASIC: Brisbane, Australia; (2019) ASIC Fintech Regulatory Sandbox;, , ASIC: Brisbane, Australia; Blind, K., The influence of regulations on innovation: A quantitative assessment for OECD countries (2012) Res.

Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors review two Chinese entrepreneurial practices in the Fintech sector and low-speed electric vehicles (LSEV) and describe their stylized facts; second, they explore a possible theoretical LTM framework to underscore these practices; third, they make a connection between LTM and existing business models and analyze its significance and practical implications in business, in particular, in developing economies. Findings: The LTM business approach has helped Chinese companies in the Fintech sector and LSEVs gain global attention. The success factors of LTM for businesses are identifying a specific customer base, being aware of localization products and playing skillfully with regulations; the LTM approach has several overlaps with existing studies on niche products and base of the pyramid market. Originality/value: Based on some emerging and attractive business practices in China, this paper offers a valuable attempt to theorize them as long tail phenomenon. The LTM thesis provides a potential framework to reference for similar methods elsewhere and may illuminate entrepreneurship to be explored in similar markets. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fintech; Long tail markets; Low-speed electric vehicles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, C., The long tail (2004) Wired Magazine, pp. 170-177; Armendáriz, B., Morduch, J., (2010) The Economics of Microfinance, , 2nd ed., The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, and London; Baker, T.H., (2017) FinTech alternatives to short-term small-dollar credit: helping low-income working families escape the high-cost lending trap, , www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/mrcbg/publications/awp/awp75; Barzilay, O., Geva, H., Goldstein, A., Oestreicher-Singer, G., (2018) Equal opportunity for all?

Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study is qualitative in nature and utilizes semi-structured interviews at 14 African fintech firms. Findings: The study reveals that, during intra-Africa expansion, firms adapt their marketing strategies by working with local people, prioritizing customer education, creating personal relationships with customers, adapting their communication strategies and pricing strategies and using social media. The strategies that have been most effective involve including the community in the marketing process, prioritizing relationships, segmenting customers geographically, educating customers about products, using local distribution partners and having a flexible approach to strategy adaptation. Practical implications: It has been argued that technological innovation in Africa in areas such as financial services is a critical driver of its future development, because of the opportunity it presents to promote financial inclusion. Through an increase in venture capital investment on the continent, technological innovations in financial services have grown exponentially, and this study contributes to the understanding of the marketing strategies employed to gain market traction. Originality/value: This study proposes that African fintech firms adopt a bottom-up, value proposition-driven marketing strategy to successfully navigate the environment. The proposed framework provides a lens through which to understand the components of successful strategy adaptation in Africa, against the backdrop of the unique market challenges inherent in this emerging market continent. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Africa;

Various fintech services have a strategy to attract customers. One of the strategies is to offer promos to potential customers or early customers. Promos given to customers will provide maximum benefits when they use accurate type of promo on a promo provided by fintech services. Knowledge of various fintech services and a lot of promo information will provide an effective alternative for customers to use promos. For this reason, applications or software have been developed to provide information on various e-money and e-wallet services and promos. The method used is Lean UX which consists of 4 stages namely declare assumpts, Develop MVP, run experiments, feedback and user research. The result obtained on this research is a mobile androide application that can display fintech and promo information. Lean UX development is done with 2 iterations and produces features that are validly needed by the user but still need development in terms of User Experience. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Edison, H., Smorgard, N.M., Wang, X., Abrahamsson, P., Lean Internal Startups for Software Product Innovation in Large Companies: Enablers and Inhibitors (2018) J. of Sys. and SofT., 135, pp. 69-87; Karamanis, N., Pignatelli, M., Silva, D.C., Rowland, F., Cham, J.A., Dunham, I., Designing in Intuitive Web Application for Drug Discovery Scientist (2018) Drug Discovery Today, 23 (6), pp. 1169-1174; Nurdiani, I., Borstelr, J., Fricker, S.A., The Impact of Agile and Lean Practices on Project Constraints: A Tertiary Study (2016) Journal of System and Software, 119, pp. 162-183; Bjork, C., Integrating Usability Testing with Digital Rethoric in OWI (2018) Computers and Compotitions, 49, pp. 4-13; Peruzzini, M., Grandi, F., Pellicciari, M., How to Analyze the Workers Experience in Integrated Product Process Design (2018) Journal of Industrial Information Integration, 12, pp. 31-46; Zimmerman, J., Forlizzi, J., Speed Dating: Providing a Menu of Possible Future (2017) She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation, 3, pp. 30-50; Leung, A.K., Qiu, L., Thinking Trough Design is Creative Inspiring: The Why and How (2017) She Ji: The Journal of Design, Economics, and Innovation, 3, pp. 96-98; Larusdottir, M., Gullikson, J., Cajander, A., License to Kill-Improving UCSD in Improving Agile Development (2017) Journal of System and Software, 123, pp. 214-222; Brunnert, A., Krcmar, H., Continues Performance Evaluation and Capacity Planning Using Resource Profile for Enterprise Application (2017) Journal of System and Software, 123, pp. 239-262; Femmer, H., Fernandez, D.M., Wagner, S., Eder, S., Rapid Quality Assurrance with Requirements Smell (2017) Journal of System and Software, 123, pp. 190-213; Gothelf, J., Seiden, (2013) Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience.",,"Abdullah A.G.Suhartanto D.Widiaty I.AviastiAgustina I.H.Usman D.N.NugrahaRompas P.T.D.Warouw F.F.Basyarudin N.C.AndriyantoSumeruAbdullah C.U.Marham S.Alim N.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","3rd International Conference on Innovation in Engineering and Vocational Education 2019, ICIEVE 2019","26 November 2019",,160463,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Apart from traditional financial institutions which have been supervised according to strict regulations and standards technological development in financial services commonly called FinTech have introduced new trends providing fast peer to peer lending which directly matches lenders and borrowers thus putting more pressure to policymakers and supervisors. This paper presents potential implications of FinTech developments to financial stability, while explaining FinTech influence to market structure as well as benefits and risks of technologically driven financial innovations to financial stability. The paper stresses out an importance of international cooperation of regulators in order to preserve financial stability in the recent world of technological changes and innovations. FinTech has changed consumers' expectations and preferences while increasing the number of users expecting fast and easily accessible services available on mobile phones and other electronic devices. The paper shows that new technology provides the space for expanding financial services but it also poses additional risks to financial system in terms of microfinancial and macrofinancial risks. © 2020 Milena Vučinić, published by Sciendo.","financial innovations; financial stability; FinTech; market structure; technological developments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2019) BIS Annual Economic Report 2019: Big Tech in Finance: Opportunities and Risks, , https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2019e3.pdf; Brainard, L., (2018) Cryptocurrencies Digital Currencies*Distributed Ledger Technologies: What Are We Learning?, , https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20180515a.pdf, Remarks by Lael Brainard Member Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at the Decoding Digital Currency Conference Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Weller, C.E., Zulfiqar, G., (2013) Financial Market Diversity Macroeconomic Stability Working Papers wp332 Political Economy, , https://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_301-350/WP332.pdf, Research Institute, University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Claessens, S., Frost, J., Turner, G., Zhu, F., (2018) BIS Quarterly Review:Fintech Credit Markets around the World: Size,drivers and Policy Issues, , https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1809e.pdf; (2017) Distributed Ledger Technology in Payment, Clearing and Settlement, , https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d157.pdf, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures; (2017) FinTech Credit, Market Structure,business Models and Financial Stability Implication, , https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs_fsb1.pdf, Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB); Ernest, Young, (2019) Regulatory Technology (RegTech): Navigating the Right Technology to Manage the Evolving Regulatory Environment, , https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-regulatory-technology-regtech/$FILE/ey-regulatory-technology-(regtech).pdf; (2019) Report on the Impact of Fintech on Payment Institutions' and E-Money Institutions' Business Models, , Https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/2551996/32ff1cbb-a6c3-4a01-94f2-4d129386fa0a/EBA%20thematic%20report%20on%20the%20impact%20of%20FinTech%20on%20PIs%27%20and%20EMIs%27%20business%20models.pdf?retry=1, European Banking Authority; Fabris, N., Cashless society-The future of money or a Utopia?

This also applies to the financial sector of the economy. Since the mid-2000s, new fintech companies have entered the market. These companies are using new technologies to improve existing and create new financial services. In the course of their development, the interests of new market entrants often overlap with those of traditional participants, mainly banks. Investigation of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future. The research of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future. The article considers both aspects of competition and aspects of possible cooperation between financial market participants in a digital economy. The results of the scientific research demonstrate that cooperation will prevail over the competition. Probably existing financial institutions will reformat their architecture and become digital ones at the core. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Commerce; Sustainable development; Competition and cooperation; Digital economy; Digital technologies; Financial institution; Financial sectors; Financial service; Market participants; Scientific researches; Fintech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2018) Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech, Pulse of Fintech 2018, KPMG International (9 July, , https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2018/07/pulse-of-fintech-h1-2018.html, Accessed 15 Feb 2020; (2019) Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech, Pulse of Fintech 2019, KPMG International (30 July, , https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/campaigns/2019/07/pulse-of-fintech-h1-2019.html, Accessed 15 Feb 2020; (2019) Biannual Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech, Pulse of Fintech 2019 (31 July, , https://home.kpmg/ua/ru/home/insights/2019/08/pulse-of-fintech-h1-2019.html, Accessed 15 Feb 2020; (2019) Zachem Kitajskij Strahovshhik Ping An Insurance Investiruet $22 Mlrd.

It offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the key fintech-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and (ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of the regulatory enterprise as it exists today. This exercise reveals the fundamental tension at the core of the fintech problem. In the fintech era, the financial system as a whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and difficult to manage. The emerging regulatory responses to these macro-level changes, however, continue to operate primarily on the micro-level. Surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate fintech, this article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design. Against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of the fintech challenge- A nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively unified manner. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

These start-ups take on tasks and functions previously reserved for banks, such as financing, asset management, and payments. In this article, we trace the transformation of the industry after digitalization. By using data on FinTech formations in Germany, we provide first evidence that entrepreneurial dynamics in the FinTech sector are not so much driven by technology as by the educational and business background of the founders. Furthermore, we investigate the reactions of traditional banks to the emergence of these start-ups. In contrast with other emerging industries such as biotechnology, a network analysis shows that FinTechs have mostly engaged in strategic partnerships and only a few banks have acquired or obtained a financial interest in a FinTech. We explain the restraint of traditional banks to fully endorse the new possibilities of digitalized financial services with the characteristics of the technology itself and with the postponed fundamental decisions of banks to modernize their IT infrastructure. © Copyright © 2020 Brandl and Hornuf.","API; application programming interface; crowdfunding; financial industry; financial technology; FinTech; IT infrastructure; L86; M13; O16; O32; robo-advice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Awrey, D., Toward a supply-side theory of financial innovation (2013) J.

The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. The first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-KYC systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems. The third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments. The fourth pillar—design of digital financial markets and systems—supports broader access to finance and investment. Implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through FinTech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development. © 2020, T.M.C.

The FinTech industry employs a technology-based business model to provide financial services, including lending, payment, investment, and financing services. The study is motivated by endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain technology as the most important driver of economic growth. The study finds that FinTech startups are positively correlated with Indonesia’s economic growth. FinTech firms in their first year are found to be disruptive, but they fail to have serious consequences on Indonesia’s economic growth; however, they seem to significantly encourage economic growth in their second year. These findings are derived after accounting for other important growth determinants, namely, capital per labor, foreign direct investment (FDI), stock market development, and trade openness. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

However, until now, regulatory sandbox is still at the stage of manually submitting data, and artificial intelligence has not been applied to it. Hence, in this paper, we propose the framework of Parallel FinTech Regulatory Sandbox based on the ACP approach (Artificial systems + Computational experiments + Parallel execution). Then, we talk about how to combine the emerging blockchain technology with intelligent regulatory sandbox, thus solving problems such as poor data flow and regulation sluggish. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for the development of FinTech regulatory sandbox. ©2020 The Authors.This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.","ACP approach; blockchain; FinTech; regulatory sandbox; smart contracts","Artificial intelligence; Blockchain; ACP approaches; Artificial systems; Computational experiment; Data flow; Financial innovation; Parallel executions; Regulatory authorities; Fintech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Testing Fintech Products and Services without Holding An Afs or Credit Licence, , http://asic.gov.au/, Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC). ., Available online; Bai, T.X., Parallel robotics and parallel unmanned systems: Framework, structure, process, platform and applications (2017) Acta Automatica Sinica, 43 (2), pp. 161-175; (2015) Regulatory Sandbox, , https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/project-innovate-innovationhub/regulatory-sandbox, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ., Available online; Hu, B., Yang, H., The reference of British FinTech regulatory sandbox and China's realistic choice (2019) Economic Review Journal, pp. 103-114. , 11; Li, J.J., Transaction queuing game in Bitcoin blockchain (2018) 2018 Ieee Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), pp. 114-119. , Changshu, Suzhou, China; Li, L., Parallel testing of vehicle intelligence via virtual-real interaction (2019) Sci.

This paper uses mediating effect and moderating effect to test the influence path of rural residents' subjective and objective financial literacy on their financial decision-making with survey data from Henan and Anhui provinces in China. The results show that subjective and objective financial literacy have positive effects on financial market participation. Subjective and objective financial literacy have negative direct effects on insurance market participation. Subjective financial literacy plays an incomplete mediating effect in the impact of objective financial literacy on financial market and insurance market participation. Objective financial literacy is adjusted by subjective financial literacy on financial market participation and insurance market participation. At the same time, we introduce financial technology penetration as a threshold variable in the model and find that the financial literacy has stronger impact on financial decision-making if the financial technology penetration is above the threshold. © 2020 Yi Li et al.",,"Commerce; Decision making; Financial markets; Fintech; Empirical analysis; Financial decisions; Financial literacy; Insurance markets; Market participations; Mediating effect; Moderating effect; Rural residents; Engineering education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lusardi, A., Mitchell, O.S., Baby boomer retirement security: The roles of planning, financial literacy, and housing wealth (2007) Journal of Monetary Economics, 54 (1), pp. 205-224. , 2-s2.0-33847049934; Moore, D., (2003) Survey of Financial Literacy in Washington State: Knowledge, Behavior, Attitudes, and Experiences, , Pullman, WA, USA Social and Economic Sciences Research Center, Washington State University Technical Report 03-39; (2015) OECD/INFE Toolkit for Measuring Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion, , Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), Paris, France OECD Publishing; Xiao, J.J., Chen, C., Chen, F., Consumer financial capability and financial satisfaction (2013) Social Indicators Research, 118 (1), pp. 415-432. , 2-s2.0-84955581055; Dohmen, T., Falk, A., Huffman, D., Sunde, U., Are risk aversion and impatience related to cognitive ability?

For promoting the transformation and upgrading of finance, we select 2013-2019 data and construct a distributed lag model to analyse the important role played by green finance and financial technology in the construction of smart cities. In the paper, we find green finance promotes the construction of smart cities, and only it will not appear until nine months late. Financial technology has an opposite impact on the construction of smart cities, this is mainly because the research and marketization of financial technology are higher, and the cost is also higher.

Design/methodology/approach: Regression methodology was used to examine earnings management in the Fintech era. Findings: The findings show evidence for bank income smoothing using LLPs. There is greater income smoothing in the second-wave Fintech era compared to the first-wave Fintech era, and the presence of strong institutions did not lower income smoothing in the second-wave era. Bank income smoothing is also greater in (1) Bank of International Settlement (BIS) and EU countries than in non-EU countries and G7 countries, (2) well-capitalized banking sectors and (3) during economic booms in the second-wave Fintech era. Practical implications: The competition for loans and deposits by banks and Fintech lenders in the second-wave Fintech era created additional incentives for banks to engage in income smoothing to report competitive and stable earnings. Originality/value: The study uses a unique approach to detect country-level earnings management in the banking sector. Also, this study extends the bank earnings management literature by introducing the Fintech era as a determinant of the extent of bank earnings management. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking sector; Digital finance; Earnings management; Earnings smoothing; Fintech; Income smoothing; Legal quality; Loan loss provisions; Market power; Nonperforming loans; Regulatory quality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alt, R., Beck, R., Smits, M.T., FinTech and the transformation of the financial industry (2018) Electronic Markets Journal, 28, pp. 235-243; Aristei, D., Gallo, M., Loan loss provisioning by Italian banks: managerial discretion, relationship banking, functional distance and bank risk (2019) International Review of Economics and Finance, 60, pp. 238-256; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., 150 years of Fintech: an evolutionary analysis (2016) Jassa, (3), p. 22; Arner, D., (2016) FinTech: evolution and regulation, , https://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1978256/D-Arner-FinTech-Evolution-Melbourne-June-2016.pdf; Balla, E., Rose, M.J., Loan loss provisions, accounting constraints, and bank ownership structure (2015) Journal of Economics and Business, 78, pp. 92-117; Beatty, A., Liao, S., Financial accounting in the banking industry: a review of the empirical literature (2014) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 58 (2), pp. 339-383; Bouvatier, V., Lepetit, L., Effects of loan loss provisions on growth in bank lending: some international comparisons (2012) International Economics, (4), pp. 91-116; Bouvatier, V., Lepetit, L., Strobel, F., Bank income smoothing, ownership concentration and the regulatory environment (2014) Journal of Banking and Finance, 41, pp. 253-270; Bushman, R.M., Williams, C.D., Accounting discretion, loan loss provisioning, and discipline of banks' risk-taking (2012) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 54 (1), pp. 1-18; Cristini, M., Moya, R., Powell, A., (2001) The Importance of an Effective Legal System for Credit Markets: The Case of Argentina, , Bid (Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo), Bue Aires; Dapp, T., Slomka, L., (2015) Fintech Reloaded–Traditional Banks as Digital Ecosystems, pp. 261-274. , Deutsche Bank Research.

To identify them, we used the scenario approach. We determined three main development scenarios for the market of innovative financial technologies — “domination of traditional financial companies”, “segmentation of market of new financial technologies’, and “domination of digital financial companies” in terms of their probability and possible consequences for the global financial markets. The results of analysis allowed us to suggest that among main scenarios of fintech development the most probable is the splitting of existing market, which in the future can turn into a market of digital transnational financial corporations, which will squeeze out both small companies and traditional financial giants. However, although the scenario of capturing the financial market by large players is currently unlikely, it is certainly more important in terms of the consequences for global markets. The main prerequisite for the latter scenario is the promotion of international cooperation in the regulation of digital financial companies. Such a condition requires new models of country-level interaction in the regulation of innovative financial companies in order to address the risks and challenges of different scenarios of fintech development on global financial markets. This article includes a comparative analysis of digital development in Russia and the Republic of Korea, which is one of the key players on the Asian fintech market, as a possible benchmark that can be used to shape the policies of intergovernmental cooperation on global financial markets. These policies include 1) regulatory cooperation that reduces risks due to growing experience in the regulation of innovative financial companies; 2)cooperation in investments that allow one to acquire additional experience in regulatory practices and to develop infrastructure, which meets the new requirements of digital finance; and 3) cooperation in the taxation of fintech companies that reduces cross-border regulatory arbitrage. © 2020 by the authors.","Comparative analysis; Digital economy; Finance; Financial inclusion; Fintech; Global financial markets; International cooperation; Investment; Regulation; Regulation; Republic of Korea; Risks; Russian Federation; Scenario approach",,,,,,"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ: 20-010-00785","This study was carried out with the financial support of the Russian Foundation for Basic Research in the frame-work of the research project No. 20-010-00785 “Digital financial technologies as a factor in the development of the insurance market in the Russian Federation”.",,,,,,,,,,"Alcamo, J., Scenarios as tools for international environmental assessments (2001) Experts’ Corner Report, Copenhagen: European Environment Agency.; Ascencio, L., Trade and Competition in the Era of the Digital Economy.

The phenomenon of the development of peer-to-peer lending fintech companies in Indonesia is supported by the increasing demand of consumers. The research objective is to provide insight into the determinants of consumer interest in using fintech applications, using the technology acceptance model by added e-trust variables . The data analysis method used structural equation modeling with WarpPLS 6.0 software. Questionnaires were distributed to fintech consumers in Indonesia, with a total sample of 379 respondents. The results of this study indicate that the dimensions of e-trust contribute to determining the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude to adopt peer-to-peer lending fintech services, and intention to use peer-to-peer lending applications. © 2020.

Nevertheless, there is still ambiguity on the success of such disruptive technologies. To address this gap, this paper draws on a case study of an IT vendor in Japan. We interview key stakeholders involved in the case project to (i) explore the success factors of FinTech applications adopted by non-financial organisations, (ii) illustrate the applicability of the multi-dimensional project success framework in FinTech projects, and (iii) highlight the importance of the FinTech Project Management field that warrants further investigation. We contribute to the IT Project Management field, where we extend the theoretical background with aspects of FinTech adoption and success. We also inform practice in terms of lessons for managers to improve the existing processes and assist their organisations in business transformational initiatives using FinTech. © 2020, The Author(s).","Case study; FinTech; IT Project Management; Project success; Success factors","Project management; Business value; Case study approach; Disruptive technology; It project managements; IT vendors; Multi dimensional; Project success; Success factors; Fintech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Fintech and the Evolving Landscape: Landing Points for the Industry, , Accenture; Ahonen, J.J., Savolainen, P., Software engineering projects may fail before they are started: Post-mortem analysis of five cancelled projects (2010) Journal of Systems and Software., 83, pp. 2175-2187; Anda, B., Hansen, K., Sand, G., An investigation of use case quality in a large safety-critical software development project (2009) Information and Software Technology., 51, pp. 1699-1711; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, regTech, and the reconceptualisation of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business; Baskerville, R., Pawlowski, S., McLean, E., Enterprise resource planning and organisational knowledge: Patterns of convergence and divergence (2000) Proceedings of the Twenty First International Conference on Information Systems, pp. 396-406. , Association for Information Systems; Belanche, D., Casaló, L.V., Flavián, C., Artificial intelligence in FinTech: Understanding robo-advisors adoption among customers (2019) Industrial Management and Data Systems., 119, pp. 1411-1430; Benbasat, I., Goldstein, D.K., Mead, M., The case research strategy in studies of information systems (1987) MIS Quarterly, 11 (3), pp. 369-386; Bhattacharya, P.J., Seddon, P.B., (2011) Going beyond Operations with Enterprise Systems, , ACIS 2011 Proceedings; Bhattacharya, P.J., Seddon, P.B., Scheepers, R., Enterprise systems for innovation in products and processes: Beyond operational efficiency (2012) ACIS 2012: Location, Location, Location: Proceedings of the 23Rd Australasian Conference on Information Systems, 2012, pp. 1-11. , ACIS; Boyatzis, R.E., (1998) Transforming qualitative information: Thematic analysis and code development, , Sage Publications, Inc., Thousand Oaks; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Standard, B., (2000) Project Management Ð Part 3: Guide to the Management of Business Related Project Risk Association of Project Managers, , Bsi; Burtch, G., Ghose, A., Wattal, S., An empirical examination of the antecedents and consequences of contribution patterns in crowd-funded markets (2013) Information Systems Research, 24 (3), pp. 499-519; Burtch, G., Ghose, A., Wattal, S., Cultural differences and geography as determinants of online prosocial lending (2014) Mis Quarterly, 38 (3), pp. 773-794; Cao, L., Mohan, K., Xu, P., Ramesh, B., A framework for adapting agile development methodologies (2009) European Journal of Information Systems., 18, pp. 332-343; Chen, M.A., Wu, Q., Yang, B., How valuable is FinTech innovation?

In the case of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, we highlight the role of consumers’ distrust in banks. We offer evidence that distrust in banks likely triggers individuals to supply funding toward crowdfunding and away from bank deposits. We highlight that a distrust mindset promotes questioning default choices and considering alternatives, and fosters comparisons focusing on dissimilarities. Our findings suggest US states whose residents express greater distrust in banks are more likely to fund P2P loans and, conditional on funding, lend higher amounts. This relationship is more pronounced when funding small loans or borrowers with less banking access. © The Author(s) 2020.","crowdfunding; distrust in banks; fintech; peer-to-peer lending; technology adoption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agarwal, S., Amromin, G., Ben-David, I., Chomsisengphet, S., Evanoff, D.D., Predatory lending and the subprime crisis (2014) Journal of Financial Economics, 113 (1), pp. 29-52. , doi:10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.02.008; Aghion, P., Algan, Y., Cahuc, P., Shleifer, A., Regulation and distrust (2010) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 125 (3), pp. 1015-1049; Balyuk, T., (2019) Financial innovation and borrowers: Evidence from peer-to-peer lending.

Background An extensive number of studies found a significant relationship between Marketing knowledge management and bank performance (e.g., Akroush & Al-Mohammad, 2010; Hou & Chien 2010; Rezaee & Jafari, 2015; Veismoradi et al., 2013). However, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between marketing knowledge management (MKM) and bank performance (BP). Furthermore, the linkage between MKM and BP is not straightforward but, instead, includes a more complicated relationship. Therefore, it is argued that managing marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities can enhance performance via the role of financial innovation as a mediating factor on commercial banks; to date, however, there is no empirical evidence. Methodology Based on a literature review, knowledge-based theory, and financial innovation theory, an integrated conceptual framework has been developed to guide the study. A quantitative approach was used, and the data was collected from 336 managers and employees in all 13 Jordanian commercial banks using online and in hand instruments. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze and verify the study variables. Contribution This article contributes to theory by filling a gap in the literature regarding the role of marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities in commercial banks operating in a developing country like Jordan. It empirically examined and validated the role of Fintech innovation as mediators between marketing knowledge management and bank performance Findings The main findings revealed that marketing knowledge management had a significant favorable influence on bank performance. Fintech innovation acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Recommendations Commercial banks should be fully aware of the importance of knowledge man-for Practitioners agement practices to enhance their financial innovation and bank performance. They should also consider promoting a culture of practicing knowledge management processes among their managers and employees by motivating and training to promote innovations. Recommendations The result endorsed Fintech innovation's mediating effect on the relationship for Researchers between the independent variable, marketing knowledge management (assets and capabilities), and the dependent variable bank performance, which was not addressed before; thus, it needs further validation. Future Research The current designed research model can be applied and assessed further in other sectors, including banking and industrial sectors across developed and developing countries. It would also be of interest to introduce other variables in the study model that can act as consequences of MKM capabilities, such as financial and non-financial performance measures. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.","Bank performance; Fintech innovation; Marketing knowledge management","Commerce; Developing countries; Fintech; Human resource management; Industrial research; Knowledge based systems; Managers; Marketing; Personnel training; Conceptual frameworks; Financial innovation; Financial performance; Independent variables; Knowledge management process; Marketing knowledge; Quantitative approach; Structural equation modeling; Knowledge management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abir, M., Chokri, M., Dynamic of financial innovation and performance of banking firms: Context of an emerging banking industry (2010) International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 51, pp. 17-37. , https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286344704_Dynamic_of_financial_innovation_and_performance_of_banking_firms_Context_of_an_emerging_banking_industry; Akhisar, I., Tunay, K.

To solve this research objective, the authors analyze fintech development trends, especially the fintech application in the banking sector in Vietnam. To improve the quality of fintech services at banks, the authors conducted consideration of factors affecting customers' intention to use fintech services. To accomplish this, the authors collected data through a survey of 620 customers of the banks located in Ho Chi Minh City-the largest economic center in Vietnam. For the analytical method, the authors used multivariate regression to estimate the research model. Research results show that fintech service is very important for the banking sector in Vietnam. Moreover, this paper has achieved great success by identifying the factors that influence customers' intention to use fintech services. Accordingly, the intention to use fintech (INT) services is positively affected by the perception of usefulness (PU), social impact (SI), customer trust (TRU), and perceived ease of use (PEU). Based on the results of this study, bank managers will have a basis to improve the quality of fintech services. Not only that, the results of this study are also valuable for policymakers and researchers. © The Author(s).","Banking; Financial technology; Fintech; Intention; Vietnam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abbad, M.M., E-Banking in Jordan (2013) Behaviour & Information Technology, 32 (7), pp. 681-694. , https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2011.586725; Abrahao, R.D.S., Moriguchi, S.N., Andrade, D.F., Intention of adoption of mobile payment: An analysis in the light of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) (2016) RAI Revista de Administrando e Inovando, 13 (3), pp. 221-230. , https://doi.org/10.1016j.rai.2016.06.003; Akturan, U., Tezcan, N., Mobile Banking Adoption of the Youth Market (2012) Marketing Intelligence & Planning, 30 (4), pp. 444-459. , https://doi.org/10.1108/02634501211231928; Berger, A.N., The economic effects of technological progress: Evidence from the banking industry (2003) Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 35 (2), pp. 141-176; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?

This study is conducted quantitatively using monthly data from January 2016 to October 2018 and uses fintech as independent variable, proxied by fintech funding frequency and fintech funding value. Data transformation is conducted due to data volatility. The data of fintech funding, both frequency and value, is transformed into standardized fintech funding and growth of fintech funding. The data is obtained from Crunchbase, while the data of stock returns is obtained from Investing. This study further analyzes the data using Fama French Three-Factor Model and panel data regression. We found that fintech has no significant effect on retail banks' stock returns listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period of 2016-2018. The findings of the study provide some useful insights in understanding fintech companies' current position to retail banks in Indonesia. This study also suggests banking institutions, fintech companies, policy-makers, and others to take advantageous steps in building inclusive financial sectors. © The Author(s).","Fama french three-factor; Fintech; Panel data; Retail banks; Stock return",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agustiyanti, OJK Arranges Collaboration between Bank and Fintech (2016) Berita Satu, , http://id.beritasatu.com/home/ojk-atur-kolaborasi-bank-danfintech/143123, Retrieved October 2018, from; Bahri, S., Bank Mandiri Teams Up with KoinWorks and Amartha for MSME Funding (2018) KoinWorks, , https://koinworks.com/blog/kerjasama-bankmandiri/, Retrieved October 2018, from; MSME Credit Report (2018), https://www.bi.go.id/id/umkm/kredit/laporan/, Retrieved October 2018, from; Statistics of Electronic Money Payment Systems (2018), https://www.bi.go.id/id/statistik/sistem-pembayaran/uang-elektronik/contents/transaksi.aspx, Retrieved October 2018, from; (2016) World retail banking report, , https://www.febelfin.be/sites/default/files/InDepth/worldretailbankingreport2015.pdf, Retrieved October 2018, from; Chishti, S., Barberis, J., (2016) The Fintech Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries, , Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley; Chuen, K., Lee, D., Teo, E.G.S., Emergence of FinTech and the LASIC Principles (2015) Journal of Financial Perspectives, 3 (3), pp. 24-36. , https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2668049, EY Global FS Institute; Buckley, R., Arner, D., Barberis, J., The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm?

This article will briefly introduce Fintech as well as its development in Vietnam. Besides, the research also provided a survey on experts' opinions on the challenges to the promotion of Fintech application for the modernization of the banking-finance system in Vietnam. The survey results of 40 experts in banking with knowledge of Fintech identify five challenges faced by Fintech companies in Vietnam: (1) legal corridor; (2) infrastructure; (3) Fintech companies; (4) customers; and (5) human resources. From these five challenges/barriers, there are 14 detailed aspects. The results of the expert survey using descriptive statistics show that all five factors are assessed to be low and need to be better addressed in the future. The authors suggest several solutions for further development of Fintech to support the modernization of the banking-finance system in Vietnam: (1) quickly complete the regulatory framework; (2) introduce policies on tax exemption; (3) promote research and application of the benefits of block-chain technology; (4) utilize the abilities of the human resources; and (5) actively promote and popularize knowledge about Fintech. © 2020 The Author(s).","Banking-Finance system; Fintech; Fintech application; Vietnam",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Global FinTech investment growth continues in 2016 driven by Europe and Asia (2016) Accenture study finds, , https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-FinTech-investment-growth-continues-in-2016-driven-by-europe-and-asia-accenture-study-finds.htm, Retrieved January 10, 2020 from; (2016) FinTech and the evolving landscape, , https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-FinTechevolvinglandscape, Retrieved January 10, 2020, from; (2015) Innovation in payments: The future is FinTech, , https://www.bnymellon.com/_globalassets/pdf/our-thinking/innovation-in-payments-the-future-is-FinTech.pdf; Dang, H., Fintech: What should Fintech Startup in Vietnam do?

It is argued that disparities in record keeping regulation across communication mediums disincentivizes the use of technology capable of generating records for consumer retention, while incentivizing the use of technology which shields financial advisors from accountability. Experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument. Further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm. Objections to these arguments are considered, along with practical guidance for consumers, regulators, and policy makers. © Copyright 2020 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education, U.S.A.","communication;

Indeed, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-2030-ASD) and the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion (G20-HLP-DFI) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality. This paper investigates the interrelationship between FinTech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the Global Findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI. Highlights Harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality has been proposed by the UN and G20. We posit that FinTech affects income inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether the effects of FinTech differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We find that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality, at all quantile levels, primarily among higher-income countries. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","financial inclusion; FinTech; income inequality; quantile regression",,,,,,"ES/N013344/2; ES/P005241/1; AXA Research Fund, AXA","We acknowledge useful comments from participants at the Financial Inclusion and Fintech Conference at the School of Finance and Management, SOAS University of London, on 25–26 March 2019, in particular Gerhard Kling and Desire Kanga.

We find that knowledge generated in the IT sector is much more salient for fostering new fintech start-ups than knowledge generated in the financial services sector. Additionally, the importance of new knowledge created in the financial services sector (IT sector) increases (decreases) as fintech start-ups grow and seek financing. When the level of trust in financial services incumbents falls within a region, this is followed by an increase in the financing provided to fintech start-ups. Nevertheless, regions with historically low average levels of trust in financial services incumbents attract less fintech investment overall. © 2020, The Author(s).","Entrepreneurship; Fintech; Innovation; Knowledge spillovers; Trust; Venture capital",,,,,,"713279, CLNE/2018/202; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 681337, 825215; European Research Council, ERC","We acknowledge that this work has been supported by funding from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, the IRC and the EU Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 713279 (CLNE/2018/202) and the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 681337) - CityNet Project and Fintech Project grant No. 825215.

With 3,110 negative events and 467,594 transaction data of China’s peer-to-peer lending market from 2015 to 2018, this paper analyzes how different types of platform negative events affect the decision-making of individual investors. We find that individual investors only have a significant negative reaction to moral hazard exposure events such as platforms absconding, with relatively ignorance of other types of negative events. The negative effect is rapid but short-lived, and shows differences among platforms of different background and attributes. By the mediation analysis, we find that public attention can be a mediator and explain the pattern of the impact that absconding events have on individual investors. Related risk prevention, regulation, investor education issues are discussed and further suggestions are also put forward for both individual investors and regulators. © 2021 Universidad de Talca-Chile.","Mediation analysis; Negative events; Peer-to-peer lending; Platform absconding; Public attention",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akerlof, G.A., The market for lemons: Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) Journal of Economics, 84 (3), pp. 489-490; Akerlof, H., Oncu, S., The stock market reaction to extreme events: The evidence from Turkey, Journal (2006) International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 6 (6), pp. 78-85; Aouadi, A., Arouri, M., Teulon, F., Investor attention and stock market activity: Evidence from France, Journal (2013) Economic Modelling, 35, pp. 674-681; Armstrong, C.S., Barth, M.E., Jagolinzer, A.D., Market reaction to the adoption of IFRS in Europe (2010) Journal the Accounting Review, 85 (1), pp. 31-61; Bajo, E., Chemmanur, T.J., Simonyan, K., Underwriter networks, investor attention, and initial public offerings (2016) Journal of Financial Economics, 122 (2), pp. 376-408; Baker, H.K., Nofsinger, J.R., (2010) Behavioral Finance: Investors, Corporations, and Markets, , John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken; Barber, B.M., Odean, T., All that glitters: The effect of attention and news on the buying behavior of individual and institutional investors (2007) The Review of Financial Studies, 21 (2), pp. 785-818; Barberis, N., Huang, M., Mental accounting, loss aversion, and individual stock returns (2001) The Journal of Finance, 56 (4), pp. 1247-1292; Bauer, R., Cosemans, M., Eichholtz, P., Option trading and individual investor performance (2009) Journal of Banking & Finance, 33 (4), pp. 731-746; Cen, Y., Zhang, C., Wu, C., Media information and overtrading-An empirical Study on micro-blog posts, industry news and company announcements (2018) Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery, 2 (4), pp. 20-28; Chen, X., Cheng, Q., Lo, A.K., Is the decline in the information content of earnings following restatements short-lived?

The focus has now shifted from spread of the disease to the economic consequences it will bring to the society. The shortage of production will result into the shortage of supply and consequently will end as loss of jobs and employment for millions of people around the world. Two of the most important section of our society i.e., daily wage laborers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) will have to bear the major burnt of this crisis. The proposed integrated Artificial Intelligence and NLP based Islamic FinTech Model combining Zakat (Islamic tax) and Qardh-Al-Hasan (benevolent loan) can help the economy to minimize the adverse impact of COVID 19 on individuals and SMEs. Design/Methodology/Approach: The present study explores the possibility of Zakat and Qardh-Al-Hasan as a financing method to fight the adverse impact of Corona virus on poor individuls and SMEs. It provides the solution by proposing an Artificial Intelligence and NLP based Islamic FinTech Model combining Zakat and Qardh-Al-Hasan. Findings: The findings of the study reveals that Islamic finance has immense potential to fight any kind of situation/pandemic. Zakat and Qardh-Al-Hasan, if combined together can prove to be a deadly combination to fight the adverse effect of COVID 19. Practical Implications: To be used as an effective way to support individuals and SMEs in the period during and after the pandemic of COVID 19. Originality/value: There is no study combining Zakat and Qardh Al-Hasan to fight the adverse effect of poor individuals and SMEs. The study will contribute massively to the existing literature and will help the government and civil societies in fighting the economic impact of COVID 19 on individuals and SMEs. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Focusing on the IT-enabled value propositions across the fintech startups in our sample, we find that the startups tend to emphasize low-cost offerings that may pose a threat to incumbent business models in financial services. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Business model; Fintech; Information technology; Innovation","Ecosystems; Electronic commerce; Fintech; Information use; Active area; Business modeling; Business models; Financial service; Low costs; New York city; Value proposition; Costs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agerfalk, P., Fitzgerald, B., Outsourcing to an unknown workforce: Exploring opensourcing as a global sourcing strategy (2008) MIS Q, 32 (2), pp. 385-409; Amit, R., Zott, C., Creating value through business model innovation (2012) MIT Sloan Manag.

The Islamic FinTech area has been classified into three broad categories of the Islamic FinTech, Islamic Financial technology opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. Finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that Islamic Financial institutions can learn from the conventional FinTech organization across the world. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study collected 133 research studies (50 from Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 30 from Research gate, 33 from Google Scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of Islamic Financial Technology. The study presents the systematic review of the above studies. Findings: The study classifies the Islamic FinTech into three broad categories namely, Islamic FinTech opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. The study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/Blockchain is the biggest challenge which Islamic FinTech organizations are facing. During our review we also find that Islamic FinTech organizations are to be considered as partners by the Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI's) than the competitors. If Islamic Financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt FinTech and become partners with the FinTech companies. Practical Implications: The study will contribute positively to the understanding of Islamic Fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other FinTech users. Originality/Value: The study believes to contribute positively to understanding of Fintech based technology like cryptocurrency/Blockchain from sharia perspective. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper we evolve possible approaches of FinTech legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels. Document analysis, as a form of qualitative research, was used in this study. Findings: We found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address fintech companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and fintech operators. In our opinion, no specific legislation for FinTech companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc. Practical Implications: The term FinTech is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally. According to international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD, FinTech offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries. Some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for FinTech and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment. Originality/Value: There is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of FinTech among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area. The value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of FinTech by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

It is because of the high financing needs of the people who have not been reached by the banks. The existence of lending fintech is getting stronger with the issuance of the Financial Service Authority Regulation Number 77 of 2018 concerning Information Technology-Based Money Lending and Borrowing Services. Until August 2019, there were 127 lending fintech registered in the Financial Service Authority. Unfortunately, there is still a problem concerning protecting consumers who make loan transactions with fintech companies, along with the rise of illegal fintech companies. Therefore, this paper tries to analyze the potential development of lending fintech in Indonesia, along with its opportunities and challenges. The study of this research uses normative juridical. This paper concludes that the current regulation is still not enough in providing legal protection to consumers in conducting the transaction in lending fintech. Therefore, it is necessary to make a comprehensive regulation that regulates this so that public trust in the lending fintech company is higher. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Fintech; Current regulations; Financial service authorities; Indonesia; Legal protection; Public trust; Consumer protection",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2019) Daftar Perusahaan Fintech, , OJK; (2019) Siaran Pers No. SP 06/IX/SWI/2019 Satgas Temukan 123 Fintech Ilegal, 30 Gadai Swasta Dan 49 Entitas Penawaran Investasi Tanpa Izin, , https://www.ojk.go.id/id/berita-dan-kegiatan/siaran-pers/Pages/Siaran-Pers-Satgas-Temukan-123-Fintech-Lending-Ilegal,-30-Gadai-Swasta-dan-49-Entitas-Penawaran-Investasi-Tanpa-Izin.aspx, OJK; Reily, M., (2019) YLKI: Layanan Jasa Keuangan Catat Aduan Konsumen Terbanyak di 2018 Artikel Ini Telah Tayang di Katadata.co.id Dengan Judul 'Ylki: Layanan Jasa Keuangan Catat Aduan Konsumen Terbanyak di 2018, , https://katadata.co.id/berita/2019/01/25/ylki-layanan-jasa-ke, katadata; Jakarta, L.B.H., (2018) Terjerat Pinjaman Online, 1330 Korban Mengadu Ke LBH Jakarta, , https://www.bantuanhukum.or.id/web/terjerat-pinjaman-online-1330-korban-mengadu-ke-lbh-jakarta/; Jakarta, L.B.H., (2019) Regulasi Tidak Melindungi Masyarakat, Pinjaman Online Pertaruhkan Nyawa, , https://www.bantuanhukum.or.id/web/regulasi-tidak-melindungi-masyarakat-pinjaman-online-pertaruhkan-nyawa/; Indonesia, P., (2019) Indonesia ' S Fintech Lending : Driving Economic Growth Through Financil Inclusion; Thomas, P., (2016) The Fintech Opportunity; Schueffel, P., Taming the Beast: A Scientific Definition of Fintech (2017) J.

Indian Government has been trying hard to provide financial services to the people who don't have access to these services through 'Digital Drive-, which was partially successful. But still large number of rural people especially farmers depends on traditional credit system. Presently to support farmer technologically Agri- tech is providing services. Fin-tech provides financial service to all the sectors, but there is no impact on farming sector for providing credit facilities. So the farmers are more dependent on the private lenders for loans with high interest rates for their farming needs. But due to this repayment of loan with high interest has become huge burden and is leading to suicides and deaths. The aim of the paper is to analyze the fin- tech in Agri sector and its impact in helping the farmers to fulfill their needs to lesser their burdens. This helps farmers to overcome the situations and sustain to the changes in the market. © 2019 by Advance Scientific Research.","Agri-Tech; Agriculture sector; Fin- tech; Financial services; Technological challenges",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Gupta, A., Enabling business of agriculture via new financing technologies (2018) Journal of Agriculture and Allied Sciences, , July; Gandhi, V.P., Growth and transformation of the agribusiness sector: Drivers, models and challenges (2014) Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics; Kumar, D., Agriculture credit reform and financial inclusion in India (2014) International Journal of Business Quantitative Economic Applied Management Research, , September; Solanki, R., A study of agricultural finance by commercialbanks in India: A case study of Central Bank of India (2016) Abhinav National Monthly Refereed Journal of Research in Commerce & Management; https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/305564; https://nextbillion.net/can-next-generation-startups-unite-agritech-and-fintech-for-farmers-in-emerging-markets/; https://agfundernews.com/agtech-startups-fintech.html/; https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/india-crops-agriculture-radha-mohan-singh-4389510/; https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/15610/5-ways-the-fintech-industry-will-support-farming; https://www.business-standard.com/article/finance/banks-fund-agricultural-technology-companies-for-rural-lending-118060900031_1.html; https://unitus.vc/updates/can-fintech-entrepreneurs-save-indias-farmers/; https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/economic-survey-emphasis-on-women-farmers-for-rural-transformation/articleshow/62693042.cms; https://enam.gov.in/; http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/rap/files/uploads/ESF_Presentations/E-Agriculture_Strategy.pdf; Ari Kristina, S., Permitasari, N.P.A.L., Knowledge, attitudes and barriers towards human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in developing economies countries of South-East Asia region: A systematic review (2019) Systematic Reviews in Pharmacy, 10 (1), pp. 81-86. , Print; Zhang, W., Liu, H., Al-Shabrawey, M., Caldwell, R., Caldwell, R., Inflammation and diabetic retinal microvascular complications (2011) Journal of Cardiovascular Disease Research, 2 (2), pp. 96-103",,,,"Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

As a result of its consistent growth new terms have been introduced in this domain. The term 'FinTech' is one such terminology. This term is used for describing various operations that are being frequently employed in the financial technology sector. These operations are usually practiced in enterprises or organizations and provide requested services by using Information Technology based applications. The term does take into account various other sensitive issues, like, security, privacy, threats, cyber-attacks, etc. This is important to note that the development of FinTech is indebted to the mutual integration of different state of the art technologies, for example, technologies related to a mobile embedded system, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing, big data, data analytics techniques, and cloud computing etc. However, this technology is facing several security and privacy issues that are much needed to be addressed in order to improve the acceptability of this new technology among its users. In an effort to secure FinTech, this article provides a comprehensive survey of FinTech by reviewing the most recent as well as anticipated financial industry privacy and security issues. It provides a comprehensive analysis of current security issues, detection mechanisms and security solutions proposed for FinTech. Finally, it discusses future challenges to ensure the security and privacy of financial technology applications. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber security; FinTech; fraud detection; Internet of Things; privacy; security; threats","Crime; Data Analytics; Data privacy; Internet of things; Mobile cloud computing; Network security; Surveys; Comprehensive analysis; Cyber security; Fraud detection; security; Security and privacy issues; State-of-the-art technology; Technology based applications; threats; Fintech",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, Y., Yu, R., Xie, S., Yao, W., Xiao, Y., Guizani, M., Home M2M networks: Architectures, standards, and QoS improvement (2011) IEEE Commun.

To address this gap, this paper aims to understand the evolution of the FinTechs ecosystem, through a socio-technical system theory and service innovation lense. A case study research methodology was used, in which 6 Brazilian and 5 Portuguese FinTechs were analyzed. Primary data was collected using semi-structured interviews with managers and employees of the startups, while secondary data was obtained through the analysis of reports from consulting firms and public relations materials of the startups. Results show the evolution of FinTech ecosystems from the perspective of socio-technical system theory and service innovation. From the socio-technical system perspective it was possible to understand the roles of social, technological and organizational actors in the evolution of these ecosystems. From the service innovation perspective, it was possible to understand the dynamics of the evolution of the FinTech ecosystems and its results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","FinTech; FinTech ecosystem; Process innovation; Service innovation; Social-technical theory","Fintech; Human resource management; Public relations; System theory; Case study research; Ecosystem evolution; Organizational actors; Process Innovation; Semi structured interviews; Service innovation; Social-technical theory; Sociotechnical systems; Ecosystems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Puschmann, T., Fintech (2017) Bus.

The Internet of things will be a new normal, dedicated to unlocking human potentials. The purpose of this study is to analyze the feasibilities and challenges of the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries. To this end, a survey was conducted on a sample of 60 small and medium industries. It was revealed that the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries did not seem ready to be achieved due to the limitations in technology infrastructure, data and information, human resources and policy. Therefore, improvement to these factors should be made to realize the human-centered and technology-based society. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Data and information; Financial capital; Human potential; Technology infrastructure; Technology-based; Physics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Buchak, G., Matvos, G., Piskorski, T., Seru, A., Fintech, regulatory arbitrage, and the rise of shadow banks (2018) J.

FinTech and the integration of FinTech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, SDG 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social SDGs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources. Important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that FinTech holds in this context. Mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building.

Due to the wide adoption of IT, various FinTech applications are used by financial industry to help process information and offer financial services. Traditionally, textual passwords are the most widely deployed authentication mechanism, while having many known limitations. As a result, there is a need to enhance the security of FinTech authentication against cyber-criminals. As an alternative, graphical passwords (GPs) are considered as one promising solution to complement traditional password-based systems. In the literature, various GP schemes were proposed such as PassPoints, DAS, Cued Click Points, GeoPass, etc. In this work, we identify that multiple password inference has become a challenge for most GP schemes, and thus design RouteMap, a map-and route-based GP to further improve the security of FinTech applications. This scheme requires users to create a route on a world map as their credentials. In the evaluation, we involved a total of 120 participants, among which 60 of them have financial (FinTech) background, and investigated the performance of RouteMap by comparing it with two similar schemes. Our results demonstrate that participants can achieve better performance using RouteMap in the aspects of both authentication accuracy and multiple password memory. Our effort attempts to complement existing studies and stimulate more research on the combination of GP and FinTech. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","FinTech application; Graphical passwords; Map passwords; Multiple password inference; Security and usability; User authentication","Finance; Maps; Authentication mechanisms; Financial industry; Graphical password; Multiple password inference; Password-based systems; Process information; Security and usabilities; User authentication; Authentication",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 830929","The authors would like to thank all participants for their hard work and cooperation in the user study.

In this study, based on the weighted least squares (WLS) and threshold regression methods of cross-sectional data, we empirically examine the impact of FinTech development on agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, a major cause of impaired surface water quality. Our results show that there is an inverted “U” shape relationship between the development of FinTech and agricultural NPS pollution. That is, after crossing a “threshold value”, the level of FinTech development can curb agricultural NPS pollution. At the structural level, the availability of FinTech services, the FinTech infrastructure, and the agricultural NPS pollution also have an inverted “U” shape relationship. At the threshold effect, in the developing stage of an agricultural economy, the overall level of FinTech development, the use of FinTech services, the availability of FinTech services, and the FinTech infrastructure have an inverted “U” shape relationship with agricultural NPS pollution. On the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the impact of FinTech development and its structure on agricultural NPS pollution is insignificant. Hence, we can conclude that FinTech development can help reduce agricultural NPS pollution in under-developed regions. However, due to the fact that a “U” shape relationship always exists between FinTech service quality and agricultural NPS pollution, the quality of FinTech service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural NPS pollution more effectively. © 2019 by the authors.

The adoption of this technology by FinTech companies constitutes the next step towards the expansion of blockchain and its sustainability. The paper conducts a mapping study on the research topics, limitations, gaps and future trends of blockchain in FinTech companies. A total of 49 papers from a scientific database (Web of Science Core Collection) have been analyzed. The results show a deep focus in challenges such as security, scalability, legal and regulatory, privacy or latency, with proposed solutions still to be far from being effective. A vast majority of the research is focused into finance and banking sector, obviating other industries that could play a crucial role in the further expansion of blockchain. This study can contribute to researchers as a starting point for their investigation, as well as a source for recommendations on future investigation directions regarding blockchain in the FinTech sector. © 2019 by the authors.","Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; FinTech; Mapping study; Technological challenges","banking; mapping method; sustainability; technological development",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nakamoto, S., (2008) Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, , https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf, accessed on 25 February 2019; Tschorsch, F., Scheuermann, B., Bitcoin and beyond: A technical survey on decentralized digital currencies (2015) IEEE Commun.

However, relevant studies are rare and there is no consensus on the optimal indicator system for sustainable development. Therefore, this study proposes an indicator system to evaluate sustainability and conducts in-depth analysis of the relationship between FinTech and sustainable development based on data of peer-to-peer platforms (P2P) in 31 Chinese provinces. The empirical results show the existence of a U-shaped relationship between FinTech and sustainable development, mainly determined by the pattern of extensive economic growth. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis indicates that there are significant regional differences in its impact on sustainable development, being significant in China's eastern and central regions and insignificant in the western region; moreover, the impact on the central region is significantly higher than that on the eastern region. Our research not only has strong practical significance but also contributes significantly to the literature on FinTech and sustainable development. © 2019 by the authors.","Consumption emission; Economic growth; Environmental governance; Financial technology; Peer-to-peer; Social development; Sustainable development","economic growth; empirical analysis; environmental economics; environmental legislation; financial system; heterogeneity; literature review; optimization; social development; sustainability; sustainable development; China",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71473169, 71673194, 71742004; Sichuan University, SCU; Graduate Student's Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University: 2018YJSY001","Funding: This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant Nos. 71742004, 71673194, and 71473169 for D.X. and the Graduate Student’s Research and Innovation Fund of Sichuan University, Grant No.2018YJSY001 for C.X.

After identifying firms that are considered financial technology, the authors collect innovation outcomes such as patents and data breaches associated with those firms. The authors show that patent activity has enjoyed modest growth year over year; however, firms still have challenges to overcome such as market risk and data security. This study serves as a perspective on financial technology. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Data breach; Data security; Financial innovation; Financial technology; Innovation; Patents",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cai, W., Wang, Z., Ernst, J.B., Hong, Z., Feng, C., Leung, V.C., Decentralized applications: The blockchain-empowered software system (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 53019-53033; Cefis, E., Marsili, O., Survivor: The role of innovation in firms’ survival (2006) Research Policy, 35 (5), pp. 626-641; Coad, A., Rao, R., Innovation and firm growth in high-tech sectors: A quantile regression approach (2008) Research Policy, 37 (4), pp. 633-648; Ederer, F., Manso, G., Is pay for performance detrimental to innovation?

We use e-payment index introduced by RMIT University and TRPC and apply quantile regression with GME approach. We consider the quantile level at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. At the low level of economic development variables, the Fintech have the highest effects on these variables compared with the medium and high level of economic development. In other words, Fintech supports not only low level of growth and productivity but also reduce the low level of price volatility and income inequity. Further investigation provides that e-payment usage and technology empowerment are helpful to economic development, particularly, increasing in growth and productivity. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The methodology adapted in this paper is qualitative secondary research case study method. The study undertook a literature review analysis where the literature of more than fifty research papers and reports were analyzed and themes were generated. Hence twelve such themes evolved and then thematic content analysis was executed through grounded theory method. The reliability of the data source mentioned were taken from relevant organizations involved in cross border payments and validation of the reports were done by experts in this field of financial ecosystem. SWIFT still enjoys monopoly in the market in terms of its huge network and the number of banks it partners across 200 + countries in the world. But the new block chain technology launched by Ripple and Bitcoin and other small start-ups has posed a challenge to the existing traditional cross border payment system of SWIFT. Block chain has a peer-to-peer communication with no intermediary network required. It involves a simple transaction charge with the flexibility to share documents over network for better transparency. But SWIFT having a legacy incredibility and trust can ensure more reliable services to the businesses in cross border payments. © BEIESP.","Digital payment; Incredibility; Monopoly; SWIFT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Young, G.O., Synthetic structure of industrial plastics (Book style with paper title and (1964) Plastics, 3, pp. 15-64. , 2nd ed., J.

To analyze the role of fintech in the national economy, we first broaden its definition and compare its economic performance using three methodologies-Demand-driven model, Supply-driven model and industry linkage effect in interindustry analysis. We find that the fintech industry has a stronger effect on production inducement. Regarding industry linkage effects, fintech ranked the top in all 31 industries for the forward linkage effect and 22 for the background linkage effect-much higher than the traditional financial industry. This implies that the fintech industry is effective as the intermediate good with national demand as well as the final good. Particularly, this industry plays the roles of intermediate and final goods across almost all industries. That is, fintech could better promote overall national economic performance as a platform industry. Because most businesses within the fintech industry depend on innovation through the integration of finance and information technology, we find that fintech can feasibly prompt the fourth industrial revolution. Nonetheless, this industry is characterized by excessive regulations in Korea, indicating the need for negative regulation for new, innovative businesses within the fintech industry that would critically emphasize innovativeness for inclusive, sustainable economic growth. © 2019 by the authors.","Exogenous specification; Fintech; Innovation; Input-output analysis; Sustainable growth","demand analysis; economic conditions; economic growth; finance; information technology; innovation; input-output analysis; national economy; sustainability; Korea",,,,,"Inha University, Inha","Funding: Inha University Research Fund supported this work.",,,,,,,,,,"Basole, R.C., Patel, S.S., Transformation through unbundling: Visualizing the global FinTech ecosystem (2018) Serv.

It is argued that situating this emergent ‘turn to technology’ in the context of a longer-running pattern of failed efforts to promote the development of financial markets for the poor in the Global South offers us a useful lens on the dynamics of neoliberalism. The article develops this analysis by drawing together interlinked discussions of ‘neoliberal reason’, highlighting the central role played by the diffusion of market institutions in neoliberal projects with Marxian discussions highlighting the crucial underlying role of labour in enabling the operation of markets. In this context the appeal to ever-more fine-grained information with which to allocate credit underlying the turn to technology can both be read as yet another attempt to ‘re-engineer’ the market, and also seen as a doomed project. Empirically, this argument is fleshed out through an engagement with key framework documents around financial inclusion and technology from the World Bank and G20. © The Author(s) 2019.","development; financial inclusion; Fintech; markets; neoliberalism; poverty","European Union; financial market; governance approach; neoliberalism; poverty; World Bank",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2010), Seoul: G20; (2011), https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/afi_maya_quick_guide_withoutannex_i_and_ii.pdf, (,) A quick guide to the Maya Declaration on Financial Inclusion. :, (accessed 2 July 2019; (2018), https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/2018-09/Sochi_FS18_AW_digital.pdf, (,) Sochi Accord: Fintech for financial inclusion. :, (accessed 2 July 2019; Aitken, R., The financialization of microcredit (2013) Development and Change, 44 (3), pp. 473-499; Aitken, R., ‘All data is credit data’: Constituting the unbanked (2017) Competition & Change, 21 (4), pp. 274-300; Arráiz, I., Bruhn, M., Stucchi, R., (2015), (, a) Psychometrics as a tool to improve screening and access to credit.

Previous critical accounts have often linked the development of fintech to processes of financialization. However, these arguments rarely take account of the uneven and highly limited character of ‘financial inclusion’ in practice. Drawing on engagements with science and technology studies and historical materialist political economy, this article advances an approach emphasizing processes of abstraction from productive activities, mediated through particular infrastructures, as core elements of financial accumulation. Seen in this light, psychometrics in particular and alternative credit data more broadly can be seen as flawed efforts to confront three sets of limits—(1) the necessarily reductive character of abstract framings, and the consequent challenges posed by their encounter with complex processes in practice, (2) the ways that systems for credit scoring interact with the infrastructures of existing financial systems, and (3) the difficulty of realizing financial profits in the context of widespread precarious livelihoods. Looking at alternative forms of credit data from this angle offers a way of grasping the truncated and uneven rollout of fintech, and hence of prompting more critical reflections about the limits to processes of financialization. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","credit scoring; Financial inclusion; financialization; historical materialism; psychometrics; science and technology studies; technology",,,,,,"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC: 756-2016-0297","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, Postdoctoral Fellowship 756-2016-0297.

Using data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify innovations by their underlying technologies. We find that most FinTech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable. For the overall financial sector, internet of things (IoT), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types. Innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

First, it is argued that the question that preoccupies ‘coherentists’ (concerning the application of the law of contract to smart contracts, and the fit between smart contracts and the paradigmatic ‘fiat contracts’ that are recognised by the law of contract) is neither as puzzling nor as important as might be supposed. Secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a ‘regulatory-instrumentalist’ nature; in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set. Thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had. Blockchain is a potentially transformative technology and it is important to have more fundamental conversations about the kind of community that we want to be. © 2019, The Author(s).","Blockchain; Coherentism; Contract law; Regulatory-instrumentalism; Smart contracts; Technological management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Adams, J.N., Brownsword, R., (2007) Understanding contract law, , 5, Sweet and Maxwell, London; Adams, J.N., Beyleveld, D., Brownsword, R., Privity of contract—the benefits and the burdens of law reform (1997) Mod Law Rev, 60, pp. 238-264; Bayern, S., Burri, T., Grant, T.D., Häusermann, D.M., Möslein, F., Williams, R., Company law and autonomous systems: a blueprint for lawyers, entrepreneurs, and regulators (2017) Hast Sci Technol Law J, 9, pp. 135-162; Beyleveld, D., Brownsword, R., (2001) Human dignity in bioethics and biolaw, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brincker, M., Privacy in public and the contextual conditions of agency (2017) Privacy in public space, pp. 64-90. , Timan T, Newell BC, Koops B-J, (eds), Edward Elgar, Cheltenham; Brownsword, R., Code, control, and choice: why east is east and west is west (2005) Legal Stud, 25, pp. 1-21; Brownsword, R., (2008) Rights, regulation and the technological revolution, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brownsword, R., Contracts in a networked world (2012) Commercial contract law: transatlantic perspectives, pp. 116-145. , Matteo L, Zhou Q, Saintier S, Rowley K, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., Whither the law and the law books: from prescription to possibility (2012) J Law Soc, 39, pp. 296-308; Brownsword, R., Human dignity, human rights, and simply trying to do the right thing (2013) Understanding human dignity, pp. 345-358. , McCrudden C, (ed), The British Academy and Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brownsword, R., Regulatory coherence—a European challenge (2014) Varieties of European economic law and regulation: essays in honour of Hans Micklitz, pp. 235-258. , Purnhagen K, Rott P, (eds), Springer, Dordrecht; Brownsword, R., Crimes against humanity, simple crime, and human dignity (2014) Humanity across international law and biolaw, pp. 87-114. , Beers B, Corrias L, Werner W, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., Human dignity from a legal perspective (2014) Cambridge handbook of human dignity, pp. 1-22. , Duwell M, Braavig J, Brownsword R, Mieth D, (eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., In the year 2061: from law to technological management (2015) Law Innov Technol, 7, pp. 1-51; Brownsword, R., Technological management and the rule of law (2016) Law Innov Technol, 8, pp. 100-140; Brownsword, R., The E-Commerce Directive, consumer transactions, and the digital single market: questions of regulatory fitness, regulatory disconnection and rule redirection (2017) European contract law in the digital age, pp. 165-204. , Grundmann S, (ed), Intersentia, Cambridge; Brownsword, R., Law, liberty and technology (2017) The Oxford handbook of law, regulation and technology, pp. 41-68. , Brownsword R, Scotford E, Yeung K, (eds), Oxford University Press, Oxford; Brownsword, R., From Erewhon to Alpha Go: for the sake of human dignity should we destroy the machines?

Few scholars have studied the influence mechanism behind the adoption of Fintech services. This paper proposes an improved technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates user innovativeness, government support, brand image, and perceived risk as determinants of trust to investigate how users adopt Fintech services. We designed a questionnaire, sent it to active customers of the Hefei Science and Technology Rural Commercial Bank, and obtained 387 eligible responses. We analyzed the data with a structural equation model (SEM) to test the hypotheses, including the relationships of all latent variables. The results reveal that users' trust in Fintech services has a very significant influence on users' attitudes for adoption. In addition, perceived ease of use and perceived risk does not affect users' attitudes toward the adoption regarding Fintech services. This study contributes to the literature of the adoption of Fintech services by providing a more comprehensive view of the determinants of users' attitudes by combining trust of Fintech services with TAM. © 2019 by the authors.","Adoption; Fintech services; Technology acceptance model",,,,,,"16030801121, 17030801001; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 71472001, 71571058, 71690235, 91846107","Funding: This work is fully supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Nos. 91846107, 71571058, 71690235 and 71472001], and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [Nos. 16030801121 and 17030801001]. and Key Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province under Grant No. SK2017A0443.","Acknowledgments: This work is fully supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Nos. 91846107, 71571058, 71690235 and 71472001], and Anhui Provincial Science and Technology Major Project [Nos. 16030801121 and 17030801001], and Key Project of Humanities and Social Sciences in Colleges and Universities of Anhui Province under Grant No. SK2017A0443.",,,,,,,,,"Gabor, D., Brooks, S., The Digital Revolution in Financial Inclusion: International Development in the Fintech Era (2017) New Polit.

This study aims to conduct an in-depth investigation of the banking sector in response to the challenges brought by Fintech startups. Based on the service innovation theory, we propose a novel hybrid multiple criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to evaluate service innovation strategies for improving the sustainability of China's banking industry during the Fintech revolution. A six-dimensional model comprising 20 sub-criteria is constructed and both the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique and DEMATEL-based analytic network process (DANP) are used to explore interrelationships among the indices and their related weights. Finally, the modified VIšekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method is employed to evaluate performance gaps in the four major types of commercial banks in China-state-owned, joint-stock, city commercial banks, and other credit cooperatives-in the field of service innovation. The improvement priorities, ranked from highest to lowest, are new business partners, new service concepts, organizational innovation, technological innovation, new customer interactions, and new revenue models. These results will provide strategies for the sustainable development of China's banking industry and the implementation of changes in response to the impact of the Fintech revolution. © 2019 by the authors.","China's banking industry; DANP; DEMATEL; Fintech; Hybrid MCDM model; Modified VIKOR; Service innovation strategy","banking; business development; competition (economics); decision making; financial market; financial services; innovation; laboratory method; China",,,,,"Ningbo University: 2017A10026, YK180011","This research was sponsored by K.C.

As such ecosystems transform, the basis for being seen as legitimate also changes for all actors. Thus, alliances between actors within financial ecosystems are increasingly formed to help gain, maintain, and repair organizational legitimacy. From interviews with fintech startups in Sweden and with venture capitalist firms investing in fintech startups in Sweden, we explore the intertwined quests for organizational legitimacy in a transforming financial ecosystem. As Swedish fintech startups seek to establish a sense of their legitimacy, simultaneously incumbents seek to maintain and repair their organizational legitimacy. Adopting a legitimacy-based view of strategic alliances, we set out the aspects of organizational legitimacy that incumbents and fintech startups look for in a potential partner and how these aspects meet the legitimacy needs of each partner. We argue that alliances further enhance the organizational legitimacy of both fintech startups and incumbents. © Technology Innovation Management Review 2019.","Financial ecosystems; Fintech startups; Organizational legitimacy; Relational perspective; Strategic alliances",,,,,,"Chalmers Tekniska Högskola","This article draws on a research project carried out from January to May 2018 to conclude Master of Science programs at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.

As one of the most regulated sectors in Turkish economy, financial services are far from being ignored. FinTech companies in Turkey have been developing innovative products and services that provide great value for consumers and businesses. Fast pace of development in areas based on electronic services such as e-invoice, e-payments, e-government services, importance of FinTechs have become more apparent with their agility in taking action and offering innovative services. However, as agile as they might be, FinTech companies tend to ignore the regulations which financial institutions are subject to. ""If it works here, it works everywhere"" approach may have a serious downside when it comes to execution stage. From definition of the service to areas of application, to formation of the company and background of the investors, the ever-dictating financial sector regulations change dramatically from one country to another. As in the example of popular payment provider PayPal, failing to keep primary systems domestically may lead to a rejection of license application from BRSA (Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency) [1] Another example of such regulations is the need to do Due Diligence and monitor suspicious customer activity for AML/CTF purposes for some FinTechs in payment industry. Such requirements can be daunting for a technology-oriented point of view, and many of these companies face these facts at a later stage when they try to coexist or collaborate with other financial institutions. As these requirements may alter operational costs, human resources, and even IT infrastructure, they struggle to find investment or sign contracts with financial institutions. This study covers both successful and unsuccessful FinTech projects in payments and their position against regulations and offer remediations for better acceptance within Turkish financial sector. © 2019 The Authors.

In this research, we are aiming to draw a framework by using business experience in Kuveyt Türk Participation Bank in Turkey to give guidance to other financial institutions in Fintech Integration Process. This study contains entire fintech Integration Process from revealing the needs of the internal departments to the completion of fintech integration. We divided Fintech Integration Process into seven phases. First phase, collecting needs of internal departments. Second phase consist of scouting relevant fintechs around the world by using databases and online platforms. Third phase, fintech makes presentation for introduction and explains its business model. At the end of this meeting, relevant bank employees evaluate the presentation and decide whether to invite fintech again for Business Committee or not. Fourth phase, fintech enters Business Committee to make presentation for Vice Presidents of the relevant departments. Fifth phase, fintech meets with IT, compliance and legal departments to discuss and solve problems. In sixth phase, senior management makes decision to start POC (Proof of Concept) process. Lastly, in seventh phase, fintech integration comes alive for the customer use. All these phases are constructed to mitigate risks and increase awareness of fintechs in the departments. In this way, most of the departments get in touch with fintechs and understand the importance of external collaboration. © 2019 The Authors.

The complex is rapidly evolving, by the end of July 2018 there were about 1700 cryptoprojects globally. The cryptocomplex includes separate cryptosystems linked into a single network via cryptocurrencies trade. The article reveals economic nature and business models of the three largest and most famous cryptosystems – Bitcoin, Ethereum и Ripple, which are responsible for about 70% of the global cryptocomplex capitalization. Though Bitcoin and Ethereum try to create the alternative to the traditional financial system, Ripple proposes new cutting edge technological and effective decisions for the existing banking and payments systems. The authors show that the largest global private cryptosystem Bitcoin, whose goal is substitution of fiat money with bitcoin cryptocurrency, in reality is far away from the ideal system of distributed money, which automatically maintains deals between peers via the neutral computer code. Bitcoin, as well as other systems of cryptocurrencies, has inherent hierarchy and vivid monopoly effects. De-facto control over the Bitcoin functioning rests with the largest players, who replaced the central bank. These players are the main beneficiaries of recurrent rise in capitalization of cryptocurrencies. The strategic task of making bitcoin an alternative to fiat money as a mean of payments has failed. Due to the excessive price volatility bitcoin failed to become a worthy alternative to fiat money and traditional assets as a mean of saving for broad categories of investors. Ethereum and Ripple business models are weakly linked to the dynamics of cryptocurrencies development, serving these systems. Ethereum business model provides for maximization of incomes, rents and other benefits for the system creators from its extensive development. Ripple made an economic bet on selling its special digital solutions to traditional players in financial markets. The authors make a conclusion that cryptocurrencies effectively serve interests of the two clienteles. First are the pioneers of financial sector digitalization, including computer programmers, computer engineers, cryptography and game theory experts as well as venture investors working in parallel. Second are economic agents engaged into various illegal and criminal activities. The authors forecast that given the policies of financial markets regulators the pseudo anonymity of transactions in the sector of cryptocurrencies will cease to exist in the nearest future. © 2019 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.","Bank; Banking; Financial market; Financial services; FinTech accelerators; FinTech company; Innovative financial technologies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Julapa, J., Lemieux, C., Do fintech lenders penetrate areas that are underserved by traditional banks?

Data are obtained from primary sources through internal and external questionnaires, as well as secondary data. The results of the study indicate that, in general, the bank already has a reasonably good innovation readiness, but there are several aspects that need to be noted, namely: Optimization of current services, consolidation, and internal restructuration.

The limited number of the sample was caused by not all of them having published its financial reports, while we have checked 157 FinTech companies. An event study approach using paired sample T-test is utilized. The period used in this study is four years, covering two years before and two years after the company launched FinTech products. Data were obtained from IDX, FinTech.id, and company web-pages. The results clearly showed that there was a significant influence on return on assets (ROA), but no significant difference in return on equity (ROE).

However, lack of funding and limited distribution channels to reach customers are frequent problems faced by farmers to meet the level of sustainability. Agriculture's sustainability can be strengthened by allowing an innovation of services such as Financial Technology (FinTech), and digital marketplace. Digital marketplace with Fintech enabled might transform agriculture's business process into more sustainable in term of funding and distribution. FinTech offers farmers convenient ways of getting sources of funding through crowdfunding and digital payment system. Thus, digital marketplace can act as a platform for FinTech to integrate the innovative financial solution into broader agriculture's ecosystem. The study proposes a modelling digital marketplace with FinTech enabled especially crowdfunding and payment system in order to support agriculture's sustainability. The model connects all actors (farmers, landowners, investors, and consumers) into a platform that can promote transparency, empowerment, resourcefulness, and public engagement in agriculture. © 2019 The Authors.

Improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other FinTech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering. This paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process. With a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation. The idea of adapted stochastic process is essential for the stabilizer, too.

Especially, because of rapidly growing online market and supply of mobile devices, the need for mobile Fintech payment service that enables easy online and off-line payment has increased. According to the 2013 report by market research company Gartner, purchase related global mobile payment market size was predicted to grow from $45.1 billion in 2012 to $224.3 billion in 2017 with average annual growth of 38%. The study will surveyed the recent trends of mobile Fintech payment services and categorized them based on the service forms to suggest requirements and security challenges so that better and securer service can be provided in the future. First, the study defined existing payment services and Fintech payment services by comparing them, and analyzed recent mobile Fintech payment services to classify mobile Fintech payment service providers into Hardware makers, Operating System makers, payment platform providers, and financial institutions to show their common features. Finally it defined requirements that mobile Fintech payment services must meet and security challenges that future and present mobile Fintech payment services will encounter in the perspective of mutual authentication, authorization, integrity, privacy, and availability. Through the suggested study, it is expected that mobile Fintech payment services will develop into more secure services in the future. © 2018, The Author(s).","Finance technology; Fintech; Mobile payment; Security challenges","Authentication; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile telecommunication systems; Average annual growth; Financial institution; Market researches; Mobile payment; Mobile payment market; Mutual authentication; Offline payments; Security challenges; Fintech",,,,,,"This work was financially supported by Baewha Women’s University.",,,,,,,,,,"Lee, A.R., Ahn, H.Y., Fintech users’ information privacy concerns and user resistance: investigating the interaction effect with regulatory focus (2016) J Korea Inst Inf Secur Cryptol, 26 (1), pp. 209-226; Park, S.W., Lee, I.Y., Anonymous authentication scheme based on NTRU for the protection of payment information in NFC mobile environment (2013) J Inf Process Syst, 9, pp. 461-476; Thakur, R., Srivastava, M., Adoption readiness, personal innovativeness, perceived risk and usage intention across customer groups for mobile payment services in India (2014) Internet Res, 24 (3), pp. 369-392; Dahlberg, T., Guo, J., Ondrus, J., A critical review of mobile payment research (2015) Electron Commer Res Appl, 14 (5), pp. 265-284; José Liébana-Cabanillas, F., Sánchez-Fernández, J., Muñoz-Leiva, F., Role of gender on acceptance of mobile payment (2014) Ind Manag Data Syst, 114 (2), pp. 220-240; Perez, A.J., Zeadally, S., Jabeur, N., Security and privacy in ubiquitous sensor networks (2018) J Inf Process Syst, 14, pp. 286-308; Yang, S., Mobile payment services adoption across time: an empirical study of the effects of behavioral beliefs, social influences, and personal traits (2012) Comput Hum Behav, 28 (1), pp. 129-142; Capgemini, R., (2016) World Payments Report 2016, , Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Financial Industry Issues; Gulamhuseinwala, I., Bull, T., Lewis, S., FinTech is gaining traction and young, high-income users are the early adopters (2015) J Financ Perspect, 3 (3), pp. 16-23; Han, Y.H., Lim, H.K., Gil, J.M., Hierarchical location caching scheme for mobile object tracking in the internet of things (2017) J Inf Process Syst, 13, pp. 1410-1429; Steeves, D., The Social Impact of FinTech in Nigeria (2016) The FinTech Book, pp. 78-80. , John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Chichester, UK; Zavolokina, L., Dolata, M., Schwabe, G., The FinTech phenomenon: antecedents of financial innovation perceived by the popular press (2016) Hum Centric Comput Inf Sci, 2, p. 16; Li, Y., Spigt, R., Swinkels, L., The impact of FinTech start-ups on incumbent retail banks’ share prices (2017) Hum Centric Comput Inf Sci, 3, p. 26; Lee, S.H., Lee, D.W., (2016) Review on Fintech Industry in Oversea; Skan, J., (2014) The Boom in Global Fintech Investment; Park, Y.J., Jang, S.M., Understanding privacy knowledge and skill in mobile communication (2014) Comput Hum Behav, 38, pp. 296-303; Liang, X., Security and privacy in mobile social networks: challenges and solutions (2014) IEEE Wirel Commun, 21 (1), pp. 33-41; Smalley, S., Craig, R., Security enhanced (SE) android: Bringing flexible MAC to android (2013) Proceedings of the NDSS, 2013, , https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2013/ndss-2013-programme/security-enhanced-se-android-bringing-flexible-mac-android/, In; Li, Q., Clark, G., Mobile security: a look ahead (2013) IEEE Secur Priv, 11 (1), pp. 78-81; Kadhiwal, S., Zulfiquar, A.U.S., Analysis of mobile payment security measures and different standards (2007) Comput Fraud Secur, 2007 (6), pp. 12-16; Linck, K., Pousttchi, K., Wiedemann, D.G., (2006) Security Issues in Mobile Payment from the Customer Viewpoint, pp. 1-11; Zhou, T., An empirical examination of continuance intention of mobile payment services (2013) Decis Support Syst, 54 (2), pp. 1085-1091; Cheong, C.P., Fong, S., Lei, P., Chatwin, C.R., Young, R.C., Designing an efficient and secure credit cardbased payment system with web services based on the ANSI X9.59-2006 (2012) J Inf Process Syst, 8, pp. 495-520; Ondrus, J., Pigneur, Y., An assessment of NFC for future mobile payment systems (2007) International Conference on The.

Analysing these records shows that (i) current research on FinTech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all. © 2018 The Authors.

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation",,,,,,,"Finally, only a few companies around the world are able to quickly export their fintech/regtech products and services to other countries. These are usually the ‘first movers’ and they are strongly financed by established financial markets and supported by advanced technology-platforms for scaling. For smaller markets, the small and medium-sized companies potentially face the future scaling and funding problem. Such companies may already be partially successful in their respective markets but further expansion financing for growth and internationalisation can come across the ‘bottleneck’ consequence. Much of the decline in the number of ‘smaller’ companies becoming listed is attributed to the very difficulty of being a small public company; this is reflected in the actions of venture capitalists, who once sought public listings when they wanted to exit their investments and now overwhelmingly choose private sales (Ritter, Economist, 2018 ). There is thus the real potential that firms are going to seek strategic alliances with incumbent financial institutions within the sector as their survival strategy. The risk for promising fintech/start-up companies is that there is also the potential to be constricted under the pressure of having to meet invariable demands in the services and products they offer. As such the issue becomes one of scale and capacity against larger firms, possibly the incumbents or indeed technology giants (i.e. Amazon, Apple etc.). This is important as at this stage. This is an industry with no ‘made’, crisis-resistant, proven businesses thus far. We do not know yet whether start-ups are mentally prepared for ‘exchanges’ in order to finance growth. In an industry under exponential development, pure cash exits do not exist as well for venture capital nor do acquisition evaluation models of a ‘made’ fintech business exist. Established institutions have the scale to absorb this which potentially gives rise to growth through a mergers and acquisitions wave. A pragmatic way for mergers to go through at this point is via exchanges of shares. The dangers in such a scenario are the ‘old-new firms’ where they ‘grow-and-consume’ entrants.",,,,,,,,,,"Accenture, Global fintech investment growth continues in 2016 driven by Europe and Asia, accenture study finds (2016), https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-fintech-investment-growth-continues-in-2016-driven-by-europe-and-asia-accenture-study-finds.htm, April 13 News Release; Agarwal, S., Lucca, D., Seru, A., Trebbi, F., Inconsistent regulators: Evidence from banking (2014) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129 (2), pp. 889-938; Aggarwal, R., Stein, P., The complex regulatory landscape for FinTech: An Uncertain future for small and medium-sized enterprise lending (2016), World Economic Forum White Paper No. 170816; Allan, G., Hagiwara, Y., Japan regulation shakeup is seen as a game changer for banks (2018), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/japan-finance-regulation-shakeup-seen-as-game-changer-for-banks, February 26, Accessed 10/03/2018 Bloomberg; Allen, F., Gale, D., Financial intermediaries and markets (2004) Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 72 (4), pp. 1023-1061; Allen, F., Gale, D., Understanding financial crises, clarendon lectures in finance (2007), Oxford University Press; Allen, F., Gale, D., Bubbles and crises (2000) The Economic Journal, 110 (460), pp. 236-255; Allen, F., Gale, D., Financial contagion (2000) The Journal of Political Economy, 108 (1), pp. 1-33; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the Re- conceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37 (3), pp. 371-413; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of FinTech: A new post-crisis paradigm?

We find that LendingClub's consumer lending activities have penetrated areas that may be underserved by traditional banks, such as in highly concentrated markets and areas that have fewer bank branches per capita. We also find that the portion of LendingClub loans increases in areas where the local economy is not performing well. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Banking competition; Fintech; LendingClub; Marketplace lending; Peer-to-peer lending; Shadow banking",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahmed, U., Beck, T., McDaniel, C., Schropp, S., Filling the gap: How technology enables access to finance for small- and medium-Sized enterprises (2016) MIT Press Journals: Innovations, 10 (3-4), pp. 35-48; Athwal, N., Online marketplace lending – Recently misunderstood?

Fintech startups, high-tech firms but also mobile network operators are indeed challenging the status quo with their innovative propositions, trying to disintermediate banks from their traditional function of payment service providers. In the payments market, mobile wallets represent one of the innovations with highest potential of growth in the consumer-to-business segment. Payment market is a large and profitable segment for retail banking. Besides revenue streams from card payment transactions, new sources of revenueas and value creation have been unleashed by digital payments. This paper contributes to provide a better understanding of the mobile wallet ecosystem, also analyzing a set of four business cases so to identify potential sources of competitive advantage for retail banks in a market characterized by an increased non-bank competition. Mobile wallet platforms can be a powerful tool for banks to cope with the customer-centric approach. The structure of the paper analyse the recent trends in the financial services industry, involving the entry of new players (Fintech); the evolution of payments in the market; the concept of ecosystem applied to the new payment landscape; and it outlines the banks' roles in the new mobile payment environment. © 2018, International Journal of Financial Research.","Ecosystem; Fintech; Mobile wallet; Payments; Platform; Platform; Retail bank",,,,,,,"-Years 70‟s.

In this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by RD activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms. © 2018 IEEE.","China; family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); state-owned enterprises (SOEs)","Engineering; Industrial engineering; China; Family firms; fintech; Small and medium-sized enterprise; State owned enterprise; Finance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dorfleitner, G., Hornuf, L., Schmitt, M., Weber, M., FinTech in Germany (2017) Springer International Publishing, , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-54666-7; Zhu, X., Understanding China's growth: Past, present and future (2012) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26 (4), pp. 103-124; Boycko, M., Shleifer, A., Vishny, R.W., A theory of privatization (1996) Economic Journal, 106 (435), pp. 309-319; Megginson, W., Netter, J., From state to market: A survey of empirical studies on privatization (2001) Journal of Economics Literature, 39 (2), pp. 321-389; Kornai, J., Resource-constrained versus demand-constrained systems (1979) Econometrica, 47 (4), pp. 801-819; Kornai, J., (1980) Economics of Shortage, , Amsterdam: North-Holland; Allen, F., Qian, J., Qian, M., Law, finance, and economic growth in China (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 77 (1), pp. 57-116; Jensen, M.C., Meckling, W.H., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure (1976) Journal of Financial Economics, 3 (4), pp. 305-360; Megginson, W., Ullah, B., Wei, Z., State ownership, soft-budget constraints, and cash holdings: Evidence from China's privatized firms (2014) Journal of Banking & Finance, 48, pp. 276-291; Beck, T., Demirguc-Kunt, A., Maksimovic, V., Financing patterns around the world: Are small firms different?

The second phenomenon is digital technology has been able to change the behavior of Indonesian people in all aspects of life, such as electronic books, electronic newspapers, online sales and public transportation (taxis and motorcycles). The third phenomenon is FinTechs services in Indonesia include Payment channel system, Digital Banking, Online/Digital Insurance, Peer-to-peer (P2P) Lending and Crow funding. Banks should be able to balance the development of this digital technology by providing new products that are close to customer's wishes. There is a gap that has not been served by banks in Indonesia that resulted in the emergence of potential benefits that can be taken by Start-up Company (pioneer) FinTech in providing services and banking products. Banking in Indonesia can synergize with start-up companies (pioneer) FinTech by changing its business process by doing Business Process Reengineering (BPR). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Finance; Peer to peer networks; Reengineering; Business process re-engineering; Digital technologies; Disruptive technology; Financial service; Potential benefits; Public transportation; research methods; Start-up companies; Electronic publishing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Siregar, A.E., (2016) Financial Technology Trend Bisnis Keuangan Ke Depan, , (infobanknews.com); Hadad, M., (2017) Financial Technology (FinTech) di Indonesia Kuliah Umum Tentang Fintech-IBS; Ramanigopal, C.S., Palaniappan, G., Hemalatha, N., Murugan, T., Business Process Reengineering and Its Applications (2011) International Journal of Management Research and Review, 1, pp. 275-288; Ringim, K.J., Osman, N.H., Hasnan, N., Razalli, M.R., Exploring the Implementation of Business Process Reengineering in Banks (2013) Asian Social Science, 9; Osano, M.H., Okwena, D., Factors Influencing Performance of Business of Business Process Reengineering Projects in Bank in Kenya : Case of Kenya Comemercial Bank (2015) Journal of US-China Public AdMinistration, 12, pp. 26-34; Moad, J., Does reengineering really work (1993) Datamation, , August 1; Barrett, J.L., Process visualization: Getting the vision right is the key (1994) Information Systems Management, 11 (2), pp. 14-23; Guha, S., Kettinger, W., Teng, T., Business process reengineering: Building a comprehensive methodology (1993) Information Systems Management, Summer, 12, pp. 3-22; Jackson, N., Business process re-engineering (1997) Management Services, 12, pp. 34-36; Al-Mashari, M., Zairi, M., BPR implementation process: An analysis of key success and failure factors (1999) Business Process Management Journal, 5 (1), pp. 87-112; Ika, A., (2017) Bisnis Model Baru Bank-Fintech Dan Ekonomi Digital, , www.kompas.com; (2017) Redwaring the Lines: Fintech's Growing Influence on Financial Services PWC, , Global FinTech Report",,"Abdullah A.G.Nandiyanto A.B.D.Warlina L.Kurniati P.S.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing","International Conference on Informatics, Engineering, Science and Technology, INCITEST 2018","9 May 2018 through 10 May 2018",,140092,17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially. It could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces. Yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the European Union (EU). Even the largest fintech market, in China, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation. In the EU, much of fintech is concentrated in the UK. We argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently. (i) Develop a European or national fintech market? (ii) What regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) Should supervision of fintech be exercised at the European level? (iv) What is the overall vision for the EU's financial system? Getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system. In contrast, late action could mean that Europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in Europe. © The Author(s) 2018.

The Generation Z, also called Gen Tech, who was growing up using the internet and especially the mobile internet on a daily basis, will probably be the larger adopter and beneficiary of these innovative financial technologies. The current generation of students, born about twenty years ago, is part of this cohort and this is why we decided to initiate a study regarding their perception and behavior concerning the fintech area with the help of a questionnaire applied on some of the students of the Faculty of European Studies from Babeş-Bolyai University. Because the fintech is covering financial innovations from a very broad area (including cryptocurrency, online payments, financial transfers, openbanking, investments, regtech, insurtech, etc.) we decided to focus in this preliminary study, only on the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies and in relation to these, on the online payments. © 2018 Faculty of European Studies.","Bitcoin; Blockchain; Cryptocurrencies; Cyber security; Fintech; Online payments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Antonopoulos, A.M., (2017) Mastering Bitcoin, , USA, O'Reilly Media Inc; Badea, L., Virtual Currency-A Viable Alternative To The Classical Currency (2017) Proceedings of the International Conference: Information Society and Sustainable Development, , IVth Edition, April 28-29; Bucovetschi, O., Badea, D., Stanciu, R., (2018) Blockchain technology-a new approach in business environment, , Annual Session of Scientific Papers IMT ORADEA 2018; Cheng, E., (2018) There are now 17 million bitcoins in existence-only 4 million left to 'mine', , https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/26/there-are-now-17-million-bitcoins-in-existence-only-4-million-left-to-mine.html, CNBC, April 26, 2018 (accessed August 30, 2018); Chishti, S., Barberis, J., (2016) The FINTECH Book: The Financial Technology Handbook for Investors, Entrepreneurs and Visionaries, , John Wiley & Sons; Dimbean-Creta, O., Fintech-already new fashion in finance, but what about the future?

Leveraging digital technologies to offer innovative services, FinTech start-ups are emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance. Despite increasing investments, the FinTech phenomenon is low on theoretical insights. So far, the offerings of FinTech start-ups have been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective. As a functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the offerings of FinTech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional characteristics. Thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented FinTech start-ups. Our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along the perspectives interaction, data, and monetization. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227 FinTech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a cluster analysis. Our taxonomy contributes to the descriptive knowledge on FinTech start-ups, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze the service offerings of FinTech start-up in a structured manner. © 2017, The Author(s).","Business model; Financial services; Financial technology; FinTech; Services; Taxonomy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Agresti, A., (2007) An introduction to categorical data analysis, , 2, Wiley, New York; (2015) Fintech, , http://www.allenovery.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/Fintech.PDF, Retrieved 1 October 2016.

Recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies. There is a requirement for FinTech or IoT to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself. While some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities. Thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society. Products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses; this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation. This paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples. © 2018","Business model; FinTech; Innovation; IoT; Mobility","Carrier mobility; Business modeling; Business models; Business sector; Company development; FinTech; New business models; New services; Products and services; Internet of things",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nakashima, T., Lets Build the True Eco-Car (2010), Tokyo Nikkei BP; Mandaluyong City.

Entrepreneurial endeavours to this end are diverse. Indeed, the propensity toward complexity is considerable, bridging a range of financial services, markets, innovations, industry participants, infrastructures, and technologies. This study aims to improve comprehension of the global fintech landscape. It is based on the analysis of start-ups that participated in SWIFT's Innotribe competition. We used cluster analysis to group 402 fintech start-up firms, and then selected representative cases to create a foundational understanding of the structure of the fintech landscape. The main findings of this work are: (1) the development of fintech clusters to classify core services, business infrastructures, and underlying component technologies, which characterize fintech; (2) an analysis of how fintechs synthesize different technologies to restructure flows of financial information through competitive and cooperative mechanisms of disinter-mediation, extension of access, financialization, hybridization, and personalization; (3) an analysis of related strategies for value creation connected with the competitive and cooperative mechanisms that were identified. Collectively, our results offer new insights into the diversity and range of emergent innovations and technologies that Q2 are transforming the financial services industry worldwide.

The industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer experience, and approaches that result in services transformation. Industry and academic observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes, with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer centricity, and informedness. The long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the “Fintech Revolution” is at stake. We present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services. We discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology innovations that have begun to leverage the execution and stakeholder value associated with payments, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and cross-border payments; multiple innovations that have affected lending and deposit services, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and social media use; issues with respect to investments, financial markets, trading, risk management, robo-advisory and services influenced by blockchain and fintech innovations.

In order to realize a cashless society, each country adopts mobile payment method as its main policy objective. It is actively promoting regulations and alleviating regulations. This is a very important task. Since the mobile easy payment services are still in the infancy phase, it is being investigated that the acceptance rate among the layers is various. Through previous researches, it was confirmed that the most important factor affecting the intention of using mobile easy payment service was perceived usefulness, and the factors influencing perceived usefulness were classified as personal characteristics, service characteristics, environmental characteristics and service characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether people with experience using mobile easy payment service will continue to use the service in the future and what factors influence the intention to use the service continuously. The results of the study showed that the variables of personal characteristics and service characteristics influenced the intention to use continuously in the future through perceived usefulness. In addition, it has been found that the various gaps between the layers are important factors in the future intention of mobile payment service. According to the results of this study, the important national task in spreading mobile payment service is suggesting that how to resolve the smart divide and the income gap is an important policy task. © 2018 SERSC Australia.","FinTech; Income divide; Mobile easy payment service; Smart divide; TAM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Davis, F.D., (1989) 'Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology', , MIS Quarterly; Rogers, E.M., (2003) 'Diffusion of Innovations', , 5th edition, Free Press; Bandura, A., 'Self-efficacy; Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change' (1977) Psychological Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Thompson, R.L., Higgins, C.A., Howell, J.M., 'Personal Computing: Toward a conceptual Model of Utilization' (1991) MIS Quarterly, 15 (1), pp. 125-143; Pham, T.T.T., Ho, J.C., 'The Effects of Product-Related, Personal-Related Factors and Attractiveness of Alternatives on Consumer Adoption of NFC-based Mobile Payments' (2015) Technology in Society, 43, pp. 1-16; Fornell, C., Larcker, D.F., 'Evaluating Structural Equation Models with Unobservable Variables and Measurement Error' (1981) Journal of Marketing Research, 18 (1), pp. 39-50; Hair, J.F., Jr., Black, W.C., Babin, B.J., Anderson, R.E., (2010) 'Multivariate Data Analysis', , 7th edition, pearson Hall; Davis, F.D., 'User acceptance of Information technology: system characteristics, user perception and behavioral impacts' (1993) International journal of man-machine studies, 38 (3), pp. 475-487; Chandrika, G., 'Study on Software Reliability and Reliability Testing' (2015) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (1), pp. 7-20. , March; Peddigari, R., 'Impact of User Ratings on Mobile Apps Due Fault and Change Proneness in API' (2015) Asiapacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (2), pp. 43-59. , June; Hyun Kim, J., Sekhar Reddy, R., 'Implementation of Mobile Apps Across Globe and Challenge to Software Engineering' (2015) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (3), pp. 1-16. , September; Hee Lee, J., Raj, K., 'Hybrid Data Management in Cloud Security' (2015) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 1 (4), pp. 33-39. , December; Udayini, A., 'An Approach for Routing Queries in P2P Networks' (2016) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 2 (1), pp. 7-12; Krishna, L., 'Authenticated Searching Multi Key word in the Cloud Computing' (2016) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 2 (1), pp. 29-36. , March; Sai Raaga Sowmya, T., 'Cost Minimization for Big Data Processing in Geo-Distributed Data Centres' (2016) Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange, HSST, 2 (4), pp. 33-41. , December; Bansal, M., Shricastava, L., 'Performance Analysis of Wireless Mobile Adhoc Network with Different Types of Antennas' (2017) HSST, 3 (1), pp. 33-44. , March; lgbaria, M., Livari, J., 'The effects of self-efficacy on computer usage' (1995) Omega, 23 (6), pp. 587-605","Han, K.S.; School of Business Administration, South Korea; email: kshan@ssu.ac.kr",,,"Science and Engineering Research Support Society",,,,,20054238,,,,"English","Int.

The results of the study show that fintech is more than just a phenomenon, it cannot be compared to other start-ups, and has the potential to fundamentally change the business and economic landscape. © Nofie Iman, 2018","Adoption; Financial services; Financial technology; Innovation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bryman, A., Bell, E., (2007) Business Research Methods, , New York: Oxford University Press; Cassell, C., Symon, G., (2004) Essential Guide to Qualitative Methods in Organizational Research, , London: SAGE Publications; Christensen, C., (1997) The Innovator’S Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; Coase, R., The nature of the firm (1937) Economica, 4 (16), pp. 386-405. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x; Creswell, J.W., (2003) Qualitative, Quantitative and Mixed Methods Approaches, , London: SAGE Publications Ltd; Denzin, N.K., Lincoln, Y.S., (1994) Handbook of Qualitative Research, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage; (2017) Mobile Phones in Indonesia, , www.euromonitor.com/mobile-phones-in-indonesia/report, Retrieved from accessed on August 5, 2018; (2017) A Definition by FinTech Weekly, , https://www.fintechweekly.com/fintech-definition, Retrieved from accessed on March 29, 2017; Gawer, A., Cusumano, M., (2002) Platform Leadership: How Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco Drive Industry Innovation, , Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press; (2014) The Global Findex Database: Indonesia, , http://datatopics.worldbank.org/financialinclusion/country/indonesia, Retrieved from accessed on August 5, 2018; Hung, J.L., Luo, B., Fintech in Taiwan: A case study of a Bank’s strategic planning for an investment in a FinTech company (2016) Financial Innovation, 2 (1), pp. 1-15. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s40854-016-0037-6; Jensen, M.C., Meckling, W.H., Theory of the firm: Managerial behavior, agency costs and ownership structure (1976) Journal of Financial Economics, 3 (4), pp. 305-360. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(76)90026-X; Katz, M., Shapiro, S., Network externalities, competition and compatibility (1985) American Economic Review, 75, pp. 424-440. , http://idv.sinica.edu.tw/kongpin/teaching/io/KatzShapiro1.pdf, Retrieved from; Liebowitz, S.J., Margolis, S.E., Network externality: An uncommon tragedy (1994) The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 8, pp. 133-150. , https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.8.2.133; Riemer, K., Hafermalz, E., Roosen, A., Boussand, N., El Aoufi, H., Mo, D., Kosheliev, A., (2017) The Fintech Advantage: Harnessing Digital Technology, Keeping The Customer in Focus, , https://www.capgemini.com/au-en/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/08/the_fintech_ad-vantage.pdf, University of Sydney, Business School and Capgemini; Rochet, J.-C., Tirole, J., Platform competition in two-sided markets (2003) Journal of The European Economic Association, 1 (4), pp. 990-1029. , https://doi.org/10.1162/154247603322493212; (2017) Definition of Fintech in English by Oxford Dictionaries, , https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fintech, Retrieved from accessed on March 29, 2017; (2017) Digital in Southeast Asia in 2017, , https://wearesocial.com/special-reports/digital-southeast-asia-2017, Retrieved from accessed on March 4, 2018; Williamson, O.E., Transaction cost economics: The governance of contractual relations (1979) Journal of Law and Economics, 22 (2), pp. 233-261. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/466942; Williamson, O.E., The economics of organization: The transaction cost approach (1981) American Journal of Sociology, 87 (3), pp. 548-577. , https://doi.org/10.1086/227496; Zavolokina, L., Dolata, M., Schwabe, G., FinTech – What’s in a name?

New financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets. Changing the traditional financial services concept, FinTech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system. The purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the FinTech market on the example of Ukraine. In order to study the development of the FinTech industry, a multiple regression model was presented. The model describes the dependence of the total investment value of FinTech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending. Based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new FinTech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified. According to the model, with a change in investments in FinTech by 1%, the total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89. According to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the FinTech services sphere, it was found that the regulation of most of the risks associated with the development of FinTech services falls within the competence of different supervisory authorities, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation between public institutions. © Limited Liability Company","Digital finance; Financial services market; Financial supervision; Financial technologies; FinTech; InsurTech; Investment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2018) Real Estate Market in Armenia, , http://www.avenueconsulting.am/reports/download/42/Real_Estate_Mar-ket_in_Armenia:_Outlook_2018.html, Retrieved from; Global Charts, , https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/, n.d; (2017) Vision 2020 for FinTech and Non-Bank Regulation, , https://www.csbs.org/vision2020, Retrieved from; Perkins, D.W., (2018) Marketplace Lending: FinTech in Consumer and Small-Business Lending, , https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44614.pdf, Retrieved from; (2018) InsurThech Entering Its Second Wave, , https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Docu-ments/financial-services/us-dcfs-insurtech-entering-second-wave.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Armenian ICT Sector Enterprise Incubator Foundation, , http://www.eif.am/eng/researches/report-on-the-state-of-the-industry/, n.d; (2018) The Future of FinTech and Financial Services, , https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-the-future-of-FinTech-and-financial-services-whats-the-next-big-bet/$FILE/EY-the-future-of-FinTech-and-financial-services-whats-the-next-big-bet.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Global Insurance M&A Themes, , https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-gloal-insurance-themes-2017/$FILE/ey-gloal-insurance-themes-2017.pdf, Young n.d; https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/fca-innovate, ); (2015) Supervisory Insight, , https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/siwin15/si_winter2015.pdf, Retrieved from; (2016) Prepaid Accounts Under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E) and the Truth In Lending Act (Regulation Z), , https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/11/22/2016-24503/prepaid-accounts-under-the-electronic-fund-transfer-act-regulation-e-and-the-truth-in-lending-act, Retrieved from; (2016) FinTech Ecosystem in Ukraine, , Future magazine; (2017) FinTech Has Not a Trend Yet, , Future magazine; Godin, S., (2016) Permissive Marketing: How to Make a Friend of A Stranger, and Turn It into A Buyer, , https://www.amazon.com/Permission-Marketing-Turning-Strangers-Customers/dp/0684856360, Retrieved from; Hileman, G., Rauchs, M., (2017) Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study, , https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2017-global-cryptocurrency-benchmarking-study.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) Regulatory Innovation Plan, , https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attach-ment_data/file/606953/HM_Trea-sury_Regulatory_Innovation_Plan.pdf, Retrieved from; (2017) FinTech and Financial Services: Initial Considerations, , https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2017/sdn1705.ashx.28, Retrieved from; Horsley, J.P., (2017) Guiding Opinions on Promoting Development of the Sharing Economy, , http://www.chinalawtranslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017-7-28-Sharing-Economy-Opin-ions-JPH-Tr.pdf, Retrieved from; Gogo, J., (2018) $50 Million Bitcoin Mining Farm Opens in Armenia, , https://news.bitcoin.com/50-million-bitcoin-mining-farm-opens-in-armenia/, Retrieved from; Day, J., (2017) The OCC's Responsible Innovation Framework and FinTech Bank Charters - Latest Developments, , http://www.jonesday.com/files/Publication/0ca79769-65e5-40f8-b7e5-12354198ba73/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/7ab2c44a-3ac5-403f-b1aa-2ac654ad79cb/OCC%20Responsible%20Inno-vation%20Framework.pdf, Retrieved from; Kim, W.C., Moborn, R., (2016) Blue Ocean Strategy.

The paper identifies disruptive challenges for financial institutions need to adapt. The research investigates the value and the investment flows structure as most obvious indicators of FinTech and describes types of payments relationships there. The paper considers relationships between enterprises, financial institutions and individuals, which are formed in digital payments. To understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and P2P crossborder money transfers with TransferWise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined. For Ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with FinTech is a crucial challenge. That is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices. A great example of cross-border payments of FinTech in Ukraine is TransferWise. The difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period. By transforming existing cost structures and mitigating market imperfections, they provide innovative services that meet the users' needs for speed, trust, low cost, usability, security and transparency. The results show high potential of FinTech for cross-border payment processing. © Yuriy Petrushenko.","Digital economy; Financial innovations; Financial services; Financial sphere; Financial technologies; Payment methods; Start-up; Venture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Top 10 Trends in Financial Services, , https://aitegroup.com/sites/default/files/storage_0/20170105_Top%2010%20Trends%20in%20Financial%20Services%202017.pdf, Retrieved December 28, 2017 from; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2015) The Evolution of Fintech: A New PostCrisis Paradigm?; Barr, M., Klifford, K., Klein, A., (2018), https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/es_20180413_fintech_access.pdf, The Brookings Institution.

Following genetics, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves, the proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neuronS. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex Deep Learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast local current decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the information learned to future generationS. The presented algorithm and Deep Learning structure has been applied and validated in a Fintech Model; a Smart Investment application where an Intelligent Bankers are specialised in Buy and sell decisions on several Assets, Markets and RiskS. The obtained results are promising; the proposed model combines human brain and genetics with Deep Learning structure based on the Random Neural Network model where biology; similar as Artificial Intelligence is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment. © 2018 The Author(s).","Deep Learning Clusters;

So-called ‘Fintech disruptors’ are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition. As banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies. Aim: To identify the strategic implications of Fintech on South African retail banks. Setting: The study is conducted in the South African retail banking industry. Methods: A post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature. Results: There are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike; secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy; thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past; fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions; finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable. Conclusion: By adapting to the Fintech revolution, South African retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive. This will allow them not only to identify opportunities first, but also to offer solutions before competitors are able to do either of these. © 2018.

Basing on its existing ""balanced"" approach in promoting financial development and ensuring a safe and sound financial sector, and in sync with its objective to harness technology to improve the efficiency of the financial markets, the paper elaborates on the insights of MAS' policy intent in regulating the FinTech sector. The paper then focuses on MAS' proposed ""Regulatory Sandbox"" - an innovative regulatory framework which helps to strike a good balance between creating a conducive environment for financial innovation and on the other hand protecting financial consumers and ensuring financial stability. In closing, the paper shares some thought of the writer on MAS' approach and the likely future development of MAS' financial regulation towards financial technology. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The authors defined the main features of FinTech platforms underlining types of FinTech, its participants and the most influential factors. The main trends of FinTech platforms development in the EU countries, such as the level of investment, impact of EU FinTech platforms on the global scale, features of investments into B2B FinTech, were determined. It was considered that in Ukraine, some positive changes in legislation were adopted, but the challenges like lack of finance, slow adoption of innovations in the financial market, not sufficient clarity of legislation remain among the main constraints for further development of FinTech platforms in Ukraine. The conducted analysis on the level of FinTech types performance by Ukrainian platforms showed only the great share of digital payments and money transfers, while other modern innovative FinTech instruments should not be underestimated for proper FinTech application in Ukraine. For this purpose, the authors have developed the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations that consolidates interests of both SMEs and scientists. To determine both the SMEs’ opinion about the necessity of a particular Internet platform for them and the types of services that could be provided by the sme-sci.com platform, the authors conducted a survey in which 374 medium-sized and 380 small businesses took part. The results of the survey that are presented in the article confirm the necessity of the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations and demand for it from the SMEs. Finally, the result of the research proves that such a unique informational platform as sme-sci. com that will serve as an interactive field for exchanging ideas and information of both representatives of scientific and business world is of great importance. © Alla Ivashchenko, Igor Britchenko, Mykhailo Dyba, Yevheniia Polishchuk, Yuliia Sybirianska, Yurii Vasylyshen, 2018","Crowdfunding; Equity funding; FinTech platforms; Information platforms; New technologies; P2P lending",,,,,,"Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, MESU","As a result of implementation of the young scholars’ research project “The new paradigm of financial support of innovations in small and medium enterprises” (it is funded by the Ministry of Science of Ukraine), the Information Platform on Support for SME Innovation (sme-sci.com) was developed.

The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast local current decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the information learned to future generations. This proposed structure has been applied and validated in Fintech; a Smart Investment application: an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Assets with an associated market and risk.

This consequently puts the financial services industry under additional pressure and constant growing competition from the financial sector participants, from large technology companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, from large FinTech companies such as PayPal, Moven, TransferWise, mobile network operators and other existing and potential market players. The implementation of the new EU Payment Service Directive (PSD2), which allows non-financial companies to provide access to financial services for bank customers, is expected to disrupt the financial services industry as we know it, and make traditional financial services providers and banks, in particular, think of new creative business models to remain competitive. In the process of doing this, changing the landscape of payments and creating new risks for banking business. With this study we aim to assess the new EU Payment Service regulation in the context of industry competitiveness. The study is based on the examination of the PSD2 Directive exploring the opportunities as well as the risks that it will bring to this industry in the near future, and the possibilities of cooperation of the financial services industry with financial technology developers. Moreover, we analyse structured data, collected from a questionnaire based on 4 themes of perception of techs on the importance they have on ensuring competitiveness, conducted with European tech companies. Most of the questionnaire participants believe that the Payment Services Directive 2 will promote competitiveness, innovations and development. Moreover, findings show that comparativeness is related mainly to low costs and customer satisfaction. However, it is also shown that high quality of products/services as well as relatively high speed of transactions and security, privacy and risk are also perceived as important. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

Across Europe there is no common practice of using the credit data of consumers, which can be exploited for several purposes. Traditionally, they are used by the lending industry as a risk-management tool to underwrite borrowing decisions or price risks, but they can also be used as a practice of creditworthiness assessment. In some Member States, consumer data are part of a broader information centralisation system for the prudential supervision of banks and the financial system as a whole. Within this already complex picture, emerging technologies and the processing of new generations of personal data are starting to give way to new business models that can transform retail financial markets (Fintechs). Whatever the function the data perform, their source, type, breath, and depth differ greatly from country to country. Unlike for the harmonisation of EU rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonised legal framework. Likewise, the establishment of the Banking Union and the prudential supervision of the Euro-area demand standardisation and convergence of the data used to measure debt levels, arrears, and delinquencies. The many functions and different usages of credit data suggest that the policy goals to be achieved should inform the design and structure of the databases, as well as the role, legal, and institutional framework of the organisations managing the data system (the Data Brokers). This is also because fundamental rights and consumer protection concerns arise from the dissemination and sharing of traditional and non-traditional data, as well as from their expanding uses. This is an area of the EU internal market that demands the attention of the EU legislator without further delays. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Consumer law and policy; Credit data & big data; EU market integration; Fundamental rights; Retail financial markets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Facilitating Access to Finance - Discussion Paper on Credit Information Sharing, , https://www1.oecd.org/globalrelations/45370071.pdf; Should the availability of UK credit data be improved?

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. Methods: To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Results: Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Conclusions: Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious. © 2017, The Author(s).","Banks; Digital banking; Finance; FinTech; Innovation; Retail banks;

Authoritative settlement based on central bank support is seen as being essential for both large value and retail payment systems; and, in the EU, UK, and US, the importance of regulating for the protection of consumers who use retail payment systems is recognised. In this institutional context, payment innovations (including Bitcoin and distributed ledger or autonomous organisation technologies) are assessed. It is suggested that, while competition at certain levels is likely to bring social benefits through commercial developments, the maintenance of public interest objectives necessarily delineates the scope of competition. While this might limit the disruptive impact of payment innovations, it is argued that, in the light of the public policy needs for a stable and efficient public infrastructure and the social needs of confidence and trust in a predictable and regulated payment system that meets commercial and social expectations such as in consumer protection, this is not necessarily undesirable. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","clearing and settlement; distributed ledger technology; payment innovation; Payment Services Directive; Payment systems; virtual currency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Chiu, I.H.-Y.; Professor of Corporate Law and Financial Regulation, United Kingdom; email: hse-yu.chiu@ucl.ac.uk",,,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,,,,17579961,,,,"English","Law Innov.

It impacts financial institutions, regulators, customers, and merchants across a wide range of industries. Pervasive digital technologies are challenging the fundamentals of the highly regulated financial sector, leading to the emergence of non-traditional payment systems, peer-to-peer money exchanges and increased turbulence in currency markets. This case study explores the development of a FinTech company in China that offers microloans to college students. Five lessons learned are presented for organizations to better manage the challenges and to leverage the opportunities amidst the disruption of financial sector. Our findings also shed light on how digital technology 1) offers the strategic capability for a firm to occupy a market niche in financial sector, 2) enables the generation of alternative credit scores based on non-traditional data, and 3) improves the financial inclusion of previously excluded market segments. © 2016 The Authors","Case study; Ecosystem development; Financial inclusion; FinTech; Online microloan","Commerce; Ecosystems; Peer to peer networks; Product design; Students; Digital technologies; Ecosystem development; Financial inclusions; Financial institution; Financial products; FinTech; Online microloan; Strategic capability; Finance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"BBVA Research, Improving credit access for the invisibles (2015), Digital Economy Outlook Spain; Burtch, G., Ghose, A., Wattal, S., An empirical examination of the antecedents and consequences of contribution patterns in crowd-funded markets (2013) Information Systems Research, 24 (3), pp. 499-519; Burtch, G., Ghose, A., Wattal, S., Cultural differences and geography as determinants of online prosocial lending (2014) MIS Quarterly, 38 (3), pp. 773-794; Citi Group, Digital disruption, how FinTech is forcing banking to a tipping point (2016); De Reuver, M., Verschuur, E., Nikayin, F., Cerpa, N., Bouwman, H., Collective action for mobile payment platforms: a case study on collaboration issues between banks and telecom operators (2015) Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 14 (5), pp. 331-344; Demirguc-Kunt, A., Klapper, L., Singer, D., Oudheusden, P.V., The global findex database 2014: Measuring financial inclusion around the world (2015) Policy research working paper 7255, , World Bank Washington, DC; Foster, C., Heeks, R., Innovation and scaling of ICT for the bottom-of-the-pyramid (2013) Journal of Information Technology, 28 (4), pp. 296-315; Gelis, P., Why FinTech banks will rule the world (2016), John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, it is yet to be observed in Latvia to the same extent. This paper aims to evaluate fintech's level of development in Latvia compared to Europe. The paper identifies financial services using innovative technologies offered by fintech companies, analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these services in comparison with services offered by the traditional financial sector companies (banks, insurance companies, institutions involved in asset management and investment, etc.), and evaluates how prepared are consumers to use fintech services. This paper documents the results of the survey aiming to clarify how well-informed consumers in Latvia are about fintech services, their convenience, speed and safety, as well as the consumers' current satisfaction with banking services. The hypothesis of this paper is that Latvian society is not ready to use services provided by fintech, but prefers banking services instead. Survey results provide some evidence in favour of this hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally unaware about fintech services in Latvia and their associated innovations and new financial products. This paper makes several recommendations for managers of fintech enterprises, association of start-up enterprises and risk capital funds as well as state institutions.","Competition; Fintech; Innovation in financial services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) The Future of FinTech and Banking: Digitally Disrupted or Reimagined?, , https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-future-fintech-banking, Accenture; Anikina, I.D., Gukova, V.A., Golodova, A.A., Chekalkina, A.A., Methodological aspects of prioritization of financial tools for stimulation of innovative activities (2016) European Research Studies Journal, 19 (2), pp. 100-112; (2016) Consumers and Mobile Financial Services, , https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201603.pdf, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; (2015) Consumers and Mobile Financial Services, , https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/consumers-and-mobile-financial-services-report-201503.pdf, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; Chaia, A., Goland, T., Schiff, R., (2010) Counting the World's Unbanked, , http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/counting-the-worlds-unbanked; (2016) Opportuities for Mobile Financial Services to Engage Qualitative Research Findings, , https://www.fdic.gov/consumers/community/mobile/mfs_qualitative_research_report.pdf, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Fetai, B., Financial integration and financial development: Does financial integration matter?

Many of them are exploring blockchain applications to their multiple business lines, focusing in particular on post trading activities. Potential benefits include the reduction in counterparty risk and post trading costs as well as the increase of liquidity and transparency. At current stage exchanges are mainly exploring the technology looking for proofs of concept, with the exception of some more advanced projects like at Nasdaq and ASX. The mass adoption will require longer efforts and is expected to come in a decade, at least. Fintech developments are receiving strong attention also by regulators and international organizations, given the potential of distributed ledger technology for both competition enhancement and cyber risk reduction. A coordination between market players and regulators is essential to guarantee the effective implementation of new technologies, as their benefits can be delivered only in presence of a common framework and a proper management of risks. © 2017, Masaryk University.

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. Case description: This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. Discussion and evaluation: This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTech’s development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not “FinTech ready;” (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. Conclusion: The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bank 3.0; Co-opetition Theory; FinTech; Investment in FinTech; PARTS; Taiwan bank industry; Taiwan FinTech Industry",,,,,,"Total","• Financial Research and Data (79 startups, 824 M total funding)",,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia, , https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-fintech-investment-growth-continues-in-2016-driven-by-europe-and-asia-accenture-study-finds.htm, Accessed 10 Sept 2016; Benbasat, I., Goldstein, D.K., Mead, M., The case research strategy in studies of information systems (1987) MIS Q, 11 (3), pp. 369-386; Brandenburger, A., Nalebuff, B., (1996) Co-opetition, , Doubleday, New York; Cavaye, A.L., Case study research: a multi-faceted research approach for IS (1996) Inf Syst J, 6 (3), pp. 227-242; Chiu, L.T., Retrospect and prospect of financial industry development in Taiwan (2011) Econ Res, 11, pp. 171-197; (2015) Financial Supervisory Committee Big Data Project, , http://data.gov.tw/node/12077, Data.Gov.Tw, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2015) Construct Digital Finance Environments, , http://www.fsc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=96&parentpath=0,2&mcustomize=news_view.jsp&dataserno=201501130003&toolsflag=Y&dtable=News, Accessed 21 Sept 2016; (2015) The Act Governing Electronic Payment Institutions, , http://law.fsc.gov.tw/law/EngLawContent.aspx?Type=C&id=1802, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2015) Regulations of Bank and Financial Holding Company Investing Fintech Firms, , http://law.banking.gov.tw/Eng/FLAW/FLAWQRY03.aspx?lsid=FL078705&keyword=10460003280, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2015) Regulations of Industry of Information Service and Industry of Finance Technology Determined by the Competent Authority as Finance Related Industry, , http://law.banking.gov.tw/Eng/FLAW/FLAWQRY03.aspx?lsid=FL078705&keyword=10460003280, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2016) Financial Technology Area, , http://www.fsc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=478&parentpath=0,7, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2016) Basic Financial Data, , http://www.banking.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=157&parentpath=0,4&mcustomize=bstatistics_view.jsp&serno=201105120009, Accessed 30 Sept 2016; (2016) Fintech Development Strategy White Paper, , http://www.fsc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=96&parentpath=0,2&mcustomize=news_view.jsp&dataserno=201605120002&aplistdn=ou=news,ou=multisite,ou=chinese,ou=ap_root,o=fsc,c=tw&dtable=News, Accessed 4 Oct 2016; (2016) P2P Will Not Set up Regulation, , http://udn.com/news/story/7239/1793803, Accessed 10 Oct 2016; (2016), https://www.fintechweekly.com/fintech-definition, Fintech weekly (nd) Fintech definition, Accessed 26 Aug; Hill, C., Lynn, L., Producing human services why do agencies collaborate?

This paper explores the complexity of Fintech, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term Fintech and covering a period of more than 40 years. The objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application. As the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of Fintech using both spheres. Applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peerreviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that Fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities. The implications as well as the shortcomings of this definition are discussed. © 2021 Journal of Innovation Management.

In parallel with the regulatory changes, the banks are subject to pressure from accelerated technology development and social changes. These two factors influence the behavior of customers and induce changes in the customer relationship management (CRM). Taking the example of retail banking, the factors and their impacts are explained. Additionally, a view on the FinTech industry is presented, highlighting areas where traditional financial institutions are losing market share to technology-savvy and socially oriented new ventures with exceptional CRM capabilities.
