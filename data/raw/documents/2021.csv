This has put increasing pressure on banks to monitor and report a range of intricate exposures to comply with new prudential requirements. Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an emerging technology trend leveraging Information Technology and Digital Innovations that can greatly assist with a bank’s regulatory management process. A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned. RegTech can provide an invaluable tool, in a business-as-usual environment, as well as in real-life stress events, such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak. This paper explores the potential of RegTech and the merit of incorporating it into a smart Treasury department. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Coronavirus; Digital technology; Innovation; Regulations and compliance; Regulatory Technology (RegTech); Smart Treasury",,,"Grundke, P., Kuhn, A., The impact of the Basel III liquidity ratios on banks: Evidence from a simulation study (2020) The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 75, pp. 167-190; Fidrmuc, J., Lind, R., Macroeconomic impact of Basel III: Evidence from a meta-analysis (2020) Journal of Banking & Finance, 112, p. 105359; Boora, K.K., The impact of Basel III norms on profitability: An empirical study of Indian public sector banks (2018) IUP Journal of Financial Risk Management, 15 (3), pp. 44-58. , https://0-search.ebscohost.com.ujlink.uj.ac.za/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=133637292&site=ehost-live&scope=site.Accessed12Aug2020; Auboin, M., Blengini, I., The impact of Basel III on trade finance: The potential unintended consequences of the leverage ratio (2019) Journal of Banking Regulation, 20 (2), pp. 115-123; Roulet, C., Basel III: effects of capital and liquidity regulations on European bank lending (2018) Journal of Economics and Business, 95, pp. 26-46; Basheer, M.F., Hidthiir, M.H., Waemustafa, W., Impact of bank regulatory change and bank specific factors upon off-balance-sheet activities across commercial banks in south Asia (2019) Asian Economic and Financial Review, 9 (4), pp. 419-431. , http://www.aessweb.com/journals/April2019/5002/4531.Accessed12Aug2020; Alam, N., Ngo, K., Regulatory compliance and cost of banking operation: A survey of US banking sector (2014) Journal of International Banking Law & Regulation, 29 (11), pp. 657-664; Allen, M., Cost of compliance (2014) San Diego Business Journal, 35 (36), p. 15. , https://0-search.ebscohost.com.ujlink.uj.ac.za/login.aspx?direct=true&db=f5h&AN=98203184&site=ehost-live&scope=site; Howard, C., Basel III’s corporate governance impact: How increased banking regulations pose challenges to corporate compliance while simultaneously furthering stakeholder objectives (2014) Journal of Business Ethics, 9 (1), pp. 39-49. , https://0-search.ebscohost.com.ujlink.uj.ac.za/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=99899582&site=ehost-live&scope=site.Accessed12Aug2020; Financial Service Authority. 2019.

Despite multiple initiatives and regulatory changes, there is a need to revisit the reporting and regulatory frameworks and redefine the focus areas. Banks credit problem has often been explored under the lens of asymmetric information. Spreads are generally directly proportional to probability of default and an inverse function of collateral and security. However, in India, there is a noticeable gap in academic literature to suggest robust institutional reforms to address the twin curse of adverse selection and moral hazard. Regulatory frameworks, particularly with respect to risk management function of banks, also grapple with predicting forthcoming disruptions. As banks redesign their corporate customer experience on a digitalized scale, leveraging large-scale available data, there is a bigger challenge to the regulator to ensure risk regulations are effective and save costs as well. The authors suggest that if information asymmetry exists, the blockchain protocols may mitigate uncertainty. Though blockchain technology has been leveraged to increase effectiveness of certain corporate banking products, the originality of the paper lies in coming out with a detailed framework for the possible use of blockchain (a distributed ledger based technology) for credit decisions, timely generation of red-flags and tightening the regulatory framework. The paper also lists down suggestions to improve the enabling regulatory and reporting architecture using regulatory technology (RegTech) to support unification of data already available in the banking system. This will improve the quality of information available to the lenders and enable them to take more informed credit decisions (data-driven finance), while granting and monitoring loans. Ultimately, it will lead to an optimization of credit risk capital. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Bank regulations; Blockchain; Corporate banking; Distributed ledger technology; FinTech; Information asymmetry; Non-performing assets; RegTech; Reporting framework",,,"Junk, A., Daisuke, A., (2019) Economic Implications of Blockchain Platforms; Casino, F., Dasaklis, T.K., Patsakis, C., A systematic literature review of blockchain based applications: Current status, classification and open issues (2019) Telematics and Informatics, 36, pp. 55-81; Farell, L.M., Principal agency risk in project finance (2003) International Journal of Project Management, 21 (8), pp. 547-561; Will we realize Blockchain’s promise of decentralization?

The banking industry changed massively after the financial crisis of 2008. New regulations and enforcements are being imposed on banks causing the compliance cost to increase dramatically. RegTech has been invented by technology firms acting as a potential solution to banks. The study will demonstrate the ability of RegTech to reduce the compliance cost, strengthen money laundering prevention and reduce the reputational risk in banking sectors. This study target sample was banks’ employees in Bahrain because of their proper knowledge about anti-money laundering. Data were collected from 100 respondents from the banking sector of Bahrain. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the data while regression model and Spearman’s correlation were used to test the hypothesis. The results of this analysis indicate that RegTech has positive impact on strengthening and enhancing money laundering prevention in banks. The findings of the study will help banks understand the effectiveness of RegTech solutions, raise bankers’ awareness about the new technologies and provide insight for regulators about RegTech capabilities in preventing money laundering. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.","Anti-money laundering; Bahrain; Regulatory technology (RegTech)","Banking; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Anti-money laundering; Banking industry; Compliance costs; Descriptive analysis; Exploratory studies; Financial crisis; Money laundering; Regression model; Laundering",,"(2018) Implications of fintech developments for banks and banks supervisors, , https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d431.pdf, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision; (2012), CAMS: Study Guide for the CAMS Certification Examination (5th Ed).

It does not only present the applications, but also the regulation of AI and Financial Technology FinTech. An innovation regulatory framework at the regulation level and compulsory restrictive guidance and supervision for AI-based technology to allow sustainable growth will promote the accelerated growth of AI in finance. The AI in the financial industry itself focuses on the main characteristics of “digitalization”, “onlineization”, “remoteization”, “visualization”, and “intelligence”, building a multi-functional, all-process end-to-end system based on data, enabling multi-user multi-terminal concurrent office, intelligently assisting in dealing with problems and giving solutions. The advent of AI and its ever-broader effects on other industries demands an assessment of its influence on achieving sustainable development goals. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence (AI); COVID-19 pandemic; Finance 4.0; Finance and Treasury 4.0; Financial technology (FinTech); Regulatory technology (RegTech)",,,"Beier, G., Ullrich, A., Niehoff, S., Reißig, M., Habich, M., Industry 4.0: How it is defined from a sociotechnical perspective and how much sustainability it includes—A literature review (2020) J.

Fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic. This is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being. We have used the ‘bibliometrix 3.0’ package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically. The study suggests that ‘ACM International Conference Proceedings’ is the core source of published fintech literature. China leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications. Bina Nusantara University is the most relevant affiliation. Arner and Buckley provide impactful fintech literature. In the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes. These research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech. The study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams. These research streams are related to ‘cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology’, ‘financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech)’, and ‘machine learning and deep learning innovations’. The study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density. These various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics. © 2021 by the authors.

The paper describes a review of 88 refereed academic papers on the subject of FinTech published in journals that have high SJR2017 scores. Papers were categorised according to the type of companies leveraging FinTech (existing financial institutions vs. new entrants) and the type of value derived from FinTech innovation (new value-added vs. improved efficiency). Also considered were types of new value-added, geographical focus of the research and research methodologies. The largest number of studies concerned the use of FinTech innovation by new entrants to offer solutions to social issues or build new financial ecosystems. Over half the studies were on FinTech in Asia or the European Union, and the most common methodology employed was the case study.

Many organisations appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to assist them with their demonstration of compliance with the GDPR Principle of Accountability. The challenge for the DPO is to monitor these complex processing activities and to advise and inform the organisation with regard to the organisations demonstration of compliance with the Principle of Accountability. A review of GDPR compliance software solutions shows that organisations are being greatly challenged in meeting compliance obligations as set out under the GDPR, despite the myriad of software tools available to them. Many organisations continue to take a manual and informal approach to GDPR compliance. Our analysis shows significant gaps on the part of GDPR tools in their ability to demonstrate compliance in that they lack interoperability features, and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility. In contrast, RegTech has brought great success to financial compliance, using technological solutions to facilitate compliance with, and the monitoring of regulatory requirements. A review of the State of the Art identified the four success features of a RegTech system to be, strong data governance, automation through technology, interoperability of systems and a proactive regulatory framework. This paper outlines a set of requirements for GDPR compliance tools based on the RegTech experience and evaluate how these success features could be applied to improve GDPR compliance. A proof of concept prototype GDPR compliance tool was explored using the four success factors of RegTech, in which RegTech best practice was applied to regulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if the demonstration of GDPR compliance could be improved. The application of a RegTech success factors provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech can deliver and can facilitate organisations in meeting their GDPR compliance obligations. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Accountability; Compliance; Data protection officer; GDPR; RegTech","Demonstrations; Information systems; Information use; Interoperability; Privacy by design; Complex processing; Data governances; Geographical locations; Heterogeneous processing; Regulatory frameworks; Regulatory requirements; Software solution; Technological solution; Regulatory compliance","Acknowledgements.

The current European regulation on public communications networks is aware of this assumption and currently requires that Telecommunications Service Providers (TSPs) take appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of networks and services. In this context, risk management has become both a key aspect for dealing with security and a main trust vector included particularly in regulations. In this context, our paper concerns the establishment of a national security risk management framework to comply with national and European regulations for TSPs. This framework is composed of two parts: a security risk management tool to be used by the TSPs and an analysis tool to be used by the regulatory authority to gather and assess the risk management reports from the TSPs. The latter is specifically used to benchmark the security level of TSPs and the security of the sector as a whole. This paper reports on the design of this framework and the challenges emerging after an entire regulatory cycle. © 2020 Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology.

Roughly one trillion $ market value in less than thirty minutes vanished with the biggest one-day point decline in the history of the DJIA at the time. Since the market events took place in electronic markets, and algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, parts of FinTech, played significant roles, we handle the May 6 flash crash from the FinTech, SupTech, and financial supervision perspectives. With the flashback method, we analyzed the reactions of market participants, media, and two financial supervisors, the SEC, and the CFTC, to the market crash. We find that the technological imbalance between financial markets or institutions and their supervisors drove the markets in uncertainty, hence in a fear and panic environment. Since the imbalance has not diminished yet, the same risks still exist. As a remedy, we introduce a new concept and model with a well-functioning SupTech system to cope with the May 6 type FinTech crises. © 2021, The Author(s).","Digital finance; Financial authority; Financial crises; Financial stability; Financial supervision; Financial system; FinTech; FinTech crises; Inform-your-markets; Informational efficiency; Know-your-data; Know-your-markets; Know-your-technology; May 6 flash crash; Prudential supervisory disclosure; RegTech; Supervisory technology; SupTech; Systemically important data; Systemically important markets",,,"Ait-Sahalia, Y., Saglam, M., (2013) High Frequency Traders: Taking Advantage of Speed, , National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge; Anginer, D., Demirgüç-Kunt, A., Mare, S.D., Bank capital, institutional environment and systemic stability (2018) Journal of Financial Stability, pp. 97-106; Arner, D.W.J., Barberisbuckley, R.P., The emergence of RegTech 2.0: From know your customer to know your Data (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, pp. 79-86; BaFin, F., (2018) Big Data Meets Artificial Intelligence: Challenges and Implications for the Supervision and Regulation of Financial Services, , BaFin, Bonn; Bundesbank, B.D., (2020) Supervisory Disclosure.

This task is challenging as institutions need to upgrade their data and analytics capabilities to enable new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict and detect financial crimes. In this paper, we put a step towards AI-enabled financial crime detection in general and money laundering detection in particular to address this challenge.

However, the major application of Regtech in financial services is as a tool for regulatory compliance, rather than for regulatory enforcement. This article explores an approach to applying Regtech techniques to antitrust enforcement. It does this by applying those techniques to the detection of resale price maintenance (vertical price fixing). The exploration is limited to pricing on e-commerce platforms such as AliExpress, eBay, and Amazon Marketplace. The Regtech application is effected by presenting the literature and cases on resale price maintenance and the application of the law in Australia, the US, and the EU. The article examines the application of machine learning in the Regtech environment and the ways in which application programming interfaces could be used. The article proposes approaches to machine learning solutions for the detection of potentially infringing resale price maintenance conduct. It also presents the basis of an algorithm for detecting that conduct. © 2020 The Author(s).","antitrust; competition law; Fintech; Regtech; resale price maintenance; vertical price fixing",,"The author would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and Deniz Kayis, Michael Gvozdenovic, Nayan Bhathela, and Trent Wilson for research assistance on this article.

The Global Legal Entity Identifier System (GLEIS), was developed to enable financial regulators to trace the owners of financial assets and liabilities, which was revealed as a problem by the global financial crisis of 2008. This chapter focuses on one of the key controversies that arose as part of the development of GLEIS-the issue of data quality. The chapter uses the GLEIS case to explain how differing views among infrastructure participants about the development of a complex data-driven regulatory system are reconciled. It shows that establishing such a system involves the turning of publicly available data into valuable assets in a process the chapter calls ‘capitalization through certification’ and argue that this process is relevant to broader debates about the use of business intelligence and analytics tools and techniques for regulatory purposes. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Big data; Data capitalization; Data quality; Financial regulation; Identification infrastructures; Regtech",,,"Abbasi, A., Sarker, S., Chiang, R.H., Big Data Research in Information Systems: Toward an Inclusive Research Agenda (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Systems, 17 (2); Agarwal, R., Dhar, V., Editorial: Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics: The Opportunity and Challenge for IS research (2014) Information Systems Research, 25 (3), pp. 443-448; Arthur, W.B., Competing Technologies, Increasing Returns, and Lock-In by Historical Events (1989) The Economic Journal, 99 (394), pp. 116-131; Beynon-Davies, P., Form-ing Institutional Order: The Scaffolding of Lists and Identifiers (2016) Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67 (11), pp. 2738-2753; Callon, M., Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of St Brieuc Bay (1984) The Sociological Review, 32 (1), pp. 196-233; Callon, M., Society in the Making: The Study of Technology as a Tool for Sociological Analysis (1987) The Social Construction of Technological Systems: New Directions in the Sociology and History of Technology, pp. 83-103. , T.

The intensity of globalization processes leads to the economic integration of the economies and financial sectors of the countries of the world. The main trend of the modern financial sector is the accelerated introduction of technological innovations, innovative financial services and tools for their implementation. The use of digital technologies helps to reduce the cost of maintenance and operational risks. Creating a digital basis for serving consumers by finance companies increases their productivity and spurs more innovation in the financial arena. This, in turn, maintains the soundness of the financial sector. Restyling of financial services is based on the use of artificial intelligence and cloud technologies by financial companies, which allows to meet the needs and expectations of consumers. The use of tools for digital transformation of the financial sector provides maximum personalization, while using a large variety of parameters. Tracking and comparing changes in regulatory documents using RegTech and NLP provides an important area of activity for financial companies - compliance. An inevitable process is the virtualization of information interaction between financial sector entities based on the use of cloud technologies. However, the imperfection of these technologies at the moment does not allow them to be fully used. Therefore, in order to create favorable conditions for the introduction of innovations in the financial sector based on cloud technologies, it is necessary to implement a number of actions proposed in the article. The studies carried out allow us to assert that due to digital transformations of the financial sector, the efficiency of business processes increases and powerful advantages of its subjects are formed. But at the same time, there are some restrictions on their full implementation and risks on the way to the development of the digital financial sector in Ukraine. The proposed potential means of accelerated digitalization of the financial sector of the economy are in the large-scale and all-encompassing use of cloud technologies and artificial intelligence. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors","artificial intelligence; cloud technologies; digitalization; financial innovation; financial sector; ICT; RegTech; restyling","Artificial intelligence; Economics; Regulatory compliance; Cloud technologies; Digitalization; Financial companies; Financial innovation; Financial sectors; Financial service; ICT; Regtech; Restyling; Ukraine; Finance","This study was conducted at the Department of Finance, Banking and Insurance of Odessa I.I.

Through the convenience of social media platforms as a means of communication, content sharing and even payment between different users, black market transactions are now enabled by e-commerce. Tax authorities worldwide have voiced their concern over the difficulty to detect such transactions over the internet. This paper presents a machine learning based Regtech tool for international tax authorities to detect transaction-based tax evasion activities across social e-commerce. To build such a tool, we collected a dataset of 58, 660 Instagram posts and manually labelled 2, 041 sampled posts with multiple properties related to transaction-based tax evasion activities. Based on the dataset, we developed a multimodal deep neural network to automatically detect suspicious posts. The proposed model combines comments, hashtags and image modalities (including extracted from videos) to produce the final output. As shown by our experiments, the complementary combined model achieved sensitivity of 71.9 %, specificity of 87.5%, accuracy of 84.1 % and AUC of 0.837, outperforming any single modality models. This tool could help tax authorities to identify audit targets in an efficient and effective manner, and combat social e-commerce tax evasion in scale. © 2021 IEEE.","Deep neural networks; Regtech; Social e-commerce; Social media; Tax administration","Electronic commerce; Social networking (online); Taxation; Communications content; Content Sharing; E- commerces; Multi-modal; Regtech; Social e-commerce; Social media; Social media platforms; Tax authorities; Tax evasions; Deep neural networks",,"(2016) Strategies and Activities to Address the Cash and Hidden Economy, , Australian Taxation Office; Skinner, J., Slemrod, J., An economic perspective on tax evasion (1985) National Tax J., 38 (3), pp. 345-353; (2019) Thailand to Launch Value-added Tax in 2020, , pymnts.com; (2018) The Digital Archipelago: How Online Commerce Is Driving Indonesia's Economic Development, , McKinsey & Company; Gaspareniene, L., Remeikiene, R., Schneider, F.G., Concept, motives and channels of digital shadow economy: Consumers' attitude (2017) J.

These changes are detected by the proposed warning system that not only monitors changes in normative acts, but also gives an opportunity to analyse organizational data with the purpose of identifying performance of which legal entities could be negatively impacted by the changes in regulations and, thus, which entities are to be warned regarding the estimated consequences of regulatory changes. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Compliance; Document graphs; Normative document analysis; Performance analytics; RegTech; Warning system","Artificial intelligence; Compliance; Document graph; Documents analysis; Normative document analyse; Normative documents; Organisational; Performance; Performance analytic; Regtech; Research topics; Laws and legislation","Acknowledgments.

Such changes are due, in particular, to the concentration and scaling up and diversification of the structure of financial services, the renewal of the financial sector on the basis of FinTech operations and blockchain technologies. This requires taking into account the impact of innovation factors on the transformation of the financial market in the dimension of FinTech. The study aims to identify the imperatives of global financial innovation and show ways to develop innovative models in the interpretation of S-curves for next-generation products using new technologies when key technologies on the previous S-curve become obsolete. Also, the matrix of financial innovations is presented and the synergy of its innovation models is proved. The results of the study are to prove that each of the presented models is not independent, it evolves and develops itself, as well as affects other models. This made it possible to identify prognostic pathways for the development of innovative models in their synergy in the form of two-ring motion. Thus, the study emphasizes the need for further research aimed at developing innovative models that will determine strategic decisions in the formation of innovation imperatives. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

The study tried to address the general concept of electronic Signatures and the essential legal laws that regulate its application. Based on the analysis of the reality of the electronic Signature’s uses and applications in Palestine, the researcher found that it is not applied at all in all banking and non-banking financial sectors. It is only adopted at the Palestine Stock Exchange. The electronic Signature is optional in most transactions and trades between the Stock Exchange and the brokerage firms and their clients, which are conducted electronically. The study also tried to shed some light on and highlight the most critical legal and illegal obstacles that hinder using and applying electronic Signatures in the Palestinian business sector. The researchers came up with many recommendations. The most important recommendation relates to the establishment of an electronic transactions unit as stipulated in the Law and that it should be independent. They also recommended that the private sector companies be allowed to design and implement the programs necessary for electronic Signatures and the protection and securing of the electronic Signature. © Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

COVID 19 gave a big push to fintech products all over the world; Oman is no exception. People prefer to use touchless financial services. It is revolutionizing the finance and other industries with digital technology that helps develop financial activities and improve the flow of financial transactions as well as provide a seamless experience to customers. This new technology also impacts the Middle Eastern region and the Gulf Cooperative Countries (GCC). In contrast, a country like Oman has embraced this new technology development in both the public and private sectors. This chapter will focus specifically on Oman and describe how Fintech embraced and implemented there. This chapter will also examine how it is impacting the Omani banking and finance industry at present and what would be the future trends.

Part of the solution appears to be programming compliance into RegTech: technological solutions that facilitate compliance with and monitoring of regulatory requirements. In this contribution, we have distinguished three types of RegTech based on the party taking the initiative for its development: (i) Compliance RegTech, where financial institutions develop or acquire RegTech tools to facilitate compliance; (ii) Supervisory RegTech, where a supervisor imposes the use of a certain RegTech tool to facilitate compliance, supervision and/or enforcement; and (iii) Regulatory RegTech, where the regulator provides machine-readable and/or machine-executable regulation. This approach allows for a nuanced analysis of the benefits and challenges of RegTech, and of the changing role of supervisors in a RegTech era. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation (2017) Nw J Int’l L & Bus, 37, p. 371; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2017) FinTech and RegTech in a Nutshell, and the Future in a Sandbox, 3 (4). , Research Foundation Briefs July; Arner, D.W., Zetzsche, D.A., Buckley, R.P., Barberis, J.N., FinTech and RegTech.

After focusing on the main current trends in FinTech regulation within the EU, and on the related phenomenon of RegTech, this chapter aims to explore the recent developments in SupTech and to assess how the employment of technology-enabled solutions is changing the way authorities perform their functions. The spread of SupTech could enhance supervisory capabilities while fostering a more flexible and collaborative approach towards the regulated institutions, representing a paradigm shift in the relationship between regulation and supervision. These changes pose new challenges to the current institutional framework and to the underlying public law accountability principles. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock;

Many financial institutions are struggling with ever-changing regulatory requirements and the increased burden of intricate rules. Such rules can be conflicting, and subjected to local implementation and jurisdictic interpretation. Non-compliance or the inability to meet the deadlines subject institutions to hefty penalties and multimillion-dollar fines for failures in controlling nefarious and over-the-counter trading activities. In this chapter, we map out ongoing regulatory milestones globally to understand the main supervisory priorities by territory and propose how financial institutions can successfully administer regulatory change through an AI-driven regulatory management model within their organizations. We discuss the evolution, challenges and recommendations for financial institutions (including Shariah compliance) in the change management for regulations using a structured approach that addresses regional priorities. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-money laundering; Customer due diligence; Data privacy and protection; OTC reform",,,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern J.
