At the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater – it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation. This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of RegTech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries. © 2017.

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation",,"Finally, only a few companies around the world are able to quickly export their fintech/regtech products and services to other countries. These are usually the ‘first movers’ and they are strongly financed by established financial markets and supported by advanced technology-platforms for scaling. For smaller markets, the small and medium-sized companies potentially face the future scaling and funding problem. Such companies may already be partially successful in their respective markets but further expansion financing for growth and internationalisation can come across the ‘bottleneck’ consequence. Much of the decline in the number of ‘smaller’ companies becoming listed is attributed to the very difficulty of being a small public company; this is reflected in the actions of venture capitalists, who once sought public listings when they wanted to exit their investments and now overwhelmingly choose private sales (Ritter, Economist, 2018 ). There is thus the real potential that firms are going to seek strategic alliances with incumbent financial institutions within the sector as their survival strategy. The risk for promising fintech/start-up companies is that there is also the potential to be constricted under the pressure of having to meet invariable demands in the services and products they offer. As such the issue becomes one of scale and capacity against larger firms, possibly the incumbents or indeed technology giants (i.e. Amazon, Apple etc.). This is important as at this stage. This is an industry with no ‘made’, crisis-resistant, proven businesses thus far. We do not know yet whether start-ups are mentally prepared for ‘exchanges’ in order to finance growth. In an industry under exponential development, pure cash exits do not exist as well for venture capital nor do acquisition evaluation models of a ‘made’ fintech business exist. Established institutions have the scale to absorb this which potentially gives rise to growth through a mergers and acquisitions wave. A pragmatic way for mergers to go through at this point is via exchanges of shares. The dangers in such a scenario are the ‘old-new firms’ where they ‘grow-and-consume’ entrants.",,,"Accenture, Global fintech investment growth continues in 2016 driven by Europe and Asia, accenture study finds (2016), https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-fintech-investment-growth-continues-in-2016-driven-by-europe-and-asia-accenture-study-finds.htm, April 13 News Release; Agarwal, S., Lucca, D., Seru, A., Trebbi, F., Inconsistent regulators: Evidence from banking (2014) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129 (2), pp. 889-938; Aggarwal, R., Stein, P., The complex regulatory landscape for FinTech: An Uncertain future for small and medium-sized enterprise lending (2016), World Economic Forum White Paper No. 170816; Allan, G., Hagiwara, Y., Japan regulation shakeup is seen as a game changer for banks (2018), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/japan-finance-regulation-shakeup-seen-as-game-changer-for-banks, February 26, Accessed 10/03/2018 Bloomberg; Allen, F., Gale, D., Financial intermediaries and markets (2004) Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 72 (4), pp. 1023-1061; Allen, F., Gale, D., Understanding financial crises, clarendon lectures in finance (2007), Oxford University Press; Allen, F., Gale, D., Bubbles and crises (2000) The Economic Journal, 110 (460), pp. 236-255; Allen, F., Gale, D., Financial contagion (2000) The Journal of Political Economy, 108 (1), pp. 1-33; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the Re- conceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37 (3), pp. 371-413; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of FinTech: A new post-crisis paradigm?

The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. The first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-KYC systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems. The third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments. The fourth pillar—design of digital financial markets and systems—supports broader access to finance and investment. Implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through FinTech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development. © 2020, T.M.C.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly popular in the financial industry due to its ability to provide customers with cheap, efficient and personalised services. This article uses doctrinal sources and a case study to show that many banks and FinTech start-ups are investing in AI. Yet, there are a number of challenges arising from the use of AI which could undermine trust and confidence amongst consumers. This article features the issue of bias and discrimination in banking. There is evidence that algorithms discriminate against certain races and gender. Legislative gaps in the Equality Act 2010 and the General Data Protection Regime will be analysed. Ultimately, human beings are still needed to input, train and help machines to learn. Fortunately, the FCA are leading in regulating technology, from the launch of regulatory sandboxes to their co-operative collaboration with FinTech start-ups on regulatory matters. Augmented intelligence collaboration is needed to enable industry players and regulators to provide seamless regulation and financial stability. The future of AI regulation is interdisciplinary in approach. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Artificial intelligence; Augmented intelligence collaboration; Financial regulation; FinTech; RegTech",,"‘This work was supported by the Faculty of Arts, Professional and Social Studies of Liverpool John Moores University under a qualitative research grant’.",,,"Baum, L.F., The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, , (First published 1900, Chicago: Geo.

The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings: This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The paper reports that FinTech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the FinTech industry – from academia to practitioners to regulators. Practical implications: The paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for FinTech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators. Originality/value: The paper is believed to add value to the understanding of FinTech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Cryptocurrency; Entrepreneurial finance; FinTech; ICOs; Innovation; P2P lending; Regtech; Regulatory sandbox; Shadow banking",,,,,"Adhami, S., Giudici, G., Martinazzi, S., Why do businesses go crypto?

A new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy. At the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses. However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers’ rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology. This dynamic and flexible financial regulatory system could effectively address fintech risks. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","fintech; regtech; technology-driven regulation",,"This article is a research project called Legal Issues of Technology-Driven Financial Regulation (Project Number: 17BFX098), which is sponsored by Chinese Social Science Fund.",,,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of fintech: A new post-crisis paradigm (2015) Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, pp. 1271-1319; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., FinTech and regtech in a nutshell, and the future in a sandbox.” CFA institute (2017) Research Foundation Briefs, 3 (4). , https://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2470/rfbr.v3.n4.1/; Bian, W., Shan, W., Development of fintech and the regulatory sandbox—comparative analysis based on several important countries (2017) Financial Regulation, 7, pp. 85-98. , –,.

While a few isolated suits might be successful in cases where there is provable fraud, such remedies are no general panacea for preventing large-scale bank-inflicted losses. Large losses are nearly always the result of unforeseeable or suddenly changing economic conditions, poor business judgment, or inadequate regulatory supervision-usually a combination of all three. Yet regulators face an increasingly complex task in supervising modern financial institutions. This Article explains how the challenge has become so difficult. It argues for preserving regulatory discretion rather than reducing it through formal congressional direction. The Article also asserts that regulators have to develop their own sophisticated methods of automated supervision. Although also not a panacea, the development of ""RegTech"" solutions will help clear away volumes of work that understaffed and underfunded regulators cannot keep up with. RegTech will not eliminate policy considerations, nor will it render regulatory decisions noncontroversial. Nevertheless, a sophisticated deployment of RegTech should help focus regulatory discretion and public-policy debate on the elements of regulation where choices really matter. © 2016 Lawrence G.

Blockchain (BC) technology, being distributed and immutable in nature, has proved to the 'Trust Machine' eliminating the need for third-parties. Authors of this paper investigate how Blockchain can be used to secure stock exchange transactions, with an especial focus to the technological as well as legal aspects of such applications. Considering the intricate operational structure of the securities exchange, the research proposes to design, develop and implement a hybrid BC, customised according to the need of the respective stock exchange. The study suggests that the use of such BC can bring many benefits which the other technologies currently being used cannot offer. However, during the design process of any such application using BC, the relevant laws and regulations of the corresponding country need to be considered. © 2018 IEEE.","Blockchain; Distributed Ledger; FinTech; LawTech; RegTech; Securities Exchange; Stock Exchange","Financial markets; Laws and legislation; Security of data; Distributed Ledger; FinTech; LawTech; RegTech; Stock exchange; Blockchain","ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research is funded by the Centre for Financial Regulation and Economic Development (CFRED), The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong.",,,"David, C., Donald, (2012) The Hong Kong Stock and Futures Exchanges: Law and Microstructure, , 1st ed.

At the same time, identification and know-your-customer rules can be major barriers to accessing financial services. This paper considers the various requirements for identification in the financial sector and the evolving nature of identity. We argue that technology presents an opportunity to solve this challenge through the development of digital identity infrastructure and related utilities. The establishment of such utilities requires addressing design questions such as registration methods, data availability, and cross-jurisdiction recognitions. Yet, as with any reform, a balance between flow through efficiency and cyber-security needs to be reached to ensure that the objectives of financial inclusion and market integrity are not achieved to the detriment of financial stability. © 2019, T.M.C.

Yet little is really understood about its meaning, legal implications, and policy consequences. In this article we introduce DeFi, put DeFi in the context of the traditional financial economy, connect DeFi to open banking, and end with some policy considerations. We suggest that decentralization has the potential to undermine traditional forms of accountability and erode the effectiveness of traditional financial regulation and enforcement. At the same time, we find that where parts of the financial services value chain are decentralized, there will be a reconcentration in a different (but possibly less regulated, less visible, and less transparent) part of the value chain. DeFi regulation could, and should, focus on this reconcentrated portion of the value chain to ensure effective oversight and risk control. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, in fact DeFi requires regulation in order to achieve its core objective of decentralization. Furthermore, DeFi potentially offers an opportunity for the development of an entirely new way to design regulation: the idea of ‘embedded regulation’. Regulatory approaches could be built into the design of DeFi, thus potentially decentralizing both finance and its regulation, in the ultimate expression of RegTech. © The Author(s) 2020.

The paper analyses these four pillars and suggests that together they are underpinning the development of a RegTech ecosystem in Europe and will continue to do so. We argue that the European Union’s financial services and data protection regulatory reforms have unintentionally driven the use of regulatory technologies (RegTech) by intermediaries, supervisors and regulators, and provided an environment within which RegTech can flourish. The experiences of Europe in this process will provide insights for other societies in developing their own RegTech ecosystems in order to support more efficient, stable, inclusive financial systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Data protection;

The financial crisis with serious corporate and mutual fund scandals raised the profile of compliance as governmental bodies, institutional and private investors introduced a ‘tsunami’ of financial regulations. Adopting a multi-level analysis, this study examines how regulatory technology was used by financial firms to meet their compliance obligations, pre- and post-crisis. Empirical data collected over 12 years examine the deployment of an investment management system in eight financial firms. Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology. Responding to these challenges, regulatory bodies continue to impose revised compliance mandates on financial firms to force them to adapt their financial technologies in an ever-changing multi-jurisdictional regulatory landscape. © 2017, Association for Information Technology Trust.","accountability; compliance systems; ethics; financial crisis; financial technology; fintech; regtech; regulatory technology; surveillance","Financial markets; Information management; Investments; Monitoring; Privatization; Space surveillance; Transparency; accountability; ethics; Financial crisis; fintech; regtech; Regulatory compliance",,,,"Aloui, R., Aïssa, M.S.B., Nguyen, D.K., Global Financial Crisis, Extreme Interdependences, and Contagion Effects: The Role of Economic Structure?

This would be achieved by sharing certain elements of the dynamic transaction document on a bearer service, based on a federation of distribution ledgers; such a quasi-simultaneous sharing of risk data becomes possible because the dynamic transaction document maintain a record of state in semi-real time, and this state can be verified by anybody with access to the distribution ledgers, also in semi-real time. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a novel, regular technology (RegTech) cum automated legal text approach for financial transaction as well as financial risk reporting that is based on cutting-edge distributed computing and decentralised data management technologies such as distributed ledger (Swanson, 2015), distributed storage (Arner et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2013; Caron et al., 2014), algorithmic financial contract standards (Brammertz and Mendelowitz, 2014; Breymann and Mendelowitz, 2015; Braswell, 2016), automated legal text (Hazard and Haapio, 2017) and document engineering methods and techniques (Glushko and McGrath, 2005). This approach is equally inspired by the concept of the “bearer service” and its capacity to span over existing and future technological systems and substrates (Kavassalis et al., 2000; Clark, 1988). Findings: The result is a transformation of supervisors’ capacity to monitor risk in the financial system based on data which preserve informational content of financial instruments at the most granular level, in combination with a mathematically robust time stamping approach using blockchain technology. Practical implications: The RegTech approach has the potential to contain operational risk linked to inadequate handling of risk data and to rein in compliance cost of supervisory reporting. Originality value: The present RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and supervisory reporting is the first integration of algorithmic financial data standards with blockchain functionality. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Algorithmic standards; Document engineering; RegTech; Smart contracts",,,,,"Acharya, V.V., Mehran, H., Thakor, A.V., Caught between Scylla and Charybdis?

The idea is to replace rules written in natural legal language with computer code and to use artificial intelligence for regulatory purposes. This new way of designing regulatory rules is in line with the UK government’s vision for the country to become a global leader in digital technology. It is also reflected in the FCA’s business plan. The article reviews the technology and the advantages and disadvantages of combining the technology with regulatory law. It then informs the discussion from a broader perspective. It analyses regulatory technology through criteria developed in the mainstream regulatory debate. It contributes to that debate by anticipating problems that will arise as the technology evolves. In addition, the hope is to assist the government in avoiding mistakes that have occurred in the past and creating a better system from the start. © 2019, The Author(s).","Algorithmic regulation; Artificial intelligence;

The rate at which technology has developed in terms of tasks that are complex, technical and time-consuming has been astounding. The purpose of this paper is to explore the solutions that AI, RegTech and CharityTech provide to charities in navigating the vast amount of anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance legislation in the UK; so that they comply with the requirements and mitigate the potential risk they face but also develop a more coherent and streamlined set of actions. Design/methodology/approach: The subject is approached through the analysis of data, literature and, domestic and international regulation. The first part of the paper explores the current obligations and risks charities face, these are then, in the second part, set against the examination of potential technological solutions as of August 2020. Findings: It is suggested that charities underestimate the importance of the nature and size of the threat posed to them, this is significant, as demonstrated, given the growing size and impact of the sector. Technological solutions are suggested to combat the issues charities face. Originality/value: The study is original because it is the first to create the notion of CharityTech and to specifically explore what technological advances can assist charities in meeting the regulatory compliance challenge. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anti-money laundering; Artificial intelligence; CharityTech; Counter-terror finance; English law; RegTech",,"The Commission is funded by the UK government and like Companies House, undertakes the registration process and maintains the register and can also deregister (close down) a charity.

A survey of GDPR compliance software solutions shows significant gaps in their ability to demonstrate compliance. In contrast, RegTech has recently brought great success to financial compliance, resulting in reduced risk, cost saving and enhanced financial regulatory compliance. It is shown that many GDPR solutions lack interoperability features such as standard APIs, meta-data or reports and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility. A proof of concept prototype was explored using a regulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if RegTech best practice could improve the demonstration of GDPR compliance. The application of a RegTech approach provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech can deliver. This paper demonstrates a RegTech approach to GDPR compliance can facilitate an organisation meeting its accountability obligations.

RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of know-your-customer requirements. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater - it could enable close to real-time monitoring and a proportionate regulatory regime that addresses risk and facilitates more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach that sits at the nexus between data, digital identity, and regulation. We seek to expose the inadequacy and lack of ambition of simply digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world. The development of financial technology ('FinTech'), rapid developments in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators in developing regulatory sandboxes, represent a unique combination of events, which could facilitate the transition from one regulatory model to another. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Bahrain has strived to position itself as the banking center of the Arabian Gulf, hence the results of this novel research are informative of the practices in the region. The primary data for this study was collected through a survey instrument distributed to 100 bankers working in Bahrain with expertise in compliance. The results of multivariate analysis indicate that transactions monitoring through RegTech and cost- and time-saving aspects of RegTech, drive money laundering prevention effectiveness to a highly statistically significant extent. However, electronic know your customer (KYC) technologies are insignificant as drivers. This research not only sheds light on the efficacy of RegTech but also raises general awareness concerning the adoption and integration of RegTech platforms for fighting money laundering. In particular, the findings provide specific insights about the deployment of RegTech capabilities in banks in regional banking centers of modest scale. © 2020 The AuthorsRegulatory technology (RegTech); Anti money laundering (AML); Know your customer (KYC) Compliance; Business Management; Business Policy; Corporate finance; International Finance; Sustainable Business. © 2020 The Authors","Anti money laundering (AML); Business management; Business policy; Corporate finance; International finance; Know your customer (KYC) compliance; Regulatory technology (RegTech); Sustainable business",,,,,"Anagnostopoulos, I., Fintech and regtech: impact on regulators and banks (2018) J.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on two online Delphi surveys sent to a panel of international experts composed of eight specially recruited professionals and specialists of anti-financial crime compliance and RegTech, five main predictions have been developed. Findings: It was found that artificial intelligence would become the most impactful technology for financial institutions to fight financial crime, and that there will be a strong positive correlation between ever-more elaborated compliance programs and the level of sophistication of methods used for money laundering. Furthermore, the panel designated regulators’ recommendations as likely to be less influential than RegTech solutions, and the time required to integrate RegTech solutions for AML compliance as the main future challenge. Originality/value: These predictions are meant to provide financial institutions and regulators with useful outlooks. While the reviewed literature focused on the role of regulations on the evolution of money laundering, this study puts stress on RegTech solutions and their impact on both compliance and financial crime. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Compliance; Financial crime; Money laundering; RegTech; Technology",,,,,"(2017) Evolving AML journey, , www.accenture.com/t00010101t000000z__w__/gb-en/_acnmedia/pdf-61/accenture-leveraging-machine-learning-anti-money-laundering-transaction-monitoring.pdf; Anagnostopoulos, I., Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks (2018) Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37 (3), pp. 373-415. , https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njilb/vol37/iss3/2; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The emergence of regtech 2.0: from know your customer to know your data (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, 44, pp. 79-86. , https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ris:jofitr:1576; Araujo, R.A., An evolutionary game theory approach to combat money laundering (2010) Journal of Money Laundering Control, 13 (1), pp. 70-78. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13685201011010236; Baldwin, G., The new face of money laundering (2003) Journal of Investment Compliance (Compliance), 4 (1), p. 38; Barone, R., Masciandaro, D., Organized crime, money laundering and legal economy: Theory and simulations (2011) European Journal of Law and Economics, 32 (1), pp. 115-142. , https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:kap:ejlwec:v:32:y:2011:i:1:p:115-142; Bergström, M., The many uses of anti-Money laundering regulation – over time and into the future (2018) German Law Journal, 19 (5), p. 1149. , http://search.ebscohost.com.thebe.icn-nancy.fr/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edb&AN=132846601&site=eds-live&scope=site; Butler, T., Brooks, R., On the role of ontology-based RegTech for managing risk and compliance reporting in the age of regulation (2017) Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, 11 (1), pp. 19-33. , http://search.ebscohost.com.thebe.icn-nancy.fr/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=128878068&site=eds-live&scope=site; (2019) The global financial crisis and its unforeseen consequences, , http://coriolistechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ten-years-on-from-the-GFCvFinal2.pdf, Retrieved from; Crosman, P., Is regulators’ green light on AML tech a game changer?

Mapping and analysing the plethora of legal implications of rapidly further evolving financial technology have gained momentum. The paper aims to contribute to it. Focus is on the German view. The following questions have inspired the analysis: How might FinTech best be defined and its most important manifestations best be systematized for legal purposes? Have the most pressing legal issues been addressed, so far? The paper considers the legal challenges of FinTech as huge, reaching far beyond financial markets. It argues that artificial intelligence and machine learning deserve utmost attention particularly in this context. The paper postulates that the law-being well-equipped to control the complex, constantly morphing risks of financial innovation while allowing exploiting its benefits-shall not just react to but lead the transformation. The present author considers particularly legal academia responsible for continuously steering and shaping a balanced and objective discourse leading to adequate legal responses in the realm of FinTech. It is time to reassert the crucial role of law in times of deep technological change not only in financial markets. 'It is a world of change-unparalleled, unsettling, dizzying change. The certainties of yesterday are the doubts of today, and the folly and mockery of tomorrow.

It also examines the potential impact FinTech has on the riskiness of banks and proposes RegTech as the solution. Following a brief overview of the impact and costs of regulation since the financial crisis, the paper introduces RegTech in the context of challenges facing financial institutions and the limitations of governance, risk and compliance (GRC) systems. This paper’s main contribution is in its delineation of a regulatory compliance and risk ontology, the technologies that underpin it and the related objective-risk-control (ORC) model. The paper argues that these provide a platform on which RegTech can perform effective risk management and compliance reporting in a global post-crisis regulatory environment. © Henry Stewart Publications 1752-8887 (2018).","Compliance reporting; Fintech; Regtech; Regulation; Risk management; Semantic technology",,,,,"Taylor, H., (2007) The Joy of SOX, , Wiley Publishing, Inc., Indianapolis, Ind; McClean, C., Rasmussen, M.T., (2007) The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Governance, Risk, and Compliance Platforms, , Forrester Inc., Cambridge, MA, 21st December; (2017) Regdelta: Part of Our Mifid II Solution, , https://jwg-it.eu/insight/mifid-programme-planner/, accessed 25th October, 2017; Grasshoff, G., Mogul, Z., Pfuhler, T., Gittfried, N., Wiegand, C., Bohn, A., Vonhoff, V., (2017) Global Risk 2017: Staying the Course In, , https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/financial-institutions-growth-global-risk-2017-staying-course-banking.aspx, available at, (accessed 25th October, 2017); Memminger, M., Baxter, M., Lin, E., (2016) Banking Regtechs to the Rescue?, Bain Brief, , http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/banking-regtechs-to-the-rescue.aspx, 18th September, available at, (accessed 25th October, 2017); McDowell, H., Banks spent close to $100 billion on compliance last year (2017) The Trade, , https://www.thetradenews.com/Sell-side/Banks-spent-close-to-$100-billion-on-compliance-last-year/, accessed 25th October, 2017; Marenzi, M., (2017) Capital Markets and Investment Banking 2017–2018 Forecast, , http://www.opimas.com/research/193/detail/, accessed 25th October, 2017; Peirce, H., Robinson, I., Stratmann, T., How are small banks faring under Dodd-Frank?

The rise of fintech driven by nonbank entities (technology startups, finance, big tech and big retail companies) helps to transform financial services industry, but also threatens the market positions of traditional banks and through them potentially the stability of the financial system. The current EU proposals, as presented in the Commission’s Fintech Action Plan published in 2018 and follow-up measures, outlined a number of steps to support fintech, while ensuring the protection of market stability and consumers and the maintenance of level playing field in the financial services markets. The article argues that, while the Commission’s proposed policy mix contains certain positive measures for fintech, it remains, overall, conservative and favours the incumbents. It also argues that unless the Commission becomes bolder and adopts a more flexible legal framework for fintech (for which the article makes specific recommendations), the latter will not grow at the pace needed to help build a competitive advantage for the EU financial sector. The Commission’s continuing support of the established market landscape dominated by financial conglomerates employing traditional business models risks undermining the ability of the European financial system to adapt to the changing competition landscape created by advancing financial technologies and to fully address stability concerns, which emerged as a result of the financial crisis ©2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","artificial intelligence; big data; crowdfunding; crypto-assets; EU; fintech; GDPR; plan; regtech; regulation",,,,,"His research interests include Banking & Finance Law, Law of Information Technology, Commercial Law, Law of Sustainable Development and Competition Law, , 1 Senior Lecturer in Banking & Finance Law, University for Bradford, United Kingdom.

Design/methodology/approach: In this research, an implementation procedure for a selected Process Mining application is developed and evaluated at a financial institution in Germany. Findings: The evaluation of the process data with the Process Mining application Disco shows that the compliance of the real-life execution of business processes can be monitored in real-time. Moreover, potential non-compliant activities and durations can be analysed in a detailed manner. Research limitations/implications: When the research results are regarded, it must be considered that a general condition for the usage of a Process Mining application is that the process data is available and exportable in the required format and that data privacy regulations are fulfilled. Originality/value: This research presents a practical use case for the implementation of a Process Mining application at the risk management department of financial institutions. It shows the value of using a technical application to carry out tedious tasks that are usually executed manually. This value is discussed and compared with the aim to help financial institutions in determining how the effectiveness and efficiencies of compliance management activities can be improved. Therefore, this research can be taken as a foundation for the practical implementation of a Process Mining application at financial institutions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Compliance management; Financial regulation; Process mining; RegTech; Regulatory compliance",,,,,"Allen, F., Goldstein, I., Jagtiani, J., The interplay among financial regulations, resilience, and growth (2018) Journal of Financial Services Research, 53 (2-3), pp. 141-162; (2017) Rundschreiben 09/2017 (BA) - Mindestanforderungen an das Risikomanagement -MaRisk, , www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Rundschreiben/2017/rs_1709_marisk_ba.html, (accessed: 23 December 2017; Becker, M., Buchkremer, R., Ranking of current information technologies by risk and regulatory compliance officers at financial institutions – a German perspective (2018) The Review of Finance and Banking, 10 (1), pp. 7-26; Becker, J., Delfmann, P., Dietrich, H.A., Steinhorst, M., Eggert, M., Business process compliance checking – applying and evaluating a generic pattern matching approach for conceptual models in the financial sector (2016) Information Systems Frontiers, 18 (2), pp. 359-405; Bergener, P., Delfmann, P., Weiss, B., Winkelmann, A., Detecting potential weaknesses in business processes.

One such piece of legislation is the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which intends to further define a common legal framework for the payment market in the European Economic Area, with the aim of increasing the level of integration and efficiency in the market, as well as increasing the level of consumer protection. In this context, the enhancement of collaborative infrastructures can be the keystone to anticipate and transform the challenges of PSD2 into opportunities. This paper describes the creation of an open banking platform, called CBI Globe — Global Open Banking Ecosystem, to facilitate the interconnection between banks and third parties through application programming interfaces, in line with the new directive.

The customer’s identity must be verified using at least two of the following items: (1) knowledge — something only the user knows (eg PIN, password); (2) possession — something only the user possesses (eg a card, a mobile phone); and (3) inherence: something the user is (biometric identification like fingerprint, iris or voice recognition etc). For all remote internet and mobile transactions there is an extra element: a unique authentication code which dynamically links the transaction to a specific amount and specific payee. For more information, see: European Payments Council (2018) ‘Understanding the final regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication under PSD2’, accessed 16th November, 2018; The European Commission Maintains Details on Payment Services (PSD2) Transposition Status, , https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/payment-services-directive-transposition-status_en; https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018R0389, The role of the Regulatory Technical Standard (RTS) on Strong Customer Authentication and Common and Secure open standards of Communication is to define specific security measures that were only addressed through general principles in PSD2, and to ensure effective and secure communication between the relevant stakeholders. These measures are directly applicable in EU member states and do not have to be transposed into national law. The RTS has been drafted by the European Banking Authority and has been adopted by the Commission. See: European Commission (2018) ‘Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/389 of 27 November 2017 supplementing Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication’, accessed 16th November, 2018; Consorzio CBI has around 440 consortium members, representing 95 per cent of the Italian banking sector. For over 20 years, thanks to the governance over a cooperative infrastructure, it has been guaranteeing the implementation of many services which each bank offers competitively to its clients, including the CBI Service which supports multi-bank enterprises in managing corporate treasury and e-invoicing; the Gateway Services for the Central Public Administration, which enable the financial sector to access the public administrations in a centralised way; the CBILL Service for the consultation and the digital payment of bills and of pagoPA payment notifications; and the Big Data CBI Service offered to banks to increase their predictive analysis capabilities through analytical models built on ‘Big Data’ paradigms. Consorzio CBI is undertaking additional projects in the PSD2 field, including the implementation of PSD2 compliant technical specifications APIs and the CBI Globe —Global Open Banking Ecosystem platform, which will allow all members, even across Europe, to simplify the fulfilment of their PSD2 obligations regarding communication with TPPs, while also enhancing the level of protection for consumers; A combination of the words ‘regulatory’ and ‘technology’, a ‘RegTech’ platform (or company)uses new technologies, such as Big Data, cloud-based services, blockchain or artificial intelligence, to support efficient regulatory management via IT.

Within 40 years the country went from a mono-bank model to one composed of hundreds of wholly-owned State banks and joint stock commercial banks. Yet this diversification has the banking landscape has not resolves credit allocation inefficiency. Indeed, whilst SME represent 80 % of the economic output of the country, it is only receiving 20 % of the credit originated by banks. This has spurred the development of shadow banking, an informal and unregulated network of lenders and borrowers. The emergence of Financial Technology has allowed for this activity digitized itself in the form of Peer-to-peer lending channel. The combination of and unregulated market and large credit gap has lead to the emergence of a sector that had only one platform in 2007 and over 2000 in 2015. Therefore the author submit that the emergence of the P2P sector in China is neither new, nor unexpected. Ultimately, this systemic shift caused by the P2P sector offers China a regulatory and market reform opportunity as the shadow has been brought to the light. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","China; Financial globalization; Financial innovation; Financial regulation; Financial technology; FinTech; RegTech; Regulatory technology",,,,,"(2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 84; Zhou, W., Arner, D.W., Buckley, R.P., (2015) Regulation of Digital Financial Services in China: Last Mover Or First Mover?, , http://ssrn.com/abstract=2660050; (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 63. , 2nd edition; The China Development Bank (CDB) and the China Exim Bank (CEB); Martin, M.F., Chinas Banking System: Issues for Congress’ (2012) Congressional Research Service, p. 2; Cheng, J., (2012) China: A New Stage of Development for an Emerging Superpower, p. 336. , City of University Hong Kong Press; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 54. , 2nd edition; Martin, M.F., China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress (2012) Congressional Research Service, p. 26; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 84. , 2nd edition; Arner, D.W., (2007) Financial Stability, Economic Growth, and the Role of Law, p. 225. , Cambridge University Press; Martin, M.F., ; Bell, S., Feng, H., The Rise of the People’s Bank of China (2013) The Politics of Institutional Change, , Harvard University Press; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 124. , Banking in China, 2nd edition; Barberis, J., A Crack in the Great Wall – Too-Big-To-Fail Them: A Societal Perspective, p. 36; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 44. , Congressional Research Service; Cousin, V., (2011) Palgrave Macmillan Studies in Banking and Financial Institutions, p. 58; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 14. , Oxford University Press USA; Tsai, K.S., (2004) Back-Alley Banking: Private Entrepreneurs in China, , Cornell University Press; Avgouleas, E., (2012) Governance of Global Financial Markets: The Law, The Economics, The Politics, p. 106. , Cambridge University Press; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 144. , Oxford University Press USA; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 144. , Oxford University Press USA; Zhang, J., (2013) Inside China's Shadow Banking: The Next Subprime Crisis?, p. 91. , Enrich Professional Publishing; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 7. , Congressional Research Service; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 44. , Congressional Research Service; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 21. , Oxford University Press USA; Martin, M.F., (2012) China’s Banking System: Issues for Congress, p. 2. , Congressional Research Service; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 16. , Oxford University Press USA; Hsu, S., Li, J., Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives Oxford The Post-American World; Hsu, S., Li, J., (2009) Informal Finance in China: American and Chinese Perspectives, p. 35. , (Oxford University Press USA, 2009), 133.University Press USA; Zhang, Z., (2015) Overcoming Challenges of Internet Finance Innovation in Hong Kong, , May, HKIFA; Zakaria, F., The Post-American World, p. 34. , Release 2.0 (W.

Every year, these requirements are increasing and it has become a challenge for financial institutions to meet the requirements manually, due to the high cost and increasing number of complex compliance requirements. These compliance challenges created the market for RegTech, which is a part of FinTech industry, where the RegTech industry promise to act as a solution to reduce compliance cost and burden for financial institutions as well as regulators. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic literature review conducted, on applying RegTech to reduce compliance cost and burden, while focusing on promising RegTech tools and various benefits and challenges of RegTech. The area of RegTech is very recent, which results in a gap in literature and research for the purpose of this review.

The inflow of money from criminal activities has a destructive impact on the state and the society, poses a threat to the economy and the social sphere. This negative process results in the disruption of market economy mechanisms, the criminalization of the production and trade sectors, the emergence of financial imbalances and the increase in the inflation pressure. The problem is urgent for Russia as well, so the development of effective solutions, including legal ones, is one of the priorities for researchers. In the mod ern context, the digitization of economy creates new opportunities for criminal groups, who use virtual technologies, crypto-currencies and other opportunities of the digital environment to finance terrorism and legalize criminal proceeds. The article presents the results of studying the condition and dynamics of legal regulation in the sphere of CML / FT. They include the qualitative description of the legal basis for CML / FT in Russia, doctrinal conclusions regarding the structure and key features of the Russian model of legal regulation of CML / FT, modern trends and the direction of its future development, predictions regarding the legal basis for CML / FT, setting fundamental and practical goals of the legal doctrine to provide scientific support for CML / FT, as well as legal solutions developed by the author. Besides, the author outlines and supports specific directions of reforming the Russian legislation with the goal of brining it in accord with the challenges of the digitization of economy and the emergence of new types of crime. © 2018, Baikal National University of Economics and Law.

Nevertheless, the question of how exactly to become fully compliant by adhering to all necessary laws and regulations remains. This paper presents a human-centred, knowledge-driven approach to regulatory reporting. A given regulation is represented in a controlled natural language form including its metadata and bindings, with the assistance of subject matter experts. This representation of a semi-formal controlled natural language translates into a self-executable formal representation via a context-free grammar. A meta reasoner with the knowledge to execute the given self-executable formal representation while generating regulatory reports including explanations on derived results has been developed. Finally, the proposed approach has been implemented as a prototype and validated in the realm of financial regulation: Money Market Statistical Reporting Regulation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Banking; Compliance; Explainability; Finance; Human-centred; Knowledge systems; Reasoning; RegTech; Regulations; Rule-based systems","Context free grammars; Context free languages; Intelligent systems; Automated reasoning; Controlled natural language; Financial regulations; Formal representations; Laws and regulations; Level of automations; Statistical reporting; Subject matter experts; Laws and legislation",,,,"Al Haider, N., Solving financial regulatory compliance using software contracts (2019) the 22nd International Conference on Applications of Declarative Programming and Knowledge Management, , Presented at; Araszkiewicz, M., Analogy, similarity and factors (2011) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law-ICAIL 2011, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pp. 101-105. , ACM Press; Arner, D.W., FinTech, RegTech and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2016) Northwest.

This tendency can be seen in numerous emerging regulations imposing a riskbased approach for IS security on entire economic sectors. However, a major drawback of the methods currently used is that risks are assessed individually by each organization for its own activities, and that no link is established between the risk management results of interacting organizations. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with systemic risks, i.e. risks propagated from one organization to another due to dependencies between them. This approach is an extension of an existing framework used from 2015 by a European national regulator in the telecommunications sector. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The fundamental purpose of the regulatory sandbox is to facilitate the development of fintech, especially the ‘disruptive innovation’ activities of the start-up enterprises. In this sense, the regulatory sandbox is a sub-category of the regulation of fintech. Fintech is technology-enabled financial innovation, synonymous with the term ‘internet finance’ in the Chinese context. A different but related term, the regulatory technology (regtech), in a broad sense refers to a combination of the ‘compliance technology’ by the market players with the ‘regulatory technology’ by the regulators. In nature, the regulatory sandbox is conditional, limited, and controlled deregulation. It was primarily a reaction to the somehow overly burdensome regulatory requirements after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), thus leaving a ‘lifeline’ for financial innovation and, in particular, fintech. The situation is very different in China, where the major problem for internet finance it not over-regulation but under-regulation. With a vast territory, diversified areas, and numerous institutions, China does not feature a much developed and high concentrated financial market like that of the UK, Singapore, or the HK SAR. Nor does it have an integrated financial regulatory system. And, most importantly, the existing mechanisms in China are capable of performing equivalent or even more functions than the sandbox, which, if copied in China, would be redundant. In short, the regulatory sandbox is admittedly a remarkable innovation in terms of regulatory ideas and approaches conducive to financial innovation, especially fintech. However, with its specific background, exterior conditions, and intrinsic limitations, it is by no means an inevitable choice or universal model for the regulation of fintech. Based on the actual circumstances, it’s not desirable for China to introduce the sandbox, at least for the time being. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Adaptive regulation; Disruptive innovation; Financial technology (fintech); Regulatory sandbox; Regulatory technology (regtech)",,,,,"Arner, D, The evolution of fintech: anew post-crisis paradigm (2016) Georgetown Journal of International Law, 47, pp. 1345-1393; Arner, D, Fintech, regtech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, pp. 383-384; (2017) Sound practices: implications of fintech development for banks and bank supervisors, , https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d415.pdf, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Accessed 31 March 2020; Baxter, L, Adaptive regulation in the amoral bazaar (2011) South African Law Journal, 128, pp. 253-272; Beyoud, L, (2018) Treasury report endorses fintech bank charters, sandboxes, , https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/treasury-report-endorses-fintech-bank-charters-sandboxes-1, Accessed 31 March 2020; Brummer, C, Disruptive technology and securities regulation (2015) Fordham Law Review, 84, pp. 977-1052; (2016) Policy on no-action letters, , https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201602_cfpb_no-action-letter-policy.pdf, CFPB Accessed 31 March 2020; (2016) Feedback statement, call for input on supporting the development and adopters of regtech, , https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/feedback/fs-16-04.pdf, FCA Accessed 31 March 2020; (2017) Regulatory sandbox lessons learned report, , https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/research-and-data/regulatory-sandbox-lessons-learned-report.pdf, FCA Accessed 31 March 2020; Regulatory sandbox, , https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/documents/regulatory-sandbox, FCA (2019a) Accessed 31 March 2020; Regulatory sandbox-cohort 1, regulatory sandbox-cohort 2, regulatory sandbox-cohort 3, regulatory sandbox-cohort 4, regulatory sandbox-cohort 5, , https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/regulatory-sandbox, FCA (2019b) Accessed 31 March 2020; (2017) Financial stability implications from fintech: supervisory and regulatory issues that merit authorities’ attention, , http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/R270617.pdf, FSB Accessed 31 March 2020; (2015) Fintech futures: the UK as a world leader in financial technologies, , https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/413095/gs-15-3-fintech-futures.pdf, Government Office for Science Accessed 31 March 2020; (2016) Research on disruptive innovation of Internet industry, , Guo Unpublished Doctoral Dissertation, University of Science and Technology of China (in Chinese); Li, (2018) In depth promotion of special rectification of Internet financial risks [Hulianwang jinrong fengxian zhuanxiang zhengzhi shenru tuijin], , Financial Times; Lin, Data logic, technology application and development path of regtech [Jianguan keji de shuju luoji, jishu yingyong ji fazhan lujing] (2017) South China Finance, 10, pp. 44-50; McCray, L, Planned adaptation in risk regulation: an initial survey of US environmental, health, and safety regulation (2010) Technol Forecast Soc Chang, 77, pp. 951-959; (2015) Guidance on promoting the healthy development of Internet finance [Guanyu cujin hulianwang jinrong jiankang fazhan de zhidao yijian], , http://www.cbrc.gov.cn/showFfjzDoc/E02EFF7A63564F8B9DF4ED2B3A736310.html, People’s Bank of China et al.

The adoption of a shared data architecture, whereby the regulator is provided with seamless access to the accounts of regulated firms, may result in the development of a centralized approach to regulatory modelling, thus bypassing the existing partition between internal models and standardized approaches. Secondly, this article discusses how, thanks to the adoption of advanced predictive analytics, non-bank fintech lenders can gain insights into borrowers' creditworthiness irrespective of banks' control over traditional sources of information for credit scoring. This, though, may give rise to a new type of strategic gaming, this time by borrowers keen to maximize their chances of being granted a loan. In any case, preventing banks from adopting these new methods for the purpose of regulatory modelling might weaken their competitiveness. Thirdly, this article explores whether the transition to a centralized approach for credit risk management would conflate the distinction between microprudential and macroprudential interventions, in particular with respect to the countercyclical macroprudential policy. Finally, the article argues that non-bank (fintech) firms could be persuaded to coalesce behind endorsement of the new regulatory shared data platform in return for the support from the central bank. In this way, the regulatory perimeter could be extended in order to steer the adoption of financial innovations in a manner that benefits society overall. © The Author(s) 2019.

Services computing researchers will play an important role in advancing Regtech, but they must add to their repertoire additional knowledge of financial principles, an understanding of common Fintech pathologies that may be exploited by bad actors, and new thinking in regard to protecting customer data across multiple legal jurisdictions and the related compliance of boundary crossing banking-related algorithms. This paper uses supply chain finance as a use case to demonstrate details of this needed new repertoire. Ten areas of goal and constraint resetting relevant to Regtech software development and traditional services computing approaches are discussed. At stake is the need for services computing scholars to engage in developing some of the most critical software services of our age - those that can help to maintain and advance our market-based societies. © 2019 IEEE.","Fintech; Regtech; Supply Chain Finance","Commerce; Contracts; Finance; Regulatory compliance; Supply chains; Additional knowledge; Financial principles; Fintech; Regtech; Related algorithms; Supply chain finances; Traditional services; Transparent process; Software design",,,,"(2018) Regtech to Account for 40% of Global Compliance Spend by 2023, Rising Sixfold to %115 Billion, , https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/regtechto-account-for-40-per-cent-of-global5/1/2019, Juniper Research '; Mooney, C.W., Fintech and secured transactions systems of the future (2018) Law and Contemporary Problems, pp. 1-20; Tsai, C.H., Peng, K.J., The fintech revolution and financial regulation: The case of online supply-chain financing (2017) Asian Journal of Law and Society, 4, pp. 109-131; Regtech for regulators: Rearchitecting the system for better regulation (2018) World Government Summit, pp. 1-33; Zetzsche, D., Arner, D.W., Buckley, R.P., Weber, R.H., The future of data-driven finance and Regtech: Lessons from EU Big Bang II (2019) EBI Working Paper Series, pp. 1-51; Moretto, A., Grassi, L., Caniato, F., Giorgino, M., Ronchi, S., Supply chain finance; from traditional supply chain to supply chain credit rating (2019) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, pp. 197-217; Kilu, E., Milani, F., Scott, E., Pfahl, D., Agile software process improvement by learning rom financial and Fintech companies: LHV bank case study (2019) Software Quality: The Complexity and Challenges of Software Engineering and Software Quality in the Cloud, pp. 57-69. , D.

The concept of making a compliance blueprint will be explained, which, if integrated in the design of a product, is the cornerstone of releasing a reliable product that is trusted by both care providers and patients. Compliance blueprints increasingly are supported by regulatory technology (RegTech).

These include a wide array of tools to mitigate risks arising from the distinct risk factors that are further consolidated under the risk strategy of a specific enterprise. Any firm in space industry and outside of it faces risks that can be associated with the following key areas: strategic, reputational, regulatory, financial, operational, and cyber. Integrating high tech solutions into the risk mitigation process has now become available by implementing solutions based on artificial intelligence technology. Recent advances in risk management are numerous and include regulatory technology (RegTech) and financial technology (FinTech) solutions that are necessary in the competitive environment. Conservative risk mitigation methods are not fast paced enough to conduct numerous iterations in a split second timeframe and tackle arising risks. For instance, the new regulatory framework design for the company will be more efficient if it grounds on the RegTech concept. The latter automates the state-of-the-art risk mitigation methods and allows for integrating human expertise and newest technology.

This would suggest that the new types of (traditional) banking services and the new type of (traditional) banking service providers have emerged in the market. The paper describes the commercial banking services, the set-up commercial banks operate in and the changes occurring in the market triggered by financial technology (the FinTech firms). When researching the effects of financial technology, the paper focuses on the trends in the market and the efficiencies the new services are responsible for. The new service providers have shown that they are meeting the demands of the consumers/clients that banks have not, such as crowdfunding, or battling financial inclusion. The grand issue surrounding the FinTech sector is the lack of applicable regulatory environment. Challenges the regulators are faced with when designing the regulation applicable to the financial technology are the speed the services are evolving with and choosing the right moment to place regulation. The lack of adequate regulation leaves customers/clients unprotected. Nevertheless, the FinTech sector is growing rapidly. Indications in the market suggest the FinTech firms are leading the way the commercial banking sector will follow. © 2019 University of Zagreb Faculty of Economics and Business.

Today, finance is not only the world's most globalized segment, but also among the most digitized. This process is evident across four major areas: the emergence of global wholesale markets, a spike in financial technology startups since 2008, an unprecedented digital transformation in the financial sector of developing countries (especially in China), and the growing role played in financial services by large technology firms (TechFin) as well as increasing real-time interconnections. The Digital Financial Process Transformation carries with it systemic changes. This improvement has optimistic, but also detrimental, consequences in the form of new threats. Although finance and technology have always collaborated and assisted each other, there have been extraordinary changes over the time after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, especially in terms of the pace of change and the scale of new entrants. Pace of transition can be seen in particular in the position of emerging technology, also summarized as the ABCD framework: artificial intelligence (""AI""), blockchain, cloud and technology, which are rapidly co-evolving with finance. Many would add mobile Internet and Internet of Things (""IoT"") to this framework as well (Buckley, 2019).

A financial service regulation has inflated at an astounding rate since the financial crisis and, therefore, has the price tag of regulatory compliance. Many start-ups have begun to apply digital technological knowledge including APIs, AI, RPAs, and many more to these immediate, numerous, and burdensome tasks to meet the terms and regulations, hence the emergence of RegTech. This study examines the implications for financial institutions and regulation particularly when technology poses a confront to the global banking and regulatory system. It attempts to examine the characteristics and applications of RegTech in the world of regulatory compliance. It also illustrates a model to define the transformation of present workload to proposed workload of regulatory compliance with an application of RegTech. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Further, theoretical support for the role of internal corporate whistleblowers can be found in the smart regulation paradigm, which points to the potential for whistleblowers to operate as surrogate regulators. In light of this, the potential impact of fast-developing ‘RegTech’ applications on corporate whistleblowing activity has significant regulatory implications. While ‘first’ generation RegTech applications such as improved data analytics already have the capability to assist corporations to implement more efficient internal whistleblowing systems, the rise of second-generation AI-powered RegTech technologies is likely to further disrupt, and potentially transform, the practice of whistleblowing in corporations. As AI advances, internal corporate whistleblowers may be supplemented, or even replaced, by ‘whistlebots’ with the ability to report autonomously, with dramatic implications for the role of whistleblowing as a corporate regulatory device. © 2020, University of New South Wales Law Journal.

However, the application of technological solutions to reduce compliance costs in supervising financial activities can interfere with the intervention of regulators. The extent to which compliance with the regulation can be automated by technologies raises the question whether the manual intervention is still required.

The concept of Regulatory Technology, or RegTech, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is still in the infant stage due to lack of defined processes and it holds immense potential in employing RegTech to its existing institutions. The purpose of this paper is to understand the various factors that determine the adoption for RegTech services and proposes a multi-criteria decision-making approach by ranking those determinants. The determinants are divided into three main hierarchies which include customers, regulators, and environment-based factors. Survey was conducted to rank each of the determinants within the hierarchy to validate the need for RegTech services. It is observed that customer-centric experience, enhancing data security and ensuring real-time data capabilities play the major factors for the implementation of RegTech services that is validated by constructing an AHP model. The need for RegTech's determinants would help financial institutions, regulators, and stakeholders in the UAE benefit from the research and achieve competitive advantage by understanding and implementing the suggested findings.

We would like to examine the experiences of technology integration applied to the regulation of the markets and to the compliace, in the banking sector in Italy. Our paper responds to a gap in literature that on the subject of regtech is mainly based on legal, defining arguments and about reviewing the literature on the macro context and the issues generated by the huge amount of regulation. The article will explore three cases of RegTech companies in Italy presenting advantages and criticalities in the adoption of regtech solutions on the Italian market. Methods/Approach: Today the literature about case study in RegTech is not proposing any solution of cooperation on the regulatory field in Italy. So we have to fill the gap we find in exploration of literature. An analysis in the field cannot be separated from a preliminary systematic review of the literature on regulatory case studies. We begin our scientific analysis of the subject through a preliminary literature review individuating any case study around RegTech through exploratory case study. Due to the scarcity of papers about case study in RegTech field, we adopt an approach already used for well-studied cases widespread in the FinTech area and an exploratory investigation through in deep interviews following models used in FinTech area and in ERM field. Results/Findings: In this article, we will, therefore, propose case studies in the FinTech sector applied to regulatory technology in Italy and we expect to answer the following research questions: We present three RegTech's cases in Italy's financial system exposing the fields of collaboration with financial institutions in RegTech field between incumbents and RegTech industries. We expose also how big I.T. companies, which are providing services for banks, are refocusing and improving compliance through RegTech to provide services linked to compliance, Kyc, Aml, privacy, payments to the incumbents. In conclusion we express topics interested by cooperation between banks and RegTech companies describing the potetial expansion lines. Implications: Understand how financial companies through regulatory technology can: Improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. Improve prudential compliance, anti money laundering and customer protection. Reduce the risks of traditional banking business through better knowledge and customer identification and profiling may also offer more favourable terms to companies and lowering compliance costs to shift economic resources towards FinTech's disruptive innovation. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Blockchains introduce analog scarcity into digital abundance. Beyond the sucess of Bitcoins as digital currency, they promise new options to organize institutions, to manage public ledgers and to setup and complete deals with so-called «smart contracts». At the end of the day, the «blocks» are simply digital objects in an IT system and many established legal concepts can be applied problem-free. However, to create valid legal effects blockchains should be anchored prudently in the surrounding legal context and specific regulations will be supportive to unfold their potential in a sustainable way and in an international context. © 2018 Editions Weblaw.

(Semi-)automation of compliance processes requires a machine-readable version of legal requirements in a format that enables effective compliance assessment. The use of a semi-structured controlled natural language as an intermediate step of the translation from a human-readable text to a machine-readable and understandable format ensures that the process of interpretation of those requirements is as simple as possible. However, it does not ensure that the formal representation resulting from the interpretation faithfully represents the intended semantics provided by the legal expert. Visualization techniques such as property graphs in Neo4j could fill this gap, allowing legal experts to understand and control the formal representation of the result of their act of interpretation. © 2017 CEUR-WS.
