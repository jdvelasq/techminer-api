For lending-based crowdfunding, lenders prefer projects of borrowers that are culturally similar and geographically proximate (Burtch et al. , ). Furthermore, the authors discover that the negative effect of cultural differences on pledging activities of lenders is decreasing for higher distances. Paravisini et al. () identified that investors show different risk aversion in their decision behavior. Although counter-intuitive, their analysis reveals that wealthier investors have a higher risk aversion and, more intuitive, that investors in crowdfunding behave in a more risk averse manner after negative wealth shocks.","The authors of these papers have discovered interesting factors that support the successful collecting of money. Zvilichovsky et al. () concentrated on reciprocity in crowdfunding. They found that having helped other founders on the platform by pledging money has a positive effect on successful funding and provided evidence for direct and indirect reciprocity. Mollick () suggested that personal networks and project quality are factors that support funding success. Colombo et al. () supported that backing others (“internal social capital”) is important for funding success. They explained that this effect “is fully mediated by the capital and backers collected in the campaign’s early days”. Koch and Siering () analyzed the influence of project- and founder-specific aspects on funding success and concluded that the use of media (like texts, pictures, and videos) is an important factor supporting success. They also captured the idea of reciprocity and supported its positive influence on funding results. For equity-based crowdfunding, Ahlers et al. () argued that keeping a part of the equity instead of selling the entirety of equity has a positive influence on funding success as this is interpreted as a quality signal and proposed that detailed information about risk and the internal governance (e.g., board structure) also influence funding success.",,,,,,,,,"Gomber, P.; Chair of e-Finance, Theodor-W.-Adorno-Platz 4, Germany; email: gomber@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de","Springer Berlin Heidelberg",00442372,,,,"English","J.

These new players and instruments have emerged, among others, because of the difficulties faced by entrepreneurs and early-stage new ventures in raising funds, especially in the wake of the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Other reasons comprise increased technological opportunities, changed requirements in firms’ product markets, globalization, and regulatory changes. Moreover, the difficulties firms encounter in raising seed and start-up capital play an increasingly important role in the policy agenda of local, national, and international governmental institutions, as is documented by the measures included in the Horizon 2020 and COSME projects funded by the European Commission.","The last two papers in this special issue deal with debt. Mietzner et al. (2017) is one of very few studies on mini-bonds. Using a German dataset in the period from 2010 to 2015, they show that rating agencies can create rating inflation by issuing overly favorable ratings. This creates an opportunity for lower-quality firms to compete for funding. In this environment, high-quality firms have an incentive to use mini-bond underpricing to signal their quality. Martí and Quas (2017) prove the effectiveness of a recent form of government support in Spain, called participative loan, in improving recipient SMEs’ access to external financial debt. The positive effect of this program is stronger for smaller firms, or for those operating in high-technology sectors, which suffer more acutely from information asymmetries, and negligible for firms that already received support from other government-supported institutions.",,,,,,,,,"Block, J.H.; University of TrierGermany; email: block@uni-trier.de","Springer New York LLC",0921898X,,,,"English","Small Bus.

These are usually the ‘first movers’ and they are strongly financed by established financial markets and supported by advanced technology-platforms for scaling. For smaller markets, the small and medium-sized companies potentially face the future scaling and funding problem. Such companies may already be partially successful in their respective markets but further expansion financing for growth and internationalisation can come across the ‘bottleneck’ consequence. Much of the decline in the number of ‘smaller’ companies becoming listed is attributed to the very difficulty of being a small public company; this is reflected in the actions of venture capitalists, who once sought public listings when they wanted to exit their investments and now overwhelmingly choose private sales (Ritter, Economist, 2018 ). There is thus the real potential that firms are going to seek strategic alliances with incumbent financial institutions within the sector as their survival strategy. The risk for promising fintech/start-up companies is that there is also the potential to be constricted under the pressure of having to meet invariable demands in the services and products they offer. As such the issue becomes one of scale and capacity against larger firms, possibly the incumbents or indeed technology giants (i.e. Amazon, Apple etc.). This is important as at this stage. This is an industry with no ‘made’, crisis-resistant, proven businesses thus far. We do not know yet whether start-ups are mentally prepared for ‘exchanges’ in order to finance growth. In an industry under exponential development, pure cash exits do not exist as well for venture capital nor do acquisition evaluation models of a ‘made’ fintech business exist. Established institutions have the scale to absorb this which potentially gives rise to growth through a mergers and acquisitions wave. A pragmatic way for mergers to go through at this point is via exchanges of shares. The dangers in such a scenario are the ‘old-new firms’ where they ‘grow-and-consume’ entrants.",,,,,,,,,,,"Elsevier Inc.",01486195,,JEBUD,,"English","J. Econ.

The business license in the first step and the business permit in the third step are general in nature and thus are not very difficult to get. The recordation and registration requirement in the second step is specific to the online lending business.

McCarthy wanted to see if “intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.” “When I suggested to Claude Shannon in 1952 that we collect studies relevant to machines thinking, he agreed but wanted the title to be nonflashy, so we chose ‘Automata Studies.’ When the articles came in, too few of them were relevant to making machines think,” McCarthy says. “Therefore, when it was time to propose the Dartmouth project—the proposal was written in August 1955— I wanted to nail the flag to the mast so that the participants would be fully aware of the goal of the work.” McCarthy adds, “I think ‘machine intelligence’ also came to mind.” The group proposed to study the relationship of language to intelligence during the two-month, 10-person project, “to play games well and do other tasks.” McCarthy was only a part-time AI activist then. “Mathematics and other computer science took up most of my time,” he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,15411672,,,,"English","IEEE Intell.

Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (eg financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are becoming increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation: see inter alia DW Arner, JN Barberis and RP Buckley, ‘FinTech, RegTech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation’ (2016) University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law Research Paper No 2016/035 5https://ssrn.com/ abstract¼2847806>accessed 22 June 2017; JA Maupin, ‘Mapping the Global Legal Landscape of Blockchain Technologies’ (2017) 5https://ssrn.com/abstract¼2930077> accessed 22 June 2017. 15 G Barbiroli, The Dynamics of Technology: A Methodological Framework for Techno-Economic Analyses (Kluwer Academic 1997) 58. 16 See, in general, E Avgouleas, ‘International Credit Markets: Players, Financing Techniques, Instruments and Regulation’ in H Bigdoli (ed), The Handbook of Technology Management (Wiley & Sons 2009) 675–92. 17 AWA Boot and AV Thakor, ‘Commercial Banking and Shadow Banking.

And on the other hand – highly intellectual human capital, adoption and support of global trends in the digitalization of financial intermediation, development of small and medium-sized businesses (funding of almost 45% of FinTech startups is made at the expense of own resources, but the need for investments is estimated at $ 40-70 million), legislative liberalization and regulator support (the NBU initiatives “Comprehensive Program of Ukraine Financial Sector Development Until 2020”, “Promotion of FinTech in Ukraine”, “BankID”, “MobileID”, etc.). In particular, the implementation of the EU directive of payment systems PSD2 provides support for payments security, protection of financial data and consumer rights, compliance with the uniform requirements and rules, transparent conditions for their functioning.

Likewise, M-Kopa experimented with adding instruments that measure other weather-related metrics such as barometric pressure, humidity, temperature and rainfall. With this, the company proved that its solar units could be turned into mini weather stations which can collect and relay weather-and climate-related data at a significantly lower cost than conventional weather stations.

El gobierno del entonces presidente Georg W. Bush reaccionó con la creación de la Corporate Fraud Task Force, mientras que el Congreso de los Estados Unidos por su parte dictó la SOA, la cual establece deberes de vigilancia y sistemas de compliance más estrictos para las corporaciones.38","Por otra parte, las USFSG son un conjunto de normas dictadas por la United States Sentencing Commission que tienen por objeto uniformar a nivel federal los criterios de determinación de las penas y medidas de seguridad.40 El capítulo 8 establece normas para la determinación de las penas y medidas de seguridad aplicables a organizaciones, las cuales pueden consistir en la reparación del daño causado por la conducta criminal (“remedying harm from criminal conduct”, §8B USFSG), la multa penal (“fines”, §8C USFSG) y la condena condicional (“organizational probation”, §8D USFSG).","La UKBA no define lo que debe entenderse bajo el concepto de “procedimientos adecuados”, razón por la cual el Reino Unido publicó en marzo del año 2011 una Guía confeccionada por el Ministerio de Justicia del Reino Unido, explicando el sentido y alcance de ciertas disposiciones, todo ello en conformidad con la sección 9 UKBA.46En este documento se establece que los “procedimientos adecuados” a implementar por parte de la organización deben reflejar seis principios: los procedimientos deben ser proporcionales al riesgo de cohecho que enfrenta la organización y a la naturaleza, escala y complejidad de sus actividades (proporcionate procedures); los directivos principales deben comprometerse con las tareas de prevención de cohecho de las personas asociadas a la organización (top-level commitment); un análisis del riesgo de cohecho al que se está expuesto que sea periódico, informado y documentado (risk assessment); una selección y examen proporcionado y basado en el riesgo de las relaciones comerciales (due diligence); el aseguramiento de que las políticas y procedimientos de prevención del delito de cohecho han sido difundidos y comprendidos al interior de la organización (communication – including training); y un constante monitoreo, evaluación y revisión de los procedimientos de prevención de cohecho (monitoring and review).47","Existen mecanismos a través de los cuales puede subsanarse esta falencia. En el contexto de la UKBA, la guía elaborada por el Ministerio de Justicia británico sobre los “procedimientos adecuados” constituye una herramienta de precisión que está ausente en nuestro ordenamiento jurídico. La labor de la BaFin en Alemania de concretizar a través de su normativa los deberes de los sujetos obligados en materia de prevención de lavado de activos, es también valiosa para dar forma al contenido de los deberes de organización al interior de las instituciones financieras. Y sin ir más lejos, los deberes de criminal compliance impuestos a través de las circulares de la UAF, SBIF y SVS en relación con la prevención del lavado de activos en nuestro país, constituyen también una útil herramienta para determinar si los sujetos obligados cumplen con sus deberes de organización internos y, por lo tanto, si son liberados o no de responsabilidad, en caso de que se cometa un delito.",,,,,,,"Scholz, F.J.B.; Universidad Autónoma de ChileChile; email: francisco.bedecarratz@uautonoma.cl","Centro Estudios Derecho Penal",07183399,,,,"Spanish","Polit.

CRONBACH'S ""MY CURRENT THOUGHTS ON COEFFICIENT ALPHA AND SUCCESSOR PROCEDURES"" LEE J. CRONBACH 1916-2001 ""My Current Thoughts on Coefficient Alpha and Successor Procedures"" grew out of a meeting Lee and I had at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in June 2001. After their lunch, Nate Gage had dropped Lee off at the Center (where I was spending a Sabbatical year) so we could catch up on recent events. Lee looked exhausted, listless, and despondent. I knew he was battling a disease that severely limited his eyesight, but I didn't expect to see this. Per- haps his eyesight was taking a greater toll than I had imagined. I also knew that he had just completed a major project that his close friend and colleague, Richard E. Snow, had begun and couldn't complete because of his untimely death in December 1997. As dean of the Stanford University School of Education, I had encouraged Lee to take on the project and pro- vided research assistant support in the person of Min Li, now an assistant professor at the University of Washington. For a good 3 years, Lee had led a team of scholars--Lyn Corno, Haggai Kupermintz, David F. Lohman, Ellen B. Mandinach, Ann W. Porteus, and Joan E. Talbert, all of The Stan- ford Aptitude Seminar--in completing Remaking the Concept of Aptitude: Extending the Legacy of R. E. Snow. Perhaps Lee simply reflected the let- down that often comes upon completing a major project. Finally, I knew that to honor his commitment to Dick Snow, Lee had put a very important project on the back burner. He was quite aware at the time he took on the Snow project that the 50th anniversary of his ""alpha paper"" was Editor's Note: The work reported herein was supported in part by the National Center on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST) under the Educational Research and De- velopment Center Program, PR/Award Number R305B60002, as administered by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education. The findings and opin- ions expressed in this report do not reflect the positions or policies of the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, the U.S. Department of Education. I am indebted to my colleagues Ed Haertel and Bob Brennan for helping to check for accuracy. Nevertheless, I alone am respon- sible for errors of commission and omission.

Before Dick's death, he had planned on writing a major technical article for Psychometrika on his current views at this golden anni- versary. The Snow project had intervened, and it looked as if this alpha article wasn't going to get done. In the end, all three events probably contributed to his demeanor at our meeting at the Center in June 2001. It would be 2 months later that I would learn the major reason for his appearance: Lee had decided in February of that year not to take medication to retard his congestive heart failure; he died on October 3, 2001. Fortunately, being in my usual state of ignorance in June and knowing how excited Lee could get at the thought of a new project, I didn't hesitate to give unsolicited advice based on my then current ""diagnosis."" I asked Lee to reconsider doing an article to celebrate the 50th anniversary of coefficient alpha. I tried to persuade him that the world didn't need another esoteric tech- nical article when what was important were his nontechnical ideas about alpha now. I went on to say, in response to his demure due to poor eyesight, that he could dictate his thoughts and we could have them transcribed. I believe the idea of a new project lifted his spirits. As I drove him home, he allowed as how he'd give the new project some thought, but that I shouldn't be too optimistic. A day or two later, he called. He was excited, spirits lifted: he'd do the project . . . if I would agree to help edit the manuscript. We had a deal,and theresultisbefore your eyes inthearticlethatfollows thispreface. Just before he died, we were together in his apartment. Lee, lying in his bed, looked at me, smiled that Cronbach smile, and said something like, ""Turn about is fair play."" He was referring to my encouraging him to take up the book for Dick Snow. Now it was my turn to put together his monograph. He smiled again and said, ""I thank you and my ghost thanks you."" He died eight hours later. What we have in ""My Current Thoughts"" is vintage Cronbach. I followed his admonition not to editthe articleheavily but to make sure the ideas flowed and especially that there were no technical gaffes. He was right once again about editing. When I read the article now, I hear Lee speaking and I can see him speaking to me. In the end, his dictating not only preserved his ""current"" ideas about alpha 50 years after its publication--it also preserved the way he reasoned and talked about his ideas. I hope you enjoy reading the piece as much as I have enjoyed editing it. --Richard J.
