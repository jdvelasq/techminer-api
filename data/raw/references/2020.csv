Documents that only refer to a national context—such as for instance position papers of national interest groups (Smart Dubai Smart Dubai ), the report of the British House of Lords (Bakewell et al. ), or the Nordic engineers’ stand on Artificial Intelligence and Ethics (Podgaiska and Shklovski)—were excluded from the compilation. Nevertheless, I included the European Commission’s “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI” (Pekka et al. ), the Obama administration’s “Report on the Future of Artificial Intelligence” (Holdren et al. ), and the “Beijing AI Principles” (Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence ), which are backed by the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology. I have included these three guidelines because they represent the three largest AI “superpowers”. Furthermore, I included the “OECD Principles on AI” (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ) due to their supranational character. Scientific papers or texts that fall into the category of AI ethics but focus on one or more specific aspects of the topic were not considered either. The same applies to guidelines or toolkits, which are not specifically about AI but rather about big data, algorithms or robotics (Anderson et al. ; Anderson and Anderson ). I further excluded corporate policies, with the exception of the “Information Technology Industry AI Policy Principles” (), the principles of the “Partnership on AI” (), the IEEE first and second version of the document on “Ethically Aligned Design” (The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems , ), as well as the brief principle lists of Google (), Microsoft (), DeepMind (DeepMind), OpenAI (), and IBM (Cutler et al. ) which have become well-known through media coverage. Other large companies such as Facebook or Twitter have not yet published any systematic AI guidelines, but only isolated statements of good conduct. Paula Boddington’s book on ethical guidelines () funded by the Future of Life Institute was also not considered as it merely repeats the Asilomar principles ().",,,,,,,,,,"Hagendorff, T.; Cluster of Excellence “Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science”, Germany; email: thilo.hagendorff@uni-tuebingen.de","Springer",09246495,,MMACE,,"English","Minds Mach",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078946650

In the last 15 years, commercial banks have witnessed a downturn in their performance. Traditional financial market needs FinTech to provide new profit, increase regulatory efficiency and meet customers’ demands. Gradually, various kinds of innovative FinTech business models appear in financial market. Researches on FinTech business model have drawn widespread attention among academics. Lee and Teo (2015) defined FinTech in five principles: low profit margin, light asset, expandability, innovation and easy compliance. The US Financial Stability Board (FSB, 2017) defined FinTech as financial technological innovation resulting in new business models, applications, processes or products. It had a considerable effect on financial markets, institutions and services. Leong et al. (2017) did case study on the business model of 007fendi. Gomber et al. (2017) did a literature review about FinTech and analyzed future research direction. They thought the future Fintech are cross-country and cross-regional peer-to-peer transfer systems, the smart-phone in financial transactions and wearable facilities for financial transaction are the future FinTech. Eickhoff et al. (2017) developed a taxonomy of FinTech business models. Haddad and Lars (2018) thought Fintech occurred more frequently in well-developed economies countries or more fragile financial sectors. FinTech business model is the specific application of FinTech in the economic and financial fields. For example, e-banking integrates internet technology, APP and mobile payment. It enables users to complete bank account transaction at home, which improves the efficiency of bank transactions and saves customers’ time. From the perspective of business model, we can have a more specific understanding of FinTech. We will be clearer about its application and its significance of existence.This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71722007 & 71931001), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (XK1802-5 & buctrc201926).","This work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71722007 & 71931001 ), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities ( XK1802-5 & buctrc201926 ).",,,,,,,,,"Wang, S.; Beijing University of Chemical TechnologyChina","Elsevier Inc.",00401625,,,,"English","Technol.
