2022-0003,1,"while financial technology has brought new directions to china's finance, it is also accompanied by regulatory problems"
2022-0003,2,traditional financial supervision concepts and models need to be reformed urgently
2022-0003,3,"in terms of supervision methods, it is also necessary to upgrade supervision technology accordingly, establish a big data supervision platform, give full play to the role of third-party credit service agencies on this basis, improve the technical knowledge of supervisors, and strengthen the work of network security to fill the regulatory loopholes"
2022-0004,0,the digitisation process is affecting all markets and raising consumer awareness about companies sustainable behaviour
2022-0004,1,this work studies the effect of the sustainability profile of fintech companies on the firm (market value and book value) as the factors that add value to investors and motivate their evolution in markets are still unknown
2022-0004,2,"using the kbw and nasdaq fintech indices, and the nasdaq insurance index (ixis), we composed a panel of 95 companies over a 10-year period (20102019) with economic-financial variables and data about green certificates and sustainability indices"
2022-0004,3,the applied methodology is based on dynamic (gmm-sys) and static (pcse) panel data models
2022-0004,4,"our results show that the market value of fintech companies is positively driven by an csr report being issued, the position in the csr reptrak, company size and board size"
2022-0004,5,"in contrast, the number of green certificates, particularly their position in the green ranking, is negatively related to their market value"
2022-0004,6,"surprisingly in the most transparent companies, the direction of the variables effect evidenced for the book value per share is the opposite to market capitalisation"
2022-0005,0,"in the recent years, the concerns raised by environmentalists, over the excessive usage of electricity, particularly in the mining of cryptocurrencies, have caught the attention of the community at large"
2022-0005,1,"in this regard, regulators and stakeholders have been reevaluating the costs and benefits of technological development in general, as well as in fintech, specifically targeting their efforts towards the restoration of the environment"
2022-0005,2,"considering that technology has long been perceived as dual edged sword for the environment, this would be the appropriate time to assess its true role in the environmental improvement, or rather, even deterioration"
2022-0005,3,"therefore, this study attempts to address the question of whether the fintech development is helping economies towards a smooth transition towards a lower level of carbon and greenhouse gasses emissions"
2022-0005,4,"our results in this aspect are highly encouraging, and confirm that fintech development can in fact help to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, after the inclusion of appropriate control variables"

2022-0000,6,our selection criteria is the market capitalisation and we choose the top twenty technology and the top twenty finance firms to evaluate tail risk and systemic risk
2022-0000,7,"we found that the tail risk of technology firms is higher than the financial firms, whereas they are less likely to be in distress conditional upon a shock from the system"
2022-0000,8,"however, this finding for technology firms reverses when we use recent data via our six-year rolling estimates"
2022-0000,9,"we conclude that, similar to finance firms, there should be tighter regulations for technology firms since technology firms are riskier than the finance firms"
2022-0000,10,our paper has significant implications for both national and global financial regulators
2022-0006,0,technology-based mobile applications merge the transportation market as public passenger transportation has to benefit from market coupons

2021-0086,2,"using a comprehensive sample of chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), we find that state-owned enterprises (soes) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek fintech finance"
2021-0086,3,"in the chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which soe smes can access cheaper conventional finance through soe banks"
2021-0086,4,the quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of fintech financing
2021-0086,5,"as for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by r&d activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of fintech finance for innovative high-growth firms"

2021-0067,2,the regression results show that the degree of prudence taken by the lending platform in the pre-screening activity negatively affects the detection of some misreporting borrowers
2021-0067,3,"i also find that the fintech platforms missing verification information (e.g., annual income and employment length) affects the rr of non-performing loans, thereby hampering lenders collection performance"
2021-0094,0,"in recent years, biometric technologies have been widely embedded in mobile devices"
2021-0094,1,these technologies were originally employed to enhance the security of mobile devices
2021-0094,2,"with the rise of financial technology (fintech), which uses mobile devices and applications as promotional platforms, biometrics has the important role of strengthening the identification of such applications for security"
2021-0094,3,"however, users still have privacy and trust concerns about biometrics"
2021-0094,4,previous studies have demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (tam) can rigorously explain and predict user acceptance of new technologies
2021-0094,5,this study therefore modifies the tam as a basic research architecture
2021-0094,6,"based on a literature review, we add two new variables, namely, perceived privacy and perceived trust, to extend the traditional tam to examine user acceptance of biometric identification in fintech applications"
2021-0094,7,"first, we apply the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to evaluate the defined objects and relevant criteria of the research framework"
2021-0094,8,"second, we use the ahp results in the scenario analysis to explore biometric identification methods that correspond to objects and criteria"
2021-0094,9,the results indicate that face and voice recognition are the two most preferred identification methods in fintech applications

2021-0099,4,fintech tools can be a crucial way to improve financial access and household resilience
2021-0100,0,telemarketing is a primary and mature method for enterprises to solicit prospective customers to buy products or services
2021-0100,1,"however, training telesales representatives is always a pain point for enterprises since it is usually conducted manually and costs great effort and time"
2021-0100,2,"in this demonstration, we propose a telemarketing coaching system named smartsales to help enterprises develop better salespeople"
2021-0100,3,"powered by artificial intelligence (ai), smartsales aims to accumulate the experienced sales pitch from customer-sales dialogues and use it to coach junior salespersons"
2021-0100,4,"to the best of our knowledge, this is the first practice of an ai telemarketing coaching system in the domain of chinese fintech in the literature"
2021-0100,5,smartsales has been successfully deployed in the webank's telemarketing team
2021-0100,6,we expect that smartsales will inspire more research on ai assistant systems
2021-0101,0,embedded devices enabling payments transaction processing in financial services industry cannot have any margin for error
2021-0101,1,these devices need to be tested validated by replicating production like environment to the extent possible
2021-0101,2,"this means literally handling payments related events like swiping a credit card, tapping a mobile phone or pressing buttons amongst many other things like in real world"
2021-0101,3,"embedded software development is time consuming as it involves multiple man-machine interactions and dependencies such as managing and handling embedded devices, operating devices (push buttons, interpret display panels, read receipt printouts etc.) and sharing devices for collaboration within team"
2021-0101,4,"during the current pandemic, it was impossible for software teams to travel to office, share devices or even procure necessary devices on time for project related tasks"
2021-0101,5,this caused delay to project delivery and increased time to market
2021-0101,6,the paper describes how the team used capgemini's flexible robotics as a service (raas) platform that helped during pandemic to automate feasible man-machine interactions using robotic arms
2021-0101,7,"the paper provides details of the work done by the team that involves internet of things (iot), artificial intelligence (ai) to remotely handle and operate hardware and devices thereby completing embedded software development life cycles faster and well within budget while ensuring superior product quality and importantly ensuring team's health and safety"
2021-0101,8,this is novel in financial services space
2021-0102,0,"purpose: recently, the concept of financial technology (fintech) has attracted extensive attention from international organisations and regulators, in particular, how to achieve a winwin situation between financial institutions' fintech innovation and effective regulation has become a hot topic"
2021-0102,1,this study purposes to explore the evolutionary game relationship between fintech innovation and regulation by constructing both static and dynamic earmarking game models
2021-0102,2,design/methodology/approach: a simulation experiment was conducted using primary data obtained from a commercial bank in china
2021-0102,3,"findings: the results of the theoretical analysis of evolutionary game models were consistent with the corresponding simulation results, proving the validity of the proposed evolutionary game models"
2021-0102,4,it was also found that the dynamic earmarking game model was more stable and effective than the static earmarking game model in promoting fintech innovation and regulation
2021-0102,5,"furthermore, when the regulators utilised a dynamic earmarking mechanism, the evolutionary path of financial institutions and regulators' behaviour strategies took the shape of a spiral and eventually converged to a central point, indicating the existence of an evolutionary stable strategy and nash equilibrium"
2021-0102,6,"finally, because the behaviour strategies of financial institutions were mainly influenced by the regulators' policies, the regulators were inspired to adjust the corresponding regulation policies on fintech innovation"
2021-0102,7,"originality/value: this study bridges the knowledge gap in the existing literature on financial innovation and regulation, in particular by establishing evolutionary game models from the perspective of financial earmarking policies"
2021-0102,8,"also, the case study for simulation experiments can gain a more intuitive insight into fintech innovation and financial earmarking policies"
2021-0103,0,fintech has been in the focus of discussion for quite some time
2021-0103,1,"however, the market share of fintech companies is still relatively small compared to that of more traditional financial services"
2021-0103,2,"the purpose of this paper is to analyse the status quo, current developments, and challenges ahead for the latvian fintech sector"
2021-0103,3,"we combine three analyses: a political and legal, economic, social, and technological environment (pest) analysis"
2021-0103,4,a survey among fintech companies
2021-0103,5,and an analysis of the size and financial performance of fintech companies during the last 10 years
2021-0103,6,"we find that the current status of regulation is one of the main obstacles to fintech development, because it does not sufficiently consider fintech-specific aspects"
2021-0103,7,problems in attracting a skilled workforce and an environment that is not very supportive of new developments in finance are further challenges and might explain at least part of the growth and financial performance difficulties
2021-0103,8,"a revision, modernization, and harmonization of regulation is essential to create a level playing field for all market participants: fintech companies, traditional financial service providers, and those originally traditional players that are integrating fintech solutions in their business model"
2021-0103,9,further efforts are also required to foster latvias attractiveness for a skilled workforce
2021-0103,10,we hope that this study helps increase the visibility of latvian fintech and contributes to the development of the new latvian fintech strategy
2021-0069,0,we study the personal credit market using unique individual-level data covering fintech and traditional lenders
2021-0069,1,"we show that fintech lenders acquire market share by lending first to higher-risk borrowers and then to safer borrowers, and rely mainly on hard information to make credit decisions"
2021-0069,2,fintech borrowers are significantly more likely to default than neighbor individuals with the same characteristics borrowing from traditional financial institutions
2021-0069,3,"furthermore, they tend to experience a short-lived reduction in the cost of credit, because their indebtedness increases more than non-fintech borrowers after loan origination"
2021-0069,4,"however, fintech lenders' pricing strategies are likely to take this into account"
2021-0104,0,"this study aims to examine and validate the impact of big data analytical capabilities (individual, organizational, and technological) on bank performance via the mediating role of fintech innovation in commercial banks operating in the united arab emirates (uae)"
2021-0104,1,"based on a literature review, resource-based theory, and financial innovation theory, an integrated conceptual framework was developed to guide the study"
2021-0104,2,"a quantitative survey approach was used, and the data was collected from 236 banks senior managers (it, financial, and marketers)"
2021-0104,3,amos 21 structural equation modeling (sem) was used to analyze and verify the study variables
2021-0104,4,the main findings revealed that big data analytical capabilities had a significant positive influence on bank performance
2021-0104,5,fintech innovation acted as partial mediators in this relationship

2021-0105,0,"this study uses fintech approaches, including web crawler technology with distributed architecture to select internet news messages largely and efficiently and a dictionary-based linguistic text mining to create sentiment variables, to explore the respective impacts of investors' optimism and pessimism on stock returns"
2021-0105,1,the construction of sentiment variables in network- and dictionary-based messages is more precise and variable than that in traditional-based messages
2021-0105,2,"our results show that firms with investors' optimistic sentiments have significantly higher stock returns in the current month, whereas those with pessimistic sentiments have significantly opposite effects"
2021-0105,3,the effect of both investors' optimism and pessimism on stock returns subsequently reverses
2021-0105,4,"then, the negative impacts of investors' largely pessimistic sentiments on stock returns are larger than the positive impacts of their largely optimistic sentiments within a quarter"
2021-0105,5,"next, investors' optimistic sentiments significantly raise stock return volatility by approximately a quarter, but their pessimistic sentiments have the opposite effects"
2021-0105,6,"furthermore, investors' high optimism more significantly and persistently raises stock return volatility than their general optimism, but the negative effects of their high pessimism on volatility become smaller and the persistence is shorter than general pessimism"
2021-0105,7,"in addition to the advantage of our methodology in creating sentiment variables, the simultaneous consideration of investors' optimism and pessimism to analyze the effects on the returns and the volatility of individual stocks in this study is more complete than previous related studies"
2021-0070,0,this article probes how uneven access to digital financial technologies maps onto and reinforces existing inequalities in the global south
2021-0070,1,"grounded in sen's capability approach, it deploys a network science approach to examine emergent factors reinforcing techno-financial inequality or the uneven access to fintech instruments, such as mobile money (mm) or m-banking services"
2021-0070,2,"focusing on a case study in dhaka, bangladesh, our findings suggest that unequal access to mm services is driven by a lack of capability inputs (e.g., low income and savings) needed to access certain goods (e.g., mobile phones)"
2021-0070,3,"this lack affects and is affected by personal conversion factors (e.g., functional and financial illiteracies), environmental conversion factors within the mm ecosystem (e.g., unreliable mm operators), and socio-cultural practices (e.g., gender norms) within which mm services are embedded"
2021-0070,4,we argue that these factors must be understood and analyzed as a network of converging forces that constrain digital financial capabilities and wellbeing within the peripheries of the global south
2021-0070,5,"this network understanding highlights the need to avoid one-size-fits-all policy interventions, including moving beyond techno-centric paradigms that privilege the proffering of technological fixes: dumping more fintech instruments into global south markets"
2021-0070,6,"rather, fintech policy models must recognize and carefully address the intersection of micro and macro factors inhibiting fintech access in the global south"
2021-0059,0,prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance
2021-0059,1,"in this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (pd) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) originating from an emerging market"
2021-0059,2,"analysing indian fintech smes, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing smes in mitigating pd"
2021-0059,3,"we demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating pd at pre- and post-internationalization phases"
2021-0059,4,"at the pre-internationalization phase, directors prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e"
2021-0059,5,"greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning"
2021-0059,6,"taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments"
2021-0059,7,"further, we draw implications for research and practice"
2021-0006,0,the increasing pervasiveness of technology-driven firms that offer financial services has led to growing pressure on traditional banks to modernize their core business activities and services
2021-0006,1,many banks tackle the challenges of digitalization by cooperating with startup firms that offer technology-driven financial services and novel service packages (fintechs)
2021-0006,2,"in this article, we examine which banks typically collaborate with fintechs, how intensely they do so, and which form of alliance they prefer"
2021-0006,3,"using hand-collected data covering the largest banks from canada, france, germany, and the united kingdom, we provide detailed evidence on the different forms of alliances occurring in practice"
2021-0006,4,we show that banks are significantly more likely to form alliances with fintechs when they pursue a well-defined digital strategy and/or employ a chief digital officer
2021-0006,5,"moreover, in line with incomplete contract theory, we find that banks more frequently invest in small fintechs but often build product-related collaborations with larger fintechs"
2021-0106,0,"nowadays, understanding the complexity of fintech is vitally important due to its practical implication"
2021-0106,1,"thereby, it is one of the most relevant topics of financial research"
2021-0106,2,in the study we investigate the impact of fintech into social and economic development within modern society
2021-0106,3,"in particular, the attention is paid to the fintech companies' and the trends within ukrainian financial technology market"
2021-0106,4,"the further study concerns the nature of fintech innovative effects, namely: client, business and social effects"
2021-0106,5,"for further practical use, it is proposed to define fintech startups competencies, considering definition and functions of the main ukrainian startups innovative activity in financial sector"
2021-0107,0,this article examines the roles digital technologies have played in propelling the shifts in modes of financial governance which have been led by the chinese communist party and enacted by a wide spectrum of regulative actors
2021-0107,1,"based on analyses of the laws, policies and regulations surrounding digital financial technologies, or so-called fintechs, as well as in-depth interviews with government officials and fintech business executives, i argue that the proliferation of fintechs challenged the existing regulatory schemes defined by the central bank and the state council"
2021-0107,2,this forced a reconsideration of the chinese governments hegemonic strategies in governing the rapidly changing financial industries
2021-0107,3,"while digital technologies have been promoted to accomplish the goals set by the party for financial marketization and modernization, a set of institutions including regulatory, organizational and normative rules have been developed to strengthen the partys control over the digitization of finance"
2021-0107,4,this contradiction is pivotal to understanding the partys financial policymaking in the digital age
2021-0108,0,"on 1 september 2020, australias enhanced regulatory sandbox (ers) finally became operational"
2021-0108,1,"the ers replaced the previous fintech sandbox established and operated by the australian securities and investments commission (asic), which had existed since 2016 but attracted only seven participants"
2021-0108,2,this research analyses how and why australias sandbox framework  with its unique non-authorisation model of operation  has evolved until now and evaluates whether the new enhanced sandbox regime can help to achieve its stated objectives
2021-0108,3,this article shows that the current sandbox reform merely scrapes the surface of the many challenges underlying asics fintech sandbox and argues that these challenges can only be adequately resolved by revising the chosen sandbox model and switching to an authorisation-based sandbox design
2021-0109,0,the integration of the financial industry and financial technology (fintech) plays a pivotal role in increasing financial services reach and inclusion for the large unbanked population in indonesia
2021-0109,1,"fintech adoption optimization expands the financial access to formal financial institutions, especially to vulnerable groups such as the unbanked population who predominantly reside in rural areas far from formal financial institutions"
2021-0109,2,fintech is viewed as a game changer to bring finance to the unreached communities via information technology and digital financial landscape
2021-0109,3,"in this causal research, data collection was done via online questionnaires to 485 fintech users between december 2020 and april 2021"
2021-0109,4,data analysis and path modelling was performed using smartpls 3.0 software
2021-0109,5,"result shows user innovativeness as a significant predictor, directly and indirectly affecting the adoption of fintech in indonesia, while user attitude found the most important factor towards fintech adoption"
2021-0109,6,"financial literacy is the least important variable to predict fintech adoption, contrary to popular belief"
2021-0109,7,this indicates that fintech usage requires less financial literacy and is potential to reach unbanked population and those with low financial literacy
2021-0109,8,"to make fintech more inclusive, the government needs to accelerate improving information and communications technology (ict) infrastructure such as widening mobile broadband penetration and soft infrastructure by encouraging fintech startup, allowing regulatory sandbox for startups, and driving financial institutions to innovate through fintech to bring financial services to unbanked population"
2021-0110,0,"with transformative evolution involving crypto-assets, machine learning applications and data-driven finance models, complex regulatory and policy issues are emerging"
2021-0110,1,inadequate frameworks in fintech markets create regulatory friction and regulatory fragmentation

2021-0111,4,"we conducted an exploratory case study at ing, a global bank with a strong european base"
2021-0111,5,we interviewed 17 people with different roles and from different departments within the organization
2021-0111,6,"we have found that the following stages have been overlooked by previous lifecycle models: data collection, feasibility study, documentation, model monitoring, and model risk assessment"
2021-0111,7,our work shows that the real challenges of applying machine learning go much beyond sophisticated learning algorithms  more focus is needed on the entire lifecycle
2021-0111,8,"in particular, regardless of the existing development tools for machine learning, we observe that they are still not meeting the particularities of this field"

2021-0112,3,"paper also presents a discussion regarding the impact of fintech on three core businesses of the incumbent banks - infrastructure business, customer relationship business and product innovation business"
2021-0112,4,"the fintech-related disruptive innovations have greatest potential in the areas, which are outside the core competencies of banks and are difficult to assimilate into the existing architecture of the banking business"
2021-0112,5,the repertoire of incumbent bank strategies for addressing the challenges of fintech innovation is given special consideration
2021-0113,0,this research attempt to analyze risk and benefit factors as well as their influence on sustainability intention of fintech
2021-0113,1,we elucidate the planned behavior theory by including the perceived benefits and perceived risk variables to investigate its effect on intention to continue using fintech
2021-0113,2,we also examined whether or not men and women are affected differently by the benefits and risk they perceive when using fintech
2021-0113,3,"data were collected through online surveys, then being analyzed using gsca"
2021-0113,4,the results reveal perceived benefits are affected significantly by the convenience aspect and deliver a significant effect on fintech continuance intention
2021-0113,5,the risk perceived by fintech users is affected the most by legal risk
2021-0113,6,"this study proves that gender is able to moderate the perceived risk influence on the intention to continue using fintech, especially in the female user group"
2021-0114,0,"the recent developments of information technology have led to more automation process that enforce a fundamental reorganization of the business models of financial services value chain and highly recognized with the term 'financial technology""or ""fintech""in short"
2021-0114,1,the research analyzed the important factors that affect the usage behavior as well as the effectiveness towards usage behavior of fintech 3.0 adoptions in one of the well-known private banks in indonesia
2021-0114,2,the findings of the test showed that four out of five variables have significant value towards the hypothesis of this research
2021-0114,3,"this means the likelihood of people use fintech is mostly determined by the perceived of usefulness, ease, and availability of required resources"
2021-0114,4,this information is significant to the banks to innovate their services and products that will be in accordance with customers' preference as well in competing with other non-financial industry
2021-0114,5,"with the dynamic changes and competitive advantages offered by various parties, this research extends the existing literatures by providing real insights from the users of fintech in one of the prominent buku 4 (commercial bank based on business activities) with a core capital of more than idr 30 trillion"
2021-0114,6,"in indonesia's banking industry, the reputation of this institution in this research is more than enough to make people choose their services and gain trust to use the technology"
2021-0114,7,"however, this might not be the case with other banks, considering the market competitiveness between financial and non-financial institutions"
2021-0115,0,this study predicts factors affecting the tendency to use financial technology (fintech) services post-covid-19 lockdown as a new normal behavior
2021-0115,1,fintech services have boosted the number of users during the covid-19 lockdown
2021-0115,2,"however, to maintain the loyal behavior of consumers after usage, firms need to predict key reasons to enhance their intention to use the service and maintain current consumers in the long term"
2021-0115,3,this study offers a model to assess the components of the perceived usefulness toward fintech
2021-0115,4,"data were collected via mechanical turk (mturk), and structural equation modeling was used to predict the factors that influence the intention and loyalty to use fintech post-covid-19 lockdown"
2021-0115,5,"the findings reveal that the covid-19 lockdown, trust, data security and privacy, and especially staff services are factors that enhance the intention to use through perceived usefulness"
2021-0115,6,"in return, it builds consumers loyalty toward fintech services and is considered a new normal behavior"
2021-0115,7,this research sheds light on how fintech firms develop their capabilities and increase their competitive advantages
2021-0115,8,both theoretical and practical implications are also discussed
2021-0061,0,the expansion of fintech credit around the world is challenging the global banking system
2021-0061,1,this study investigates the interrelationships between the development of fintech credit and the efficiency of banking systems in 80 countries from 2013 to 2017
2021-0061,2,the findings indicate a two-way relationship between them
2021-0061,3,"more specifically, a negative relationship between bank efficiency and fintech credit implies that fintech credit is more developed in countries with less efficient banking systems"
2021-0061,4,"meanwhile, a positive impact of fintech credit on the efficiency of banking systems suggests that fintech credit may serve as a wake-up call to the banking system"
2021-0061,5,"therefore, fintech credit should be encouraged by the authorities around the world"
2021-0071,0,"financial technology (fintech) has been playing an increasingly critical role in driving modern economies, society, technology, and many other areas"

2021-0116,0,"financial technology (fintech) services have come to differentiate themselves from traditional financial services by offering unique, niche, and customized services"
2021-0116,1,mobile payment service (mps) has emerged as the most crucial fintech service
2021-0116,2,"while many studies have addressed the essential role of security when service providers and users choose to engage in financial transactions, the relationship between users distinct perceptions of security and mps success determinants are yet to be examined"
2021-0116,3,"thus, this study primarily aims to uncover the distinctive roles of platform and technology security by investigating how users react differently to their varying understandings of the mps usage environment"
2021-0116,4,"this study proposes a research model comprising two security dimensions (platform and technology) and three mps success determinants (convenience, interoperability, and trust)"
2021-0116,5,we evaluated the proposed model empirically by using an online survey of 356 users
2021-0116,6,the survey accounts users experiences of the selected mps
2021-0116,7,the results show that a security driven mps can essentially enhance or deteriorate users positive perceptions of mps success determinants while they use it for financial transactions
2021-0116,8,"to further understand how this recent trend of user perception of security affects the overall mps usage experience, this study provides theoretical insights into the roles of platform and technology securities"
2021-0116,9,managerial insights on the design strategies of mps providers are also provided based on the potential implications of users subjective and objective perceptions of mps security environment
2021-0072,0,fintech platforms are one of the most important elements in the rapidly digitized worlds economy
2021-0072,1,"this study investigates the factors that affected individuals acceptance of fintech services, especially on internet wealth management platforms"
2021-0072,2,"the current research extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) published by mis quarterly with integrated financial consumption attributes (i.e., perceived value and perceived risk) alongside the core construct of utaut"
2021-0072,3,data were collected from an established survey company
2021-0072,4,"the empirical results indicate that perceived value, perceived risk, and social influence are strongly related to individuals fintech adoption intention, whereas performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived risk affect individuals perceived value, which in turn influences adoption intention"
2021-0072,5,the proposed fintech adoption model could contribute to information technology (it) adoption research by extending the utaut in which individuals performance expectancy and effort expectancy affect their adoption intention indirectly through perceived value
2021-0072,6,"finally, the implications of the proposed new model for future research and fintech practice are discussed"

2021-0043,2,"the concept of customer experience is multidimensional, analysed from various perspectives, and with distinct valences in different industries"
2021-0043,3,"based on the stimulus-organism-response (s-o-r) approach, we proposed a model in which customer experience in fintech is the result of customers evaluation of the stimuli proposed by fintech companies"
2021-0043,4,"using partial least squares equation modelling (pls-sem), we tested a series of hypotheses and validated the proposed model"
2021-0043,5,"the results showed that perceived value, customer support, assurance, speed and perceived firm innovativeness are positively related to customer experience in fintech"
2021-0043,6,"in turn, customer experience is positively associated with loyalty intentions of the customer"
2021-0043,7,"our paper contributes in identifying the dimensions, the determinants and the outcomes of customer experience in fintech, while from a managerial perspective, we demonstrate how fintech companies must integrate customer experience in their business models"

2021-0050,1,"i show that the consequences of fintech are full of controversies, which are part of broader, long-standing debates on the role of finance in economy and society, and need to be approached from geographical perspectives"
2021-0050,2,"the intense fusion of fin and tech, arguably accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, complicates and elevates these controversies to a new level"
2021-0013,0,"in this paper, we identify the ways in which the existing literature has examined financial technology (fintech)"
2021-0013,1,"using the frame of the fintech cube, we examine how fintech unfolds through the intersections of key actors, technologies and institutions"
2021-0013,2,"we demonstrate the relevance of fintech for two areas of geographical enquiry: i) the reshaping of global production and financial networks, and ii) financial inclusion and poverty reduction in poorer countries"
2021-0013,3,"in doing so, we accord particular attention to the significance of fintech for theoretical and empirical research in economic geography"
2021-0034,0,we study the formation and dynamics of entrepreneurial clusters in the emerging fintech industry
2021-0034,1,"using detailed data on the almost 1000 fintech startups in france to date, we find that most fintechs are geographically clustered and that the location of new fintech startups is affected, among other things, by the size of clusters and the presence of incubators"
2021-0034,2,"larger clusters attract more new fintech startups, and incubators are shown to be an effective mechanism to attract new fintech startups"
2021-0034,3,we further examine entrepreneurial exits of fintechs and find that being located in a larger cluster reduces the risk of failure but increases the likelihood of being acquired
2021-0034,4,increased competition within a given segment of fintech increases failure rates
2021-0034,5,"moreover, the risk of failure is significantly lower for fintech startups that have been developed in an incubator"

2021-0121,1,"using data from the chinese general social survey and the index of digital financial inclusion, this study examines the impact of fintech on the gender wage gap"
2021-0121,2,we find that fintech (i) narrows the gender wage gap
2021-0121,3,"(ii) reduces capital constraints and operating costs, thereby promoting female entrepreneurship, driving more women into employment, and enabling women to increase their wages and bargaining power within the household"
2021-0121,4,"and (iii) positively impacts the wages of women (and men) who have lower family economic status, and helps women (but not men) counter the risk of decline in wages caused by childbearing and caring under the two-child policy"

2021-0021,0,"this paper is one of the first to offer a comprehensive analysis of the impact of green finance related policies in china, utilizing text analysis and panel data from 290 cities between 2011 and 2018"
2021-0021,1,employing the semi-parametric difference-in-differences (sdid) we show that overall china's green finance related policies have led to a significant reduction in industrial gas emissions in the review period
2021-0021,2,"additionally, we found that fintech development contributes to the depletion of sulphur dioxide emissions and has a positive impact on environmental protection investment initiatives"
2021-0021,3,china is poised to be a global leader in green finance policy implementation and regulators need to accelerate the formulation of green finance products and enhance the capacity of financial institutions to offer green credit
2021-0021,4,"while minimizing the systemic risk fintech poses, policy makers should encourage fintechs to actively participate in environmental protection initiatives that promote green consumption"
2021-0122,0,"the availability of financial technology services, accessibility, ease of use and performance, transaction costs, and service security of fintech have a positive and significant effect on banks' customer satisfaction"

2021-0073,5,"furthermore, this paper highlights the importance of european and global regulation, mainly from the perspective of consumer protection"
2021-0123,0,rationally justifying bitcoin's immense price fluctuations has remained a persistent challenge for both investors and researchers in this field
2021-0123,1,a primary reason is our potential weakness toward robustly quantifying unquantifiable risks or ambiguity in bitcoin returns
2021-0123,2,this paper introduces a behavioral channel to argue that the degree of ambiguity aversion is a prominent source of abnormal returns from investment in bitcoin markets
2021-0123,3,"using data over a ten-year period, we show that bitcoin investors exhibit, on average, an increasing aversion to ambiguity"
2021-0123,4,"furthermore, investors are found to earn abnormal returns only when ambiguity is low"
2021-0123,5,robustness exercises reassure on the validity of our results
2021-0015,0,this paper examines whether the development of the financial technology (fintech) industry affects cost efficiency and the technology adopted for china's banking industry over the period 20032017
2021-0015,1,"fintech industry development indices are constructed using fintech enterprise-level data, and these indices measure the development extent of entire fintech industry and four sub-industries including (1) credit, deposit and capitalraising services, (2) payment, clearing and settlement services, (3) investment management services and (4) market support services"
2021-0015,2,the relevant efficiency scores for chinese banks under different ownership structures are measured by applying the stochastic metafrontier approach
2021-0015,3,the results show that state-owned commercial banks have the lowest cost efficiency and operate under inferior technology
2021-0015,4,"when considering the influence of fintech development, fintech innovations not only improve the cost efficiency of banks, but also enhance the technology used by banks"
2021-0015,5,this double beneficial effect is more significant in the case of market support service innovations
2021-0074,0,financial technology (fintech) has flourished in recent years
2021-0074,1,"from 2008 to 2016, the global investment in fintech increased more than threefold"
2021-0074,2,"however, most of the extant literature has focused on fintech innovation or the litigation of financial patents, while few studies have explored the effects of fintech patents in the financial industry"
2021-0074,3,"therefore, this paper employs machine learning algorithms for classification and association rule purposes in order to analyze the relationship between fintech patents and performance from 2008 to 2016"
2021-0074,4,our results show that fintech patents can indeed improve the profitability of the financial industry
2021-0074,5,we also find that the influence of return on asset is more significant than that of return on equity

2021-0076,0,this article focuses on the relationship between fintech and bank risk-taking behavior
2021-0076,1,"since robo-advisor is one of the mature applications of fintech, we found that the development of fintech will have a greater impact on small and medium-sized banks through the establishment of a robo-advisor model"
2021-0076,2,this paper uses a benchmark regression model to analyze the municipal digital financial inclusion index compiled by peking university and the annual report data of 155 small and medium-sized banks from 2011 to 2016
2021-0076,3,we found that the development of fintech has significantly reduced bank risk-taking level
2021-0076,4,this result is still valid after the robustness test of replacing the banks risk-taking index and replacing the fintech development index
2021-0076,5,"we used the urban innovation index as an instrumental variable to deal with the endogenous problem, and obtained consistent estimation results"
2021-0076,6,"the test of the intermediary effect shows that the development of fintech will affect the bank risk-taking through channels such as the banks internal interest margin, management capabilities, the banks external competition intensity, and residents saving willingness"
2021-0076,7,"heterogeneity analysis shows the reduction effect of fintech on bank risk-taking is more pronounced in banks in eastern and western regions in china, the large banks and the urban commercial banks"
2021-0052,0,ending poverty in all its forms by 2030 remains the first agenda of sustainable development goals set by the united nations in 2015

2021-0052,4,the results further showed that fintech complements economic growth and financial development to reduce poverty in china
2021-0077,0,the role of digital technostress and self-efficacy in digital marketing research is seldom discussed and even more rarely examined among gen z consumers
2021-0077,1,"this study investigates the relationships between four sub-dimensions of technostress (complexity, overload, invasion, and uncertainty), digital technology self-efficacy, and fintech usage intention"
2021-0077,2,data from a total of 266 chinese gen z consumers were used in multiple regression analysis
2021-0077,3,the results of the study generally support that all sub-dimensions of technostress were negatively related to fintech usage intention
2021-0077,4,"related to the moderating effects of digital technology self-efficacy on the relationship between the four sub-dimensions of technostress and fintech usage intention, significant interaction effects with complexity and overload were found"
2021-0077,5,"finally, the study discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings"
2021-0078,0,"although fintechs and incumbents are applying artificial intelligence (ai) differently, they both expect that the status-quo will likely be maintained through collaboration rather than competition"
2021-0078,1,both perceive bigtechs as a strategic threat given their ai capabilities and their entrance into financial services
2021-0078,2,incumbents are experimenting with more different kinds of ai than fintechs: fintechs use the technologies for new products and services while incumbents are using them for incremental innovations to existing products and services
2021-0078,3,"the incumbents expect that adopting ai will lead to a loss in jobs of 9% over the next 10 years and, because these companies represent a large percentage of the workforce (median company size surveyed has more than 10,000 employees), this loss in jobs cannot be compensated by the 19% increase in jobs provided by existing fintechs (median company size surveyed has less than 50 employees)"
2021-0078,4,"ai can reduce and increase risk, and most incumbents and fintechs agree that there will be no effect on risk at the organizational level but that there will be an increase in risk at the societal level"
2021-0078,5,"while both fintechs and incumbents agree on the relative importance of legal and human hurdles and consider the biggest hurdle is related to data and regulations concerning data, fintechs perceive these hurdles to be greater than do incumbents"
2021-0020,0,"artificial intelligence (ai) is creating a rush of opportunities in the financial sector, but financial organizations need to be aware of the risks inherent in the use of this technology"
2021-0020,1,"financial organizations are integrating ai in their operations: in-house, outsourced, or ecosystem-based"
2021-0020,2,"the growth of ai-based fintech firms has encouraged several mergers and acquisitions among financial service providers and wealth managers as they grapple with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity"
2021-0020,3,ai's unique promise of combined cost reduction and increased differentiation makes it generally attractive across the board
2021-0020,4,"however, perhaps other than fraud detection, these benefits depend on the scale of an organization"

2021-0153,9,"the national banking system, founded in 1863, envisioned the creation of a uniform medium of exchange in the form of national bank notes, which replaced the preexisting system of state bank note issuance"
2021-0153,10,but the creation of the national banking system soon resulted in the diminished importance of bank notes as a medium of exchange
2021-0153,11,"under the new system, state banks faced a prohibitive tax of 10 percent per year on any notes they issued, and national banks had to maintain collateral at the treasury for their outstanding national bank notes equal to 111 percent of their outstanding notes, and also had to maintain an additional 5 percent in required government-currency (greenback) cash reserves on hand"

2021-0156,2,fintech enables institutions to deliver services to customers worldwide on a 24/7 basis
2021-0156,3,its services are often easy to access and enable customers to perform transactions in real-time
2021-0156,4,"in fact, advantages such as these make fintech increasingly popular among clients"
2021-0156,5,"however, since fintech transactions are made up of information, ensuring security becomes a critical issue"
2021-0156,6,"vulnerabilities in such systems leave them exposed to fraudulent acts, which cause severe damage to clients and providers alike"
2021-0156,7,"for this reason, techniques from the area of machine learning (ml) are applied to identify anomalies in fintech applications"
2021-0156,8,they target suspicious activity in financial datasets and generate models in order to anticipate future frauds
2021-0156,9,we contribute to this important issue and provide an evaluation on anomaly detection methods for this matter
2021-0156,10,"experiments were conducted on several fraudulent datasets from real-world and synthetic databases, respectively"
2021-0156,11,the obtained results confirm that ml methods contribute to fraud detection with varying success
2021-0156,12,"therefore, we discuss the effectiveness of the individual methods with regard to the detection rate"
2021-0156,13,"in addition, we provide an analysis on the influence of selected features on their performance"
2021-0156,14,"finally, we discuss the impact of the observed results for the security of fintech applications in the future"
2021-0080,0,"in the last few years, the united arab emirates (uae) has emerged as a regional hub serving as an incubator of the fintech ecosystem, where regulators began implementing policies to encourage the growth of fintech ventures in 2017"

2021-0080,6,"the findings suggest that the availability of resources, in particular through venture capital, is vital to the success and survival of fintechs as microbusinesses"
2021-0080,7,"however, financial barriers, the regulatory environment, and legal issues have a detrimental impact on facilitating the creation and growth of fintech ventures"
2021-0080,8,"furthermore, the business model dimensions product/service offering and value proposition tend to influence the success of these ventures"
2021-0080,9,the empirical models findings will serve as a data-driven tool to help guide finance policymakers in their decisions on how to promote this new sector
2021-0025,0,clean and modern energy is still inaccessible for large sections of rural populations globally with sub-saharan africa being the largest
2021-0025,1,rising population and unfolding climate change only compound this problem
2021-0025,2,"however, sub-saharan countries  especially ones with large populations and economies  must find avenues to sustainably finance renewable energy development, including in otherwise ignored rural areas where climate vulnerability is disproportionately high"
2021-0025,3,"here we argue that small-scale renewable energy financing from multilateral financial institutions (mfis), banks and government has been long neglected and combining the inherent strengths of community based organisations (cbos) with technology can help improve access to small-scale renewable energy finance in rural sub-saharan africa"
2021-0157,0,"in this research, we communicate the design and evaluation of a consumer financial goals ontology to be utilized as a knowledgebase within recommender systems applications designed to provide decision support in the domain of financial planning"
2021-0157,1,the goal of this research is to provide a domain conceptualization and knowledge classification of a comprehensive set of financial capability enhancing objectives contextually appropriate for a wide range of socio-economically situated consumers
2021-0157,2,"currently, to the best of our knowledge, within the domain of consumer financial planning no formal conceptual model or knowledge classification of financial goals exists which might be utilized as a knowledgebase for applications such as a fintech recommender system"
2021-0157,3,"achieving financial goals is a key behavior associated with consumer financial capability, a topic of national economic importance"
2021-0157,4,a holistic representation of domain concepts is critical for advancement of solutions to problems pertinent to a domain
2021-0157,5,one primary reason for the dearth of applications designed to assist consumers with financial goal setting is the absence of a common domain ontology of financial goals
2021-0157,6,this study addresses a gap in the literature by contributing to the research knowledgebase an ontology for a domain of consumer financial goals
2021-0157,7,"in doing so, it advances scholarly research through novel domain knowledge classification while providing researchers and practitioners with an ontological knowledgebase for indexing and retrieval within applications designed to improve consumer financial capability through identification and recommendation of specific, context-aware financial goals"
2021-0157,8,"the ontology could be used, for example, as a knowledgebase for a personal financial recommender system (pfrs), or other financial technology (fintech) application, designed to assist users with identification, setting, and tracking of financial goals"
2021-0005,0,this study examines the impact of financial technology (fintech) on the ability of banks to offer credit to small and medium enterprises (smes)
2021-0005,1,"by analyzing the lending records of banks in chinese provinces from 2011 to 2018, we demonstrate that fintech effectively facilitates the banking sector's credit supply to smes"
2021-0005,2,we also consider whether the impact of fintech varies according to the size of the bank
2021-0005,3,"compared with small banks, fintech has a more significant influence on the increase in credit for smes in large banks"
2021-0005,4,"thus, maybe it is more important to utilize fintech than to develop many small banks"
2021-0055,0,this study measures the risk of the emerging fintech industry in china and identifies its influencing risk factors by calculating the tail risk of fintech stock index
2021-0055,1,the expectile regression model that includes the lagged returns and macroeconomic risk factors is used to calculate the expectile value-at-risk (evar)
2021-0055,2,"based on the 1230 daily returns of fintech index ranges from july 2, 2014, to september 10, 2019, the empirical results indicate that the fintech industry possesses a higher risk, and is affected by both the past development and internal macroeconomic condition"

2021-0158,5,"know-hows like machine learning, ai, and predictive analytics in financial services can directly affect overall business policy, revenue generation, and resource optimization"
2021-0159,0,"based on the data of peer-to-peer (p2p) platforms, employing the arimax model and analyzing the risk outbreak process of p2p platforms, we find that the risk outbreak of p2p is a spreading process from weak to strong along the qualification chain of the platforms"
2021-0159,1,this risk outbreak process along the qualification chain is dubbed the fuze effect in this paper as the process is similar to that of the fuze detonating explosives
2021-0159,2,"this finding implies that the real risk comes from the uneven quality of p2p platforms, which is different from the dominant opinion that of their credit enhancement services"
2021-0159,3,our further study suggests that the fuze effect comes from deadweight cost caused by market competition
2021-0159,4,this study is of significance for risk prevention in emerging industries such as fintech
2021-0159,5,"that is, for the sake of sustainable development of emerging industries, the government must be vigilant about the fuze effect"

2021-0026,2,"the biggest challenge for many governments across the globe is not only setting priorities in which fintech services to invest (e.g., digital wallets, peer-to-peer lending, e-insurances) but also in which geographical area to invest"
2021-0026,3,"since technology is independent of physical interaction and geographical confinement, governments face a dilemma: keep fintech growth geographically diverse or concentrated within a few cities"
2021-0026,4,this study evaluates the fintech success of countries with its spread in different cities and attempts to formulate a policy direction to accelerate the wave of the fourth industrial revolution
2021-0026,5,"our results suggest that rather than a widespread presence, countries should concentrate their efforts, investment, and attention to developing a fintech ecosystem in fewer cities to facilitate them as much as possible"
2021-0026,6,this concentrated effort could help countries improve their global fintech scores and specialize in specific core areas
2021-0010,0,small and medium enterprises (smes) play a vital role in an economy
2021-0010,1,"therefore, it is important to study the avenues that contribute towards their viability"

2021-0171,1,"design/methodology/approach: this study uses an aggregate dataset of 73 countries from 2013 to 2018 to examine the nexus between fintech credit, bank regulations and bank performance"
2021-0171,2,"for robustness tests, the authors introduce different proxies of fintech credit, perform sub-sample analysis and substitute control variables, as well as conduct their empirical strategy to tackle potential endogeneity issue"
2021-0171,3,findings: the authors document some significant findings
2021-0171,4,"first, the authors evidence implies that fintech credit tends to reduce bank profitability, while improving bank risk-related performance"
2021-0171,5,"this suggests that as fintech grows, it competes with banks and takes some share of profits, but it also benefits banks in terms of stability"
2021-0171,6,"second, stricter regulations contribute positively to bank stability"
2021-0171,7,"third, the authors argue that the impact of fintech credit on bank performance may depend on the degree of banking regulation, and find that fintech credit would impose a more positive influence on bank stability as more stringent banking regulation is present"
2021-0171,8,"originality/value: this study is the first to investigate whether fintech credit influences bank performance, considering the moderating impact of bank regulations"
2021-0171,9,the findings imply that fintech credit tends to be more beneficial when bank regulations become stricter
2021-0171,10,"therefore, they bring relevant implications to the regulators, as well as bank and fintech managers with regard to the potential cooperation"
2021-0081,0,"the fintech industry in indonesia is developed to facilitate more loans for micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes) across the archipelago"
2021-0081,1,"but, since early 2018 to present, the investment alert task force and the ministry of communication and informatics have blocked 3,198 illegal fintech platforms"
2021-0081,2,"with technological advances in the financial sector in indonesia, it also has an impact on the rise of illegal fintech"
2021-0081,3,the purpose of this study is to see the effect of financial literacy on illegal fintech in msmes
2021-0081,4,"the data in this study were taken from msmes in west java, indonesia as many as 300 respondents"
2021-0081,5,the research method used is a quantitative method using questionnaire data
2021-0081,6,the data analysis method uses simple linear regression with spss software
2021-0081,7,this research model was created to answer research questions that will look at the relationship between financial literacy and illegal fintech in msmes in west java
2021-0081,8,the results of the analysis above state that financial literacy has a significant effect on illegal fintech
2021-0081,9,"many people are trapped in illegal fintech because it provides convenience in transactions such as easy and fast loan applications, although not cheap (fine fees and loan interest)"
2021-0081,10,"therefore, financial literacy is very important to cut the rampant illegal fintech in indonesia"
2021-0081,11,this study is the first study to examine specifically the effect of financial literacy on illegal fintech on msmes in indonesia
2021-0081,12,the findings of this study are very interesting because it is true that financial literacy is a very important variable in eradicating the rise of illegal fintech
2021-0081,13,so that msmes can increase and grow without fraud from illegal fintech
2021-0172,0,"in modern times, enhancing energy efficiency is one of the core agenda items for the economies to progress the world"
2021-0172,1,united nations general assembly has recommended increasing energy efficiency by considering the sdg-7 guidelines
2021-0172,2,"in the contemporary period, e7 economies are deficient in producing the financial resources to ensure the availability of funds for the acquisition of energy efficiency"
2021-0172,3,"covid-19 crises, lack of resilience in economies, devastating fiscal burdens, and tight monetary conditions of e7 economies are the major barriers"
2021-0172,4,"to resolve such issues, some innovative financing techniques, such as green financing, financial inclusion, and fintech, were suggested to investigate"
2021-0172,5,"however, this research tested the empirical role of financial inclusion, green financing, and fintech on the energy efficiency of e7 economies"
2021-0172,6,study findings have shown a significant role of such financing techniques on energy efficiency
2021-0172,7,"comparatively, green financing is found most fitting and highly supportive financing tool for energy efficiency among the three"
2021-0172,8,"the differences in attributes, financing mechanism, funds flow system, transection systems, and variation in support by the financial institution are the main reasons that lessen the role of financial inclusion and fintech for energy efficiency"
2021-0172,9,"however, theorists must revisit the transaction system of fintech and financial inclusion parameters like green bonds for energy efficiency attainment"
2021-0172,10,"policymakers are suggested to develop viable and energy system-friendly policies to grant green finance to the energy systems of e7 economies, as conveniently as possible"
2021-0173,0,"financial technology-based firms (fintech) are crucial to promoting new technologies and advances in innovations related to the financial field, sustainable development, and financial inclusion"
2021-0173,1,"this paper aims to assess the sustainable development goals (sdgs) and open innovation integrated within the public discourse in the social media of fintech firms, using machine-learning-based social media analysis (sma)"
2021-0173,2,"accordingly, we tracked the behavior of 21 firms based on the empirical material of 32,716 posts on twitter"
2021-0173,3,the outcomes showed dissimilar discourses based on fintech firms activities
2021-0173,4,"however, it was found that only financial infrastructure, lending, and personal finance fields have a discourse related to innovation and, to a lesser extent, related to the sdgs thematic"
2021-0173,5,"thus, awareness of sustainable objectives is still far from being a relevant issue for fintech, which, in general, has neglected to significantly mention sdgs"
2021-0173,6,"nonetheless, innovation and related terms are a consistent topic in this area"
2021-0173,7,"furthermore, hints of the implementation of the open innovation paradigm and interest in novel technologies are demonstrated, in addition to the promotion of different actors and events on social media that serve as a showcase for firms that have a presence on twitter"
2021-0174,0,purpose: this paper aims to explore the prospects and the challenges of islamic fintech in indonesia
2021-0174,1,this study also proposes a comprehensive legal framework to encourage and accelerate the growth of the islamic economy
2021-0174,2,design/methodology/approach: this study is the result of legal research with a statute approach and conceptual approach
2021-0174,3,the types of data used are legal materials consisting of primary legal materials and secondary legal materials
2021-0174,4,the technique of collecting legal materials is done by using library research techniques
2021-0174,5,the legal materials were analyzed using the legal norm method
2021-0174,6,findings: indonesia is a country with the largest muslim population in the world
2021-0174,7,"however, the market size of indonesias islamic fintech is still below saudi arabia, iran, united arab emirates (uae) and malaysia"
2021-0174,8,"saudi arabias islamic fintech is the biggest market in the world, with $17.9bn worth of transactions in 2020 while iran is at $9.2bn, uae $3.7bn, malaysia $3.0bn and indonesia $2.9bn"
2021-0174,9,"this condition was due to various challenges in the islamic fintech industry in indonesia, including inadequate regulations"
2021-0174,10,complicated permit procedures
2021-0174,11,misuse of fintech for financing terrorism
2021-0174,12,rampant occurrence of illegal fintech businesses
2021-0174,13,and consumer disputes in the fintech sector
2021-0174,14,these challenges require the construction of a comprehensive legal framework through the formation of an act on fintech
2021-0174,15,research limitations/implications: the focus of this research was limited to the problems occurring in the islamic fintech sector in indonesia as a country with the largest muslim population in the world
2021-0174,16,practical implications: the results of this research can be used as recommendations for the formulation of comprehensive policies for the growth and development of islamic fintech
2021-0174,17,"social implications: islamic fintech requires a comprehensive legal framework that functions to encourage the development of the islamic fintech industry, digital economy growth and legal mitigation of various legal risks and misuse of fintech for financial crime and financing terrorism"
2021-0174,18,originality/value: this paper proposes an original idea of creating a legal framework in a form of the islamic fintech act
2021-0174,19,the act should cover such legal substances as follows: islamic compliance
2021-0174,20,an integrated one-stop permit procedure
2021-0174,21,"division of authority, coordination and synergy among authorities"
2021-0174,22,prevention and resolution of digital financial system crisis
2021-0174,23,criminal sanctions
2021-0174,24,and consumer dispute resolution mechanisms and alternative institution for fintech consumer dispute resolution
2021-0175,0,"fintech adoption index, expressed as a percentage of the digitally active population, for 27 countries of the world in 2019 reached the level of 64%"
2021-0175,1,"millennials are the generation which, compared to others, is characterized by the highest level of fintech adoptions"
2021-0175,2,"in poland, in 2019, about 75% of the millennials used the services of fintech"
2021-0175,3,this paper aims to analyse and evaluate the selected determinants of using the innovative fintech services by millennials in poland
2021-0175,4,"to investigate how users adopt fintech services, we have applied our own set of determinants  selected from an extensive literature review  covering both demographic, economic and behavioural characteristics"
2021-0175,5,this approach allowed for an in-depth analysis of the examined issue
2021-0175,6,the essential empirical data were obtained based on the research using the cawi method in december 2019 on a representative sample of poles aged 2540 at that time
2021-0175,7,"ultimately, 1,236 correctly completed questionnaires were used for the research"
2021-0175,8,"to analyse and evaluate the impact of selected determinants of fintech adoption, a logistic regression model was used"
2021-0175,9,the results obtained can thus be extremely important for managers of financial institutions
2021-0175,10,they provide information that can be used for activities aimed at maintaining fintechs customer base and allow to adjust the offer to the expectations of this group
2021-0175,11,millennials most open to innovative fintech services in poland are young men with high and very high net income and not driven by low costs of financial services
2021-0175,12,"they appreciate technological novelties, including the possibility of using a smartwatch, and when deciding on the choice of a financial institution, they do not care about the direct opinions of their relatives and friends, but take into account the opinions in social media"
2021-0176,0,this study analyses the predictive power of press releases for the performance of fintech start-ups
2021-0176,1,"using quantitative content analysis, we investigate a sample of 1570 press releases, issued between 2007 and 2016, and refer to the structural, linguistic and content elements of these business disclosures"
2021-0176,2,"our results suggest that the sentiment, complexity, psychological distance and future-orientation of announcements are positively associated with the fintechs performance, while a negative interaction is revealed for the frequency"
2021-0176,3,"with regard to the content categories, we provide evidence that news about financing rounds, partnerships, and business development are positively related to the venture growth"

2021-0177,0,purpose: fintech is having a profound impact in sub-saharan africa (ssa) because it offers more financial inclusion
2021-0177,1,"in this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of fintech, base of the pyramid (bop) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the ssa context"
2021-0177,2,"design/methodology/approach: the current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources"
2021-0177,3,the authors interviewed respondents from the sierra leone fintech association and four bop entrepreneurs operating in different sectors
2021-0177,4,"findings: the authors find that fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations"
2021-0177,5,"fintech also offers growth possibilities for bop entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies"
2021-0177,6,"at the same time, fintech contributes to social value by enhancing bop entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development"
2021-0177,7,"research limitations/implications: this study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between bop entrepreneurship, social value creation and fintech"
2021-0177,8,"for example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like fintech"
2021-0177,9,"however, in a country like sierra leone, which has experienced both a civil war and ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by bop inhabitants"
2021-0177,10,"hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on fintech's application in bop contexts"
2021-0177,11,practical implications: a key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits
2021-0177,12,fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs
2021-0177,13,fintech offers bop entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development
2021-0177,14,"from a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more bop entrepreneurs using these services"
2021-0177,15,"social implications: the authors find that at the same time, fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of bop consumers who interact with case firms"
2021-0177,16,originality/value: this paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on bop entrepreneurship and social value creation by fintech services in an ssa context
2021-0177,17,"it is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or fintech firms"
2021-0177,18,"finally, there is a specific focus on bop entrepreneurs engaging in micro-entrepreneurship"
2021-0178,0,purpose: this paper aims to provide a review of literature directions regarding the potential impact of fintech operators on the financial services market globally
2021-0178,1,this paper reviews the literature to identify possible benefits or challenges that fintech firms can have for the traditional banking system
2021-0178,2,design/methodology/approach: this paper is based on a review of published research papers related to fintech and digital finance
2021-0178,3,"the scopus database, ssrn database and google scholar were used to find relevant research papers"
2021-0178,4,the final sample included impactful papers about the effect of fintech activities on the banking and financial services industry
2021-0178,5,"findings: the current paper indicated that while fintech firms would take some market share away from banks, it is not expected that fintech firms would substitute banks"
2021-0178,6,"however, banks are required to accelerate their adoption of innovations and advanced technology to compete with fintech firms"
2021-0178,7,it is also proposed that strategic partnerships and cooperation could happen between banks and fintech companies in a way that benefits both sides
2021-0178,8,originality/value: the present paper adds to the understanding of the effect of the fintech firms growth on the banking industry in light of the emerging opportunities and threats for the financial sector
2021-0178,9,the paper also provides guidance for fruitful research on the impact of fintech activities on social and economic welfare in the future
2021-0179,0,financial institutions play a pivotal role in the efficient allocation of capital resources
2021-0179,1,"however, some households and firms may be excluded from formal financial markets due to asymmetric information and market imperfections, thereby adversely affecting equitable income distribution"
2021-0179,2,"on the other hand, among other things, access to finance is viewed as one of the key tools to fight poverty"
2021-0179,3,"this study develops a novel double ffi model and applies the structural equation modelling to simultaneously analyze the interaction between financial technology, financial inclusion, and income inequality in a panel of 25 african countries over the periods 2011, 2014, and 2017"
2021-0179,4,the results show that financial inclusion mediates the financial technology-income inequality relationship thus playing a fundamental role in reducing income inequality in africa
2021-0179,5,"on the policy front, the study urges african policymakers and regulators to craft policies that enhance fintech developments and financial inclusion"
2021-0180,0,"this paper discusses the role of deleuzian philosophy in fintech projects which operate in the wild, i.e"
2021-0180,1,"far from the major institutional settings of fintech development, and which speculate towards an alternative financial economy, building upon algorithms, blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and crypto-assets"
2021-0180,2,"based on ethnographic data collected with three different projects, i discuss the process of earmarking financial operations by means of philosophical concepts or theories, which enable the re-interpretation of the process of financialisation of everyday life"
2021-0180,3,i further analyse the conceptual socialization of these technological endeavours with the wider-reaching theme of accelerating the capitalist process with the objective to overturn its excessive powers
2021-0180,4,"the paper concludes by suggesting that fintech experiments which are socialized with accelerationist narratives re-interpret the process of financialisation as a path of liberation instead of exploitation, offering an escape from the capitalist crisis through machinic alchemy"
2021-0181,0,this paper examines the impact of historical endowment on the initial coin offering (ico) market
2021-0181,1,"leveraging a sample of 1,617 hand collected icos over 2015-2019 and regressions models, we find that a country's legal origin, disease environment, exposure to slave trade, and proximity to ancient trade routes are important determinants of the total amount of capital raised through icos"
2021-0181,2,further analyses suggest that the impact of historical endowment operates through legal and information sharing institutions
2021-0181,3,this finding suggests that traumatic shocks in the history plays an important role in shaping current fintech development through long-run persistence of formal and informal institutions
2021-0181,4,this research highlights the importance to enlarge the scope of fintech research and the importance to take institutions into account in relevant policy designs to promote financial development
2021-0182,0,one of the most modern inventions of financial technology (fintech) since after the global financial crisis of 2008 is the crypto or virtual currency/asset
2021-0182,1,"since the creation of the first cryptocurrency, the bitcoin, in 2009, it is estimated that over five thousand variants of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged"
2021-0182,2,virtual currencies have become widespread across the globe but their legal status and uses in various countries have remained uncertain
2021-0182,3,"they have been variously classified as currencies, securities, properties, assets, commodities and tokens, and used as means of exchange but are not legally recognised as legal tender"
2021-0182,4,"in many jurisdictions their emergence was greeted with scepticism and express or tacit rejection by financial and securities markets regulators, but over time, owing to their increasing popularity, characteristics, positive and negative potentials, there has been a gradual shift towards their formal recognition and regulation"
2021-0182,5,regulatory authorities in many countries are now grappling with designing appropriate policy and regulatory framework for the crypto phenomenon
2021-0182,6,"this paper interrogates the current legal status and efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies in two leading african nations, nigeria and south africa, and highlights the challenges of designing an appropriate regulatory framework for this enigmatic technology"
2021-0182,7,"the paper adopts the doctrinal legal research methodology, employing the descriptive, analytical, and comparative approaches"
2021-0182,8,it follows a structured review and analysis of relevant extant legislation on currencies and securities in the countries to ascertain whether they cover cryptocurrencies
2021-0182,9,it then compares the current position of the law on the subject in the two countries
2021-0182,10,"bearing in mind that it may not be possible to totally ban dealing in cryptocurrencies, the paper concludes that regulation has become imperative"
2021-0182,11,"drawing from the position on the subject in more developed nations, the united states of america (us) and the european union (eu), this paper proposes a model of regulation of virtual currency not only for nigeria and south africa but also for other african countries"
2021-0183,0,"in this paper, we examine the impact of corporate reputation on fintech firms"
2021-0183,1,"using a unique hand-collected dataset of customer complaints, violations, hacks/data breaches, and lawsuits"
2021-0183,2,"we find that markets negatively react to violation announcements, especially for lawsuits"
2021-0183,3,"our findings show that despite their popularity, corporate wrongdoing is skyrocketing and can negatively impact fintech firms"
2021-0183,4,"these findings have implications for fintech management, stakeholders, and investors"
2021-0184,0,"using a panel of 78 countries for 2013  2019, i show that fintech credit platforms can act as both complements and substitutes for traditional bank credit and that banking sector characteristics are likely to play a part in shaping the relationship"
2021-0184,1,"estimates suggest that in less concentrated, more liquid and more stable banking sectors, banks and fintech credit platforms tend not to compete for the same clientele and coexist as complements"
2021-0184,2,"on the other hand, in less stable and highly concentrated banking sectors, i find evidence that fintech may act as a direct substitute to bank credit"
2021-0185,0,financial technology (fintech) is widely recognised as important in addressing financial inclusion
2021-0185,1,"however, limited research theorises how new entrants and incumbents work together in fintech ecosystems to shape financial inclusion"
2021-0185,2,"we undertake a theory-generating case study with multilevel interacting organisations in ghana, where, like many other african countries, the growth in fintech has led to new opportunities for financial inclusion"
2021-0185,3,"we conceptualise three practices, as building blocks at the ecosystem level, through which incumbents and new entrants shape financial inclusion: (1) innovative and collaborative practices, (2) protectionist and equitable practices, and (3) legitimising and sustaining practices"
2021-0185,4,"we articulate a theoretical model that explains how the practices shape financial inclusion and propose three theoretical propositions of how financial inclusion in developing countries is being scaled and shaped in terms of actors, relationships, and practices"
2021-0186,0,we investigate the return and volatility spillovers between a fintech etf and the etfs of the traditional financial industry with an empirical network model
2021-0186,1,"we find that the traditional financial etfs are still the main givers, and the fintech etf is the net receiver"
2021-0186,2,the fintech etf does not lead to greater volatility and financial instability in most of the traditional financial sectors
2021-0186,3,"the information transmission between these etfs is high, especially during the period of us-china trade friction"
2021-0186,4,our results provide a full understanding of the effect of changes in information transmission between fintech and the traditional financial industry
2021-0187,0,artificial intelligence has disrupted the financial services industry
2021-0187,1,"the emerging innovations such as, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and data mining leave no financial institutions across the globe untouched"
2021-0187,2,"these advances have profoundly predisposed several facets of financial markets like investments, transfers, billings, rewards, insurance, remittances, underwriting etc"
2021-0187,3,"fintech companies were the early adopters of these ai powered innovations to promote greater budgetary awareness, human life development, improved decision-making, and more"
2021-0187,4,"this paper explores the growth of fintech in india, its associated challenges, and the opportunities emerging from high penetration, demographic dividend and connectivity to modern and affordable technology, low smartphone rates, and public policies like digital india, make in india, etc"
2021-0187,5,"through uses cases of artificial intelligence, the paper also elaborates how artificial intelligence fosters fintech companies"
2021-0187,6,"lastly, this paper suggests strategies that may help practitioners and researchers to tap the untapped potentials of fintech in india"
2021-0188,0,this article contributes to the discussion about managing the risks and uncertainties of emerging technologies through increased stakeholder participation
2021-0188,1,"authorities have increasingly invited stakeholders from high-technology sectors to participate in assessing the risks of, and designing responses to, new technologies"
2021-0188,2,yet authorities often struggle to attract stakeholders from such sectors to participate
2021-0188,3,a critical challenge identified but still undertheorised in the literature
2021-0188,4,"responding to this gap, this article presents a case study of the uk's regulatory sandbox for financial technologies, applying a document study, questionnaire and interviews to explore fintech firm motivations and apprehensions about participation"
2021-0188,5,"drawing on the bureaucratic reputation literature, the study finds that fintech firms have a range of practical, reputational and normative motivations to participate, and these motivations are inextricably tied to the regulator's strong reputation with the sector as procedurally correct, high-performing and morally committed to facilitating innovation"
2021-0188,6,"on this basis, recommendations for practitioners and hypotheses for future research into the drivers of stakeholder participation in regulatory decision-making surrounding emerging technologies are proposed"
2021-0189,0,the huge advancement in the field of communication has pushed the innovation pace towards a new concept in the context of internet of things (iot) named iot for financial technology applications (iot-fintech)
2021-0189,1,the main intention is to leverage the businesses&#x2019
2021-0189,2,income and reducing cost by facilitating the benefits enabled by iot-fintech technology
2021-0189,3,"to do so, some of the challenging problems that mainly related to routing protocols in such highly dynamic, unreliable (due to mobility) and widely distributed network need to be carefully addressed"
2021-0189,4,this paper therefore focuses on developing a new trustworthy and efficient routing mechanism to be used in routing data traffic over iot-fintech mobile networks
2021-0189,5,a new non-linear l&#x00e9;vy brownian generalized normal distribution optimization (nlbgndo) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of finding an optimal path from source to destination sensor nodes to be used in forwarding fintech&#x2019;s related data
2021-0189,6,we also propose an objective function to be used in maintaining trustworthiness of the selected relay-node candidates by introducing a trust-based friendship mechanism to be measured and applied during each selection process
2021-0189,7,"the formulated model also considering node&#x2019;s residual energy, experienced response time, and inter-node distance (to figure out density/sparsity ratio of sensor nodes)"
2021-0189,8,results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism could maintain very wise and efficient decisions over the selection period in comparison with other methods
2021-0189,9,iee
2021-0190,0,this study took online lending as the main research object to quantitatively measure fintech risk in china
2021-0190,1,a theoretical model was built to analyse the relationship between the assets and liabilities of peer-to-peer platforms and the risk of the entire online lending industry
2021-0190,2,the conditional value at risk method was used to measure the risk spillover effect of the online lending industry and the different types of platforms
2021-0190,3,index smoothing and moving average were used to examine risk contagion
2021-0190,4,"when the risk rate of the portfolio of the platform generally increases, the systemic risk of the whole industry also increases, and if the systemic risk of the industry spreads to the portfolio of the platform, it could affect the stability of the capital flow of the platform, and then affect the risk expectation of the platform itself"
2021-0190,5,most platforms with risk concerns were private
2021-0190,6,banking platforms and public platforms were greatly affected by market risk
2021-0190,7,"however, their own risks had relatively little impact on the overall market"
2021-0190,8,"the greater the market risk, the more platforms become risk platforms, and the smaller the impact on transition platforms"
2021-0190,9,regulatory sandboxes may be an effective means of preventing and controlling fintech risks
2021-0191,0,"fintech is rapidly changing the financial landscape, especially in the post-covid era"
2021-0191,1,"this study uses data from the world's first global ranking of fintech ecosystems, the global fintech index (gfi), to investigate the linkages between fintech development and demand for savings, borrowing, and remittances for 16 of the world's largest emerging economies"
2021-0191,2,our results find a consistently strong and positive relationship between fintech development and financial inclusion
2021-0191,3,"however, considerable heterogeneities persist across population groups and regions"
2021-0191,4,evidence also suggests that access may not translate to greater usage of financial services
2021-0191,5,the findings have important implications for future models of financial inclusion looking to harness the power of fintech
2021-0192,0,a finance company is a form of company that takes advantage of technological developments by creating fintech- applications to improve service quality
2021-0192,1,"in 2019, the customer service queue at xyz company (pt xyz) reached 350 queues per month"
2021-0192,2,"meanwhile, the cashier queues to make payments an average of 3800 per month"
2021-0192,3,"the high level of queues, can certainly have an impact on office effectiveness and efficiency"
2021-0192,4,"this study aims to analyze what constraints have caused the low number of fintech payment application users, how to map potential and non-potential customers usage of fintech applications"
2021-0192,5,"the results showed that the problem with the low use of the fintech payment application was because 60% of customers did not know the application, 40% of customers did not have a bank account so they could not make transactions on the fintech payment application and 67% of customers chose payment media through outlets / minimarkets even though they had to pay a fee"
2021-0192,6,"to determine the effectiveness of using the application, a tam (technology acceptance model) is used which consists of trust, value for profit, convenience, social influence and intention to use"
2021-0193,0,"in todays financial services landscape, staying ahead of the innovation curve and being disciplined at enhancing core service offerings entail careful resource planning"
2021-0193,1,a well-structured outsourcing arrangement can go a long way towards enhancing long term organizational strategic growth
2021-0193,2,"in the post-2014 fintech era, (i) strategic management with an innovation focus and (ii) financial technology-associated risks, have brought about changes to outsourcing in the financial services industry"
2021-0193,3,"presently, most outsourcing life cycle models in existing literature seek to provide comprehensive, yet industry-neutral guidelines lacking industry context and depth of coverage"
2021-0193,4,"a newly licensed financial institution deciding to embark on outsourcing but is uncertain about how to thread the increasingly complex fintech and financial regulatory landscape, will likely find domain-specific outsourcing life cycle models useful"
2021-0193,5,"a more targeted financial services outsourcing life cycle approach, with a focus on strategy and risk management in todays context, can contribute more effectively to the application and review of outsourcing implementation"
2021-0193,6,this research contributes to present literature by proposing a new strategy-risk outsourcing life cycle model
2021-0193,7,this is an elegant and simple-to-use end-to-end framework which can be utilized by the financial services industry to guide outsourcing decisions
2021-0193,8,the paper also recommends areas for future research

2021-0195,4,"it finds that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, safety and trust are the main factors that affect the adoption of mobile payments, and mobile-payment providers need to improve technical protection and offer some benefits to boost the mobile-payment business"
2021-0195,5,the covid-19 outbreak has caused the decline of cash payments and the increase of contactless payments in the netherlands
2021-0195,6,mobile payments ensure peoples health and help slow down the spread of the virus
2021-0082,0,this study explores bank screening incentives under credit market competition between traditional banks and a fintech startup
2021-0082,1,"the bank screening incentives increase with the cost of the fintech startups screening technology, decrease with the performance of that technology, and increase with the cost of entrepreneurs conveying information to the fintech startup"
2021-0082,2,"however, when the preparation cost of entrepreneurs applying to the banks for loans falls with fintech, the bank screening incentives are eroded"
2021-0082,3,"while when the bank screening cost decreases with fintech, those incentives are enhanced"
2021-0082,4,we also discuss the role of capital regulation and several extensions for robustness

2021-0200,2,"to cope with this challenge, we propose a prediction framework based on an adversarial training strategy using reinforcement learning for the said fintech application"
2021-0200,3,"the framework uses a heterogeneous knowledge-base including stock prices, tweets, and global indicators"
2021-0200,4,we propose a modified newton-divided difference polynomial (nddp) for missing data imputation
2021-0200,5,the informative patterns representing the intrinsic characteristics of financial markets were extracted using long short-term memory networks (lstm)
2021-0200,6,the two adversarial networks are heterogeneous data fusion representing market crash (hdfm) q-learning and confrontational q-learning network
2021-0200,7,both networks are trained in an adversarial fashion to increase the effectiveness of prediction even when the financial market is volatile
2021-0200,8,the experimental results show the importance of global indicators and the proposed adversarial learning network (aln) for improving the predictive performance in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art works

2021-0209,1,"the periodization of the banking system from 2005 to the present in accordance with the strategic development goals and stages of the bank's life cycle has allowed to justify the relevant digitalization policy, appropriate for each period"
2021-0209,2,it has been proved that the symbiosis of banks and fintech companies helps to increase the competitiveness and profitability of business in the long run
2021-0209,3,"the importance of introduction of banking innovations in the crediting market as the most profitable direction of banking activity has been substantiated, the forecast of change in net interest income of ukrainian banks for the post-pandemic period has been made"

2021-0209,5,the main factors that inhibit the processes of strengthening the interaction between banks and fintech companies in ukraine have been identified
2021-0209,6,the expediency of improving the current legislation of ukraine taking into account the best european practices in the field of cooperation between banks and fintech companies has been substantiated
2021-0210,0,"buy-now-pay-later (bnpl) arrangements have rapidly emerged as a short-term debt option, and like other innovative and disruptive fintech, challenge existing regulation"
2021-0210,1,"bnpl arrangements avoided prescribed responsible lending legislative obligations, which applied to similar short-term credit products"
2021-0210,2,"instead, bnpl relies on responsible spending in providing a potentially cheaper option than alternatives such as credit cards"
2021-0210,3,we describe the interplay of regulation and responsibility with bnpl
2021-0210,4,a survey investigates whether a key demographic (young adults) have an appetite or skill for responsible use
2021-0210,5,we analyse the preference for bnpl relative to credit cards and the role of financial literacy and traits including propensity to plan and save
2021-0210,6,the findings suggest that financial literacy reduces perceived bnpl benefits and that lower financial literacy is associated with more benefits and less risks

2021-0211,0,"research shows that black, latinx, and other minorities pay more for credit and banking services, and that wealth accumulation differs starkly between their households and white households"
2021-0211,1,"the link between debt in-equality and the wealth gap, however, remains less thoroughly explored, particularly in light of new credit products and debt-like banking services, such as early wage access and other fintech innovations"
2021-0211,2,these innovations both hold the promise of reducing racial and ethnic disparities in lending and bring concerns that they may be exploited in ways that perpetuate ine-quality
2021-0211,3,"they also come at a time when policy makers are considering how to help communities of color rebuild their wealth, presenting an opportunity to critique policy proposals"
2021-0211,4,"this article leverages that opportunity by syn-thesizing research about the long-term costs of debt inequality on commu-nities of color, adding an in-depth analysis of several new advances in banking and lending, and proposing several key principles for reducing debt inequality as an input to the wealth gap"
2021-0212,0,fixed-income corporate bond markets were the last bastion of non-electronic trading activity
2021-0212,1,for most of the twentieth century these markets were also dominated by the largest wall street dealer-banks
2021-0212,2,these banks had long argued that corporate bonds were too complex and illiquid to be electronified
2021-0212,3,"in reality though, opaque over-the-counter trading in these bonds allowed wall street to monopolise highly uncompetitive markets"
2021-0212,4,"this market environment had changed very little over the decades, despite the financial services revolutions that had gripped other markets"
2021-0212,5,"by the 2010s however, wall street banks had finally begun to lose their stranglehold"
2021-0212,6,"this paper tracks the two explanatory factors, the emergence of new financial technology and the decisive intervention of state managers and post-crisis regulationin the form of the volcker rule and basel iii"
2021-0212,7,"recent accounts have become increasingly sceptical of the disruptive, pro-competitive impact of fintech"
2021-0212,8,"we argue thatat least in markets for us corporate bondsthere is evidence of a more competitive, democratic market environment emerging as a direct result of new financial technologies"
2021-0213,0,this chapter argues that developments in exchange-traded funds (etfs) and fintech markets mark a qualitative shift in the function and interpretation of information
2021-0213,1,"whilst trading becomes quicker, nimbler and more voluminous under passive investment strategies augmented by automation, the role of information also changes in subtle ways"
2021-0213,2,"in particular, under these conditions, financial market prices will become increasingly self-referential"
2021-0213,3,"that is to say, investors in markets will no longer make investment decisions based upon information gathered by themselves or others - a hallmark of the efficient markets hypothesis (emh) - but through acting on the trading of a smaller group of active traders"
2021-0213,4,misinformed trades by active traders in the markets may not be countered by other informed investors
2021-0213,5,"rather, they would trigger more misinformed automated trades"
2021-0213,6,"these trading developments may undermine the price formation mechanism, especially if the composition of views amongst informed traders is skewed by behavioural biases in a particular direction"
2021-0213,7,"importantly, the disruptive impact of certain automated trading reduces the incentive for information gathering, as these algorithmically driven vehicles free-ride on research by active traders and use their resources and speed to front-run their trades"
2021-0213,8,"one effect of these developments is a reduction in the informativeness of financial market pricing, which, if persistent enough, may cause systemic instability"
2021-0214,0,"while regulation of financial intermediaries has been embraced because the industry is particularly prone to market failures, disintermediation has the potential to make current frameworks obsolete"
2021-0214,1,"the law and economics problem is twofold: (1) potential market failures, and (2) the issue of enforcement"
2021-0214,2,this chapter discusses the foundations of financial intermediation and the traditional regulatory approaches to both banks and other providers of financial services
2021-0214,3,our analysis establishes a distinction between fintechs working outside and inside the blockchain
2021-0214,4,"for the former, the crucial regulatory trade-off is between efficiency gains from innovation and regulatory arbitrage"
2021-0214,5,"for the latter, our analysis suggests that regulating the convertibility of cryptocurrencies into fiat money is a promising strategy not only to safeguard financial stability, but also to attract financial services to the regulatory perimeter, whenever it is efficient to do so"
2021-0215,0,"sustainable development is one of the most important shared objectives globally, and today increasingly centres on the united nations sustainable development goals (un sdgs)"

2021-0215,4,"it enables people to manage their financial obligations efficiently, reduces poverty and supports wider economic growth"
2021-0215,5,"financial inclusion, and especially access to credit, therefore introduces individuals to a new array of financial risks"
2021-0215,6,digital finance and fintech play three core roles in relation to achieving the sdgs
2021-0216,0,"the provision of credit through online lending platforms, also known as fintech credit, is an expression of a process of innovation that has increasingly affected the financial services industry since the recent financial crisis"
2021-0216,1,"the fintech credit market is innovative in that, through web-based platforms, it offers borrowers and lenders cash opportunities and the possibility of gaining interest rates outside mainstream financial services providers"
2021-0216,2,this chapter provides an account of the growth of the fintech credit industry since its rise in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis
2021-0216,3,"in so doing, it reviews the evolution of some lending platforms from disintermediated to re-intermediated actors, and the implications of this process for their co-existence with traditional intermediaries in the financial services domain"
2021-0216,4,"by also focusing on the current covid-19 pandemic crisis, we consider the platforms view of their growth as a possibility of standing on equal footing with traditional financial intermediaries and the regulator view (particularly in the uk) of fintech credit as a business model that still needs to gain trust to be recognised as a valid alternative to others"
2021-0217,0,this chapter explores the analytical lens beyond the common preoccupation with the piecemeal revision of specific legal rules that do not map neatly onto fintech developments
2021-0217,1,"it argues that fintech is a fundamentally systemic regulatory challenge, a macro-level force disrupting the currently dominant technocratic paradigm of modern financial regulation"
2021-0217,2,the chapter discusses the inherent inability of the existing technocratic regulatory model to accommodate these systemic changes and outlines the core changes in the underlying philosophy of financial regulation necessary in order to meet the fintech challenge
2021-0217,3,a sustained inquiry into the systemic meaning and impact of fintech as a regulatory phenomenon must start with an analysis of the defining features of the current system of financial regulation
2021-0217,4,fintech is fundamentally changing the way financial services are delivered and transactions are conducted
2021-0217,5,fintech innovations are also broadening the menu of financial services and products
2021-0218,0,"this chapter examines the digitisation, disintermediation and datafication of consumer credit markets - a phenomenon described as fintech credit - and the implications of this phenomenon for the functioning and regulation of consumer credit markets, focusing on the challenges for consumer financial protection"
2021-0083,0,we analyze lending by traditional as well as fintech lenders during covid-19
2021-0083,1,"comparing samples of fintech and bank loan records across the outbreak, we find that fintech companies are more likely to expand credit access to new and financially constrained borrowers after the start of the pandemic"
2021-0083,2,"however, this increased credit provision may not be sustainable"
2021-0083,3,"the delinquency rate of fintech loans triples after the outbreak, but there is no significant change in the delinquency of bank loans"
2021-0083,4,borrowers holding both loan types prioritize the payment of bank loans
2021-0083,5,these results shed light on the benefits provided by shadow banking in a crisis and hint at the potential fragility of such institutions when delinquency rates spike
2021-0219,0,"the use of technology in the financial sector has deeply transformed business models, products and services, and is affecting regulation and supervision"
2021-0219,1,"after focusing on the main current trends in fintech regulation within the eu, and on the related phenomenon of regtech, this chapter aims to explore the recent developments in suptech and to assess how the employment of technology-enabled solutions is changing the way authorities perform their functions"
2021-0219,2,"the spread of suptech could enhance supervisory capabilities while fostering a more flexible and collaborative approach towards the regulated institutions, representing a paradigm shift in the relationship between regulation and supervision"
2021-0219,3,these changes pose new challenges to the current institutional framework and to the underlying public law accountability principles
2021-0084,0,advances in information and communication technology (ict) have provided a platform for the introduction and diffusion of a range of financial technologies that have transformed the financial sector
2021-0084,1,this study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (fintech) and its interaction with financial inclusion and living standards (gdp per capita)
2021-0084,2,we consider the determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to gdp per capitaa fintech diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel
2021-0084,3,we specify the interactions between these two channels and their relationship with income per capita
2021-0084,4,our empirical analysis focuses on the diffusion of two enabling fintech innovations: atms and associated digital networks
2021-0084,5,and mobile phones and payments systems
2021-0084,6,"the relationships between fintech diffusion, financial inclusion and gdp per capita are estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 19912015 using both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that distinguishes short- and long-run effects"
2021-0084,7,a key finding is that fintech diffusion and financial inclusion have long-run effects on gdp per capita over and above their short-run impact and the effects of investment in fixed and human capital
2021-0220,0,one of the basic tenets when assessing consumer behavior is the issue that consumers are not all equal
2021-0220,1,consumers have different sets of needs and problems to solve and fintech start-ups need to identify all relevant types of consumers since a one-size-fits-all approach may not be enough to appeal to heterogeneous customers needs and problems
2021-0220,2,"this chapter analyzes the antecedents to consumers differences and advances a managerial framework not only to identify different consumers segments, but also to target relevant segments and position the fintech value proposition through targeted market strategies that attract, retain, and develop customers"
2021-0221,0,this chapter analyzes traditional and new modes of competition from the incumbents and new entrants standpoints
2021-0221,1,"up to 2008, the financial industry was considered oligopolistic in nature, but instead of the strong market power of some players, relationship among many financial players is of paramount importance for industry competition"
2021-0221,2,"this chapter shows how new fintech start-ups have managed to encroach the market, how established companies have reacted, and the subsequent strategic moves by all players oriented to implement market growth strategies"
2021-0221,3,"based on this perspective, the chapter offers a managerial framework to assess the ways big and small companies can choose and implement entry and growth strategies in fintech markets"
2021-0222,0,technology is a critical factor that leads to higher performance and sustainable competitive advantage
2021-0222,1,"however, technology alone is unable to accomplish such an objective"
2021-0222,2,"instead, scarce resources and capabilities across the organization are the foundation to develop a sustainable competitive advantage in the form of brand equity, value offering, and customer relationships"
2021-0222,3,this chapter discusses an overarching framework to assess how technologies as unique resources can help exploit opportunities to achieve sustainable competitive advantages
2021-0222,4,the vrio framework enables managers to assess a number of dimensions of resources that make them unique to better positioning in the marketplace
2021-0222,5,"this chapter discusses how firms can develop dynamic capabilities to sense, seize, and take advantage of market and technology opportunities along with a survey of suitable technologies for fintech"
2021-0223,0,"this chapter introduces fintech as an ecosystem that exists at the intersection of entrepreneurship, finance, and technology"
2021-0223,1,"as a new industry that started as a consequence of the financial crisis in 2008, fintech started by addressing unattended market segments to encroach the financial industry"
2021-0223,2,"while the financial industry is still dominated by big corporations and as fintech small companies started to grow, the competitive dynamics has changed to reflect issues of competition and collaboration"
2021-0223,3,an entrepreneurial mindset has been therefore critical to innovation of financial products
2021-0223,4,"while many technologies amenable to fintech entrepreneurs abound, more relevant is how these technologies deliver value to financial consumers"
2021-0223,5,actors in the fintech ecosystem go beyond the traditional supplierconsumer relationship and a new full line of fintech products is available
2021-0224,0,"the previous chapters have discussed several issues of financial companiesincumbents and startups, as well as topics on financial consumers and customers"
2021-0224,1,"whether the fintech can be considered an incremental or radical innovation, the implications are clear in that a complete industry has mutated after the financial crisis of 2008 that permeated many countries around the world"
2021-0224,2,this crisis was the first symptom of the wider impact of fintech on the society at large
2021-0224,3,"by broadening the perspective beyond the business realm, this chapter analyzes the impact of the fintech ecosystem on societal issues"
2021-0224,4,challenges and pending issues to address are also discussed to understand critical understanding of the financial problems that arise and managers can pose and provide contributions to society
2021-0225,0,this chapter introduces the fundamental pillars of innovation to frame product development
2021-0225,1,"fintech innovative financial products, services, and business models have been enabled not only by recent technologies and innovation methodologies"
2021-0225,2,"innovation is a broad term to refer to new products and this chapter discusses taxonomy as an aid to managers to conceptualize and map products in the market, given that each type of innovation calls for a different business model"
2021-0225,3,concepts of incremental and radical innovations and contemporary frameworks of open innovation are discussed
2021-0225,4,entrepreneurial innovation is a source of innovation in fintech traditional players in the financial industry to streamline the entrepreneurial stages of exploration and exploitation of opportunities
2021-0225,5,"finally, a valuation model to frame a fintech start-up as a financial option is presented"
2021-0226,0,"with american families living on the financial edge and seeking out high-cost loans even before covid-19, the term financial technology or fintech has been used like an incantation aimed at remedying everything thats wrong with americas financial system"
2021-0226,1,scholars and supporters from both the public and private sector proclaim that innovations in financial technology will bank the unbanked and open new channels to affordable credit
2021-0226,2,"this exuberance for all things tech in finance has led to a quiet yet aggressive deregulatory agenda, including, as of late, a federal assault via rulemaking on the ability of states to police the cost and privilege of extending credit within their borders"
2021-0226,3,"this deregulation and the ethos behind it have made space for growth in high-cost, predatory lending that reaches across state lines via websites and smart phones and aggressively targets cash-strapped families"
2021-0226,4,these loans are made using a business model whereby funds are funneled through a group of lightly regulated banks in a way designed to take advantage of federal preemption
2021-0226,5,"fintech companies rent out and profit from the special legal status of these bank partners, which in turn keeps the banks involvement in the shadows"
2021-0226,6,"stripping down predatory fintechs practices and showing them for what they really are, this article situates fintech in the context of this countrys longstanding dual banking wars, both between states and the federal government and between consumer advocates and banking regulators"
2021-0226,7,and it points the way forward for scholars and regulators willing to shake off fintechs hypnotic effect
2021-0226,8,"this means, in the short term, using existing regulatory tools to curtail the dangerous lending identified here, including by taking a more expansive view of what it means for a bank to operate safely and soundly under the law"
2021-0226,9,"in the long term, it means having a more comprehensive and national discussion about how we regulate household credit in the digital age, specifically through the convening of a twenty-first century commission on consumer finance"
2021-0226,10,the article explains how and why the time is ripe to do both
2021-0226,11,"as the current pandemic wipes out wages and decimates savings, leaving desperate families turning to predatory fintech finance ever more, the need for reform has never been greater"
2021-0227,0,"this chapter wraps up features of fintech industryits products, services, strategies, and consumers and introduces a framework to conceptualize how fintech will evolve in the future"
2021-0227,1,"scenario planning has been the standard planning tool to prospect changes in markets, industries, and social dimensions of life"
2021-0227,2,"while this prospective technique is useful to foresee long-term changes, the heterogeneous social and technical features of fintech require a broader framework to encompass all participants, processes and routines, technological devices, and their complex web of interrelationships to provide managers with a broad picture on how all these components interact in layers of diffuse borders and cross-border flows of knowledge"
2021-0227,3,"drawing on the theory of assemblage, a prospective framework is advanced and applied to fintech to gain insights on long-term changes"
2021-0228,0,this paper explores possible responses to some of the main challenges associated with conducting elite and expert interviews as part of qualitative research in human geography
2021-0228,1,"drawing on the example of the dynamic fintech industry, the paper outlines some similarities and differences between elite and expert interviews and uses this to identify and discuss possible responses"
2021-0228,2,"against this backdrop, the paper also reflects on advantages and disadvantages of using the professional social networking site linkedin as a research aid for sampling and contacting interviewees as well as for interview preparation"
2021-0228,3,the paper is anticipated to be of interest to those conducting qualitative research involving limited size sample subjects who are potentially difficult to find
2021-0228,4,"the information, practices and views in this article are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the royal geographical society (with ibg)"
2021-0024,0,the purpose of this research is to define the level of significance for various indicators that influence the degree of consumer satisfaction regarding the use of fintech technologies and services
2021-0024,1,"the most important factors that influence the level of satisfaction when using fintech services were considered: comfort and ease of use, legal regulations, ease of account opening, mobile payments features, crowdfunding options, international money transfers features, reduced costs associated with transactions, peer-to-peer lending, insurances options, online brokerage, cryptocoins options and exchange options"
2021-0024,2,"the study was conducted on a sample of 162 respondents, persons belonging to the millennials and generation z generations"
2021-0024,3,the values of the indicators for different categories of users of fintech services and different categories of generations can be determined based on the statistical tests performed and the results obtained from the regression analysis
2021-0024,4,the values of the indicators are the basic elements for determining the regression model that will help the fintech service vendors to make personalized decisions for each category of users so that the level of customer satisfaction is maximized
2021-0024,5,"the study carried out within the present article is the first of its kind for romania, because up to this moment in the specialized literature there are no such studies for eastern europe"
2021-0024,6,the research we conducted aims to fill the gap existing in the literature and responds to the expectations and needs of stakeholders in the fintechs business area
2021-0024,7,the results of the article are relevant to both stakeholders and the scientific community that is concerned about the impact of fintech technologies
2021-0229,0,healthcare organizations are setting new targets of sustainable practices to improve their financial performance without depleting social and natural capital
2021-0229,1,"maintaining a sustainable, resilient, and durable healthcare system facilitate economies to achieve sustainable competitiveness"
2021-0229,2,"thus, it is important to address and fill the knowledge gap by identifying factors that improve a firms sustainability"
2021-0229,3,"drawing on technological knowledge spillover theory, this study investigates the effect of fintech development on the sustainable performance of healthcare firms using panel data comprised of 11 asia-pacific countries"
2021-0229,4,"by applying the 2-step gmm technique, we find a robust estimate that digital financial technologies improve the sustainable performance of the firms"
2021-0229,5,"contrary to the substitution effect, our results further indicate that financial institutions are collaborating with fintechs to facilitate financing at the individual and firm-level"
2021-0229,6,we also find that financial and ict development positively moderates the relationship between fintech development and sustainable performance
2021-0230,0,"the aim of this paper is to review previous research on fintech, which may be broadly understood as financial innovation that uses information technology to provide financial services"
2021-0230,1,the paper describes a review of 88 refereed academic papers on the subject of fintech published in journals that have high sjr2017 scores
2021-0230,2,papers were categorised according to the type of companies leveraging fintech (existing financial institutions vs
2021-0230,3,new entrants) and the type of value derived from fintech innovation (new value-added vs
2021-0230,4,improved efficiency)
2021-0230,5,"also considered were types of new value-added, geographical focus of the research and research methodologies"
2021-0230,6,the largest number of studies concerned the use of fintech innovation by new entrants to offer solutions to social issues or build new financial ecosystems
2021-0230,7,"over half the studies were on fintech in asia or the european union, and the most common methodology employed was the case study"

2021-0231,0,this paper investigates the effect of banks' investment in fintech firms (ftf) on stock returns
2021-0231,1,"we hand-collect data on 581 investment rounds made by ftfs, within at least one european or north american bank acting as investor"
2021-0231,2,our results show that banks investment in fintech affect stock markets
2021-0231,3,"the abnormal reaction is negative, larger for young and technology-oriented firms, and stronger in the case of multiple investments"
2021-0231,4,"bank size, leverage and profitability do not moderate abnormal returns"
2021-0231,5,"overall, our study suggests that bank equity investment in ftfs is an important determinant of abnormal stock returns"
2021-0232,0,the fintech index has been more active in the stock market with the fintech industry expanding
2021-0232,1,the prediction of the fintech index is significant as it is capable of instructing investors to avoid risks and provide guidance for financial regulators
2021-0232,2,traditional prediction methods adopt the deep neural network (dnn) or the combination of genetic algorithm (ga) and dnn mostly
2021-0232,3,"however, heavy computational load is required by these algorithms"
2021-0232,4,"in this paper, we propose an integrated artificial intelligence-based algorithm, consisting of the random frog algorithm (rf), ga, and dnn, to predict the fintech index"
2021-0232,5,the proposed rf-ga-dnn prediction algorithm filters the key input variables and optimizes the hyperparameters of dnn
2021-0232,6,we compare the proposed rf-ga-dnn with the traditional ga-dnn in terms of convergence time and prediction accuracy
2021-0232,7,results show that the convergence time of ga-dnn is up to 20 hours and its prediction accuracy is 97.4%
2021-0232,8,"in comparison, the convergence time of our rf-ga-dnn is only about 1.5 hours and the prediction accuracy reaches 97.0%"
2021-0232,9,these results demonstrate that the proposed rf-ga-dnn prediction algorithm significantly reduces the convergence time with the promise of competitive prediction accuracy
2021-0232,10,"thus, the proposed algorithm deserves to be widely recommended for predicting the fintech index"

2021-0085,1,fair-lending law prohibits lenders from making credit determinations that disparately affect minority borrowers if those determinations are based on characteristics unrelated to creditworthiness
2021-0085,2,"using an identification under this rule, we show risk-equivalent latinx/black borrowers pay significantly higher interest rates on gse-securitized and fha-insured loans, particularly in high-minority-share neighborhoods"
2021-0085,3,we estimate these rate differences cost minority borrowers over $450 million yearly
2021-0085,4,"fintech lenders rate disparities were similar to those of non-fintech lenders for gse mortgages, but lower for fha mortgages issued in 20092015 and for fha refi mortgages issued in 20182019"
2021-0233,0,"fintech is an active area of innovation and a rapidly growing sector of the economy, yet relatively little is known about how information technology contributes to innovation in fintech"
2021-0233,1,we draw on the business model canvas framework and we examine the role of information technology in the business models of leading european fintech startups
2021-0233,2,"we find that information technology plays a key role across nearly all components of the fintech business models that we reviewed, orchestrating resources and processes to efficiently deliver personalized financial services to customers"
2021-0233,3,"focusing on the it-enabled value propositions across the fintech startups in our sample, we find that the startups tend to emphasize low-cost offerings that may pose a threat to incumbent business models in financial services"
2021-0234,0,"building on critical approaches that understand algorithms in terms of communication, culture and organization, this paper offers the supplementary conceptualization of algorithms as organizational figuration, defined as material and meaningful sociotechnical arrangements that develop in spatiotemporal processes and are shaped by multiple enactments of affordanceagency relations"
2021-0234,1,we develop this conceptualization through a case study of a danish fintech start-up that uses machine learning to create opportunities for sustainable pensions investments
2021-0234,2,"by way of ethnographic and literary methodology, we provide an in-depth analysis of the dynamic trajectory in and through which the organization gives shape to and takes shape from its key algorithmic tool, mapping the shifting sociotechnical arrangements of the start-up, from its initial search for a viable business model through the development of the algorithm to the public launch of its product"
2021-0234,3,"on this basis, we argue that conceptualizing algorithms as organizational figuration enables us to detail not only what algorithms do but also what they are"
2021-0066,0,we report the results of a longitudinal intervention with students across five universities in china designed to reduce online consumer debt
2021-0066,1,"we allocate participants to either a financial literacy treatment group, a self-control treatment group, or a zero-touch control group"
2021-0066,2,"our self-control training intervention features detailed tracking of spending and borrowing, budgeting, and introspection about consumption choices"
2021-0066,3,"this intervention reduces online borrowing and delinquency charges, mainly driven by a reduction in entertainment-related spending and borrowing"
2021-0066,4,"in contrast, financial literacy interventions improve test scores but only marginally affect borrowing"
2021-0066,5,our results suggest that cultivating self-regulation and budgeting skills can improve borrowing behavior on e-commerce platforms
2021-0235,0,"purpose: starting from the state-of-the-art of fintech development, this study aims to propose some research propositions comparing reward-crowdfunding (rcf) and equity-crowdfunding (ecf)"
2021-0235,1,"in this sense, the present research provides a comprehensive analysis of fintech development and  to conceptualize the comparison between rcf and ecf  it focuses on campaigns characteristics, aims and post-campaigns scenarios"
2021-0235,2,design/methodology/approach: all the research propositions related to the comparison between rcf and ecf are rooted in dedicated literature
2021-0235,3,the methodological approach adopted in the present paper can be referred to theorizing
2021-0235,4,"findings: this study suggests that five key elements characterize the development of fintech: regulation, infrastructure, technologies, finance and innovations"
2021-0235,5,the research provides nine propositions: four related to the campaigns characteristics
2021-0235,6,two related to the use of crowdfunding models by entrepreneurs
2021-0235,7,and three related to the performance of crowdfunded companies
2021-0235,8,"practical implications: by offering nine research propositions, this study is expected to foster and support the investigation of fintech development from an entrepreneurial and managerial point of view"
2021-0235,9,"originality/value: to the best of authors knowledge, this study is among the first to explore the fintech development and to propose a comparative approach between rcf and ecf"
2021-0235,10,this research contributes to the current debate on fintech development as well as on the comparison between crowdfunding models
2021-0065,0,fintech innovations are rapidly transforming the global financial industry and easing the financial inclusion initiatives of microfinance institutions (mfis)
2021-0065,1,such technological transformations are expected to promote stability in the financial system and in turn reduce the risk-taking behavior of its main actors
2021-0065,2,"however, there is limited or no empirical evidence to confirm the impact of fintech-based financial inclusion (finfi) on the risk-taking behavior of sub-saharan african mfis"
2021-0065,3,"thus, we have developed a new index to measure finfi and empirically assess its role in reducing the risk-taking attitude of mfis"
2021-0065,4,the validity of our results was confirmed by using various robustness tests
2021-0236,0,financial technology or what is so-called fintech is one of the prominent sectors that have been introduced by the fourth industrial revolution at the beginning of the second millennium
2021-0236,1,"the fintech sector is providing a variety of innovative digitized financial activities in the aims of improving and facilitating traditional financial services as they are often faster, cheaper, easier to access"
2021-0236,2,"the rise and development of fintech sector in todays world is playing a crucial role in increasing the financial inclusion levels among individuals as well as among businesses, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes)"
2021-0236,3,higher financial exclusion has a major negative impact on poverty and income distribution in societies
2021-0236,4,"about 2.5 billion people and over 200 million businesses are still excluded from the formal financial system which is restraining economic growth, job creation and employment opportunities [13]"
2021-0236,5,"similarly, in india, the figures of the unbanked population counted for 190 million adults without a bank account [13]"
2021-0236,6,"for a population size of more than 98 million people, 77% of adults in egypt are not having a formal bank account [30]"
2021-0236,7,the main objective of this study is to understand how the digitization of financial services can play a major role in increasing inclusive growth and entrepreneurship with a special emphasis on the indian and egyptian cases
2021-0236,8,this study is based on a theoretical and conceptual framework
2021-0236,9,"the study examines various archival, reports of national and international organizations"
2021-0236,10,the findings of the study are showing that the fintech sector is having immense opportunities for enhancing entrepreneurship and economic growth in developing countries
2021-0236,11,the fintech sector in egypt is still new but rapidly expanding
2021-0236,12,"in comparison with the successful indian experience, the digital financial ecosystem in egypt is facing a major shortfall"
2021-0237,0,the peer to peer lending financial technology corporation as a digital-based intermediary has two types of agency relationships: (1) between financial technology corporation as an agent with investors as a principal
2021-0237,1,(2) between financial technology corporation as an agent and the small-medium enterprises as a third party (debtors)
2021-0237,2,"both of these agency relationships currently run independently and are separate from other agency relationships, so they are not effective in improving performance"
2021-0237,3,"therefore, the purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual framework of the e-integrated corporate governance model at the peer to peer lending financial technology corporation to improve sustainability performance"
2021-0237,4,"the research method in this article was reviewing articles related to corporate governance, finding gaps and limitations"
2021-0237,5,"the results of this study are that because business processes in financial technology corporations are interconnected systems, both corporate governances must be integrated with information technology, in order to improve sustainability performance"
2021-0237,6,"with this model, asymmetric information between the three parties (depositors/investors, financial technology corporation, and small-medium enterprises) and all stakeholders can be eliminated, risks can be reduced, business processes and financial and non-financial information of the three parties is more transparent and accessible for all stakeholders"
2021-0238,0,"financial technology is one of the fields that has recently appeared in the finance and banking sector, and it has become imperative for the concerned sectors in all countries of the world to keep pace with this development"
2021-0238,1,"while the debate is still going on about financial technology as an intruder, unregulated sector, this study was conducted with the aim of identifying the concept of financial technology, its characteristics, fields, and development and what it has achieved from global investments"
2021-0238,2,"it also aimed to identify the reality of financial technology in the arab world, and the most important emerging projects in this field, available opportunities and challenges"

2021-0249,0,alternative data in small and medium-sized enterprise (sme)-focused fintech lending has been defined as data that are gathered from non-traditional data sources and not typically included in the traditional credit process
2021-0249,1,the use of a broad variety and vast amount of structured and unstructured alternative data to mitigate information friction and augment risk management is at the heart of fintech lending
2021-0249,2,"by categorizing alternative data into different types and comparing them with traditional data, our study seeks to answer the following important questions in sme-focused fintech lending: 1) whether traditional data outperform alternative data in managing the convenience-fraud risk conflict, 2) whether traditional and alternative data are overall complements or substitutes in credit evaluation and fraud detection, and 3) how and to what extent traditional and alternative data should be combined for better credit and loan decisions"
2021-0250,0,this paper studies the impact of a policy of opening the platform's data to banks
2021-0250,1,"this makes banks in a better position to compete with the platform, and some firms benefit from cheaper loans due to increased competition of financial service"
2021-0250,2,"however, our model shows that it might harm the platform ecosystem, and small firms can no longer get loans"

2021-0253,2,"we find that fin-tech lenders have substantially expanded the small business finance market by reaching borrowers less likely to be served by traditional lenders and that businesses using online lenders are younger, smaller, and less profitable than the average small or medium-sized enterprise in the united states"
2021-0253,3,"after con-trolling for compositional differences between online and bank borrowers, we find that businesses using fintech lenders gen-erally apply for smaller loan amounts but value the option of fintech loans"
2021-0253,4,businesses that receive fintech loans expect more revenue and employment growth than those receiving a bank loan
2021-0253,5,"however, they are less satisfied than businesses that borrow from banks but more satisfied than businesses that were denied credit"

2021-0028,2,"to mitigate this challenge, software-defined network (sdn) has been leveraged in the proposed approach to provide scalability and resilience in multi-controller environment"
2021-0028,3,"however, in case if one of these controllers fail or cannot work as per desired requirements, then either the network load of that controller has to be migrated to another suitable controller or it has to be divided or balanced among other available controllers"
2021-0028,4,"for this purpose, the proposed approach provides an adaptive recovery mechanism in a multi-controller sdn setup using support vector machine-based classification approach"
2021-0028,5,"the proposed work defines a recovery pool based on the three vital parameters, reliability, energy, and latency"
2021-0028,6,"a utility matrix is then computed based on these parameters, on the basis of which the recovery controllers are selected"

2021-0257,4,"the startup wave has obsessed the middle east and north africa (mena) region and when it is digital startups, the fintech is closely reaching 12% of all transactions in the region followed by e-commerce [9]"
2021-0257,5,the mena region governments and apex bodies are encouraging fintech industries to develop their businesses along with it innovation to establish a sound financial ecosystem
2021-0257,6,"as said by coo of jordans arab bank, this industry is at an earlier stage which requires lots of rules and policies to regulate this industry with the support of banks and fintech industries"
2021-0257,7,it is the crucial task for the regulators to establish technology based steady financial system which requires well established stringent rules and regulations to prevent cyber-crimes
2021-0257,8,"hence, this conceptual work attempts to understand the main aspects of fintech, role of financial institutions, attitude of stakeholders towards the new financial system, challenges and opportunities prevailing towards this industry"
2021-0257,9,this has been achieved by reviewing the existing literature to support the growth of the economy in mena region using fintech

2021-0044,1,this study aims to highlight the current corporate governance issues which fintech firms are facing
2021-0044,2,"this line of enquiry is necessary as a majority of fintech firms are collaborating with the listed firms, and quality corporate governance is vital to protect the shareholders rights"
2021-0044,3,"fintech governance structure faces four key challenges: lack of anti-misconduct policy, ceo duality, over-boarded directors, and the inability of audit firms to detect fraud"
2021-0044,4,"organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) provides a guideline for corporate governance, suggesting that anti-misconduct policy is a sign of better governance"
2021-0044,5,the agency theory postulates that concentration of power weakens corporate governance mechanism
2021-0044,6,"thereby, ceo duality and over-boarded directors are the indicators of weak governance"
2021-0044,7,"also, the supervisory structure of fintech firms is different than counterparts, which hinder the audit firms to deduct any financial misstatement"
2021-0044,8,"based on the literature, we find that the fintech firms lack anti-bribery policy and prone to have ceo duality, over-boarded directors and audit firms failure to detect fraud"
2021-0044,9,"it implies that the fintech firms have embedded weak governance mechanisms, which will expropriate the shareholders right after the listed firms collaboration"
2021-0044,10,"the governance issues are not merely a technical issue of the fintech firms, as it may cause financial instability across the world"
2021-0258,0,"the growing number of financial technology (fintech) services and its ubiquity is giving great business opportunities not only to banks but also to non-banking financial companies, telecommunication companies and retail companies"

2021-0258,8,behavior intention and usefulness have no significant impact on use
2021-0258,9,security and responsiveness affect the usage but are mediated through ease of use
2021-0259,0,fintech is an emerging paradigm in financial services industry which is becoming the additional source of revenue generation not only for banking companies but also for telecommunication and retail companies
2021-0259,1,"despite the numerous benefits of fintech, its acceptance with users is not as per the industry expectations"
2021-0259,2,this can be attributed to various factors such as lack of trust or responsiveness in available fintech services
2021-0259,3,"the objective of our research is to explore the antecedents of intention to use namely, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use (peu), perceived trust and responsiveness"
2021-0259,4,these factors were empirically assessed by survey of 439 fintech users
2021-0259,5,exploratory factor analysis was done to extract relevant factors
2021-0259,6,structural equation modelling was done to examine model fit and hypotheses testing
2021-0259,7,the analysis shows that usefulness and ease of use have direct effect on intention to use
2021-0259,8,trust and responsiveness have indirect effect on intention to use and is mediated by usefulness and ease of use

2021-0023,0,"despite the potency of financial technology (fintech) in facilitating financial inclusion, the determinants of the diffusion in small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) remain intricate"
2021-0023,1,"consequently, the study assesses the determinants of the diffusion of fintech payment services (mobile money, card, and online payments) by smes in the context of ghana"
2021-0023,2,"we sample 407 registered smes with the association of ghanaian industries (agi) and employ hierarchical logistic regression models to explore the multiplicative effects of smes chief executive officers characteristics (ceoc), business characteristics (busc), and fintech payment service characteristics (fpsc) on the diffusion of fintech payment services (dfps)"
2021-0023,3,"consistent with the technology diffusion theories, the finding reveals that ceoc, busc, and fpsc altogether determines the dfps in ghanaian smes"
2021-0023,4,"thus, the combined effects of human, business, and technology actors drive the dfps in smes"

2021-0000,2,"the results of dy suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses"
2021-0000,3,"second, bitcoin, msciw, msci us, and kftx are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas us dollar, oil, gold, vix, green bond and green bond select are net receivers"
2021-0000,4,"therefore, fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio"
2021-0000,5,"third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term"
2021-0000,6,"that is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility"
2021-0000,7,"fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to fintech, kftx are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%"

2021-0018,0,this paper empirically tests the effect of fintech development on bank risk taking using unbalanced bank-level panel data from china for the period from 2011 to 2018
2021-0018,1,we use the media's attention paid to fintech-related information to gauge fintech development
2021-0018,2,we find robust evidence that the development of fintech exacerbates banks risk taking in general
2021-0018,3,"the heterogeneity analysis further indicates that the asset quality deterioration effect brought about by prosperous fintech is more salient in banks with larger sizes, lower efficiency, more shadow banking business and more interest-based income"
2021-0018,4,"moreover, the nexus between fintech and banks risk taking is a u-shaped trend, with fintech initially intensifying and then weakening banks risk taking"
2021-0018,5,"moreover, the banks responses regarding the u-shaped effect are heterogeneous among different ownership structures"
2021-0018,6,"the responses by state- and jointly owned banks are not notable, while those of city banks, foreign banks and rural banks are more sensitive"
2021-0268,0,consolidation in banking raise concerns about exclusion and predatory practices in small-business lending
2021-0268,1,"fintech lenders, largely unregulated credit providers with lending decisions and loan terms determined primarily by algorithm, have rapidly increased their lending to small businesses"
2021-0268,2,i analyze loan-level data on consumer and small business loans from fintech lenders and a comparison sample of small-business loans from regulated bank lenders
2021-0268,3,fintech small-business loans charge average annual interest rates 3 percentage points higher than consumer loans from the same lender and 4 to 7 percentage points higher than small business loans from regulated banking entities
2021-0268,4,the large interest-rate premium points to the need for regulatory clarity and additional supervision to protect this crucial market segment from predatory non-bank lenders

2021-0001,2,"through experimentation with the platform business model and building on the digital infrastructures and data flows of the broader platform ecosystem, a constellation of organisationsincluding start-ups, early-career firms, bigtech companies and incumbent banksare engaged in processes of platform reintermediation"
2021-0001,3,"changing the bases of competition in retail money and financial markets and encouraging oligopoly and even monopoly, the reintermediation processes of fintech are presently manifest in strong tendencies towards platform consolidation"
2021-0001,4,"the imagined potential of fintech has also triggered intensive processes of capitalisation, with platforms receiving significant prospective investment by venture capital, private equity funds, banks and bigtech firms"

2020-0102,1,findings: adoption of fintech innovations is essential for customer retention
2020-0102,2,practical implications: many large b2c players are moving strongly ahead with adopting fintech driven payment solutions
2020-0102,3,"competitors which ignore this trend, stand to lose customers in the long run"
2020-0102,4,originality/value: fintech is a new and developing industry
2020-0102,5,there has been limited research into its usage by non-financial corporates and impact on customer retention
2020-0140,0,this paper primarily focused on the concept and correlation between the trust mechanism and currency system iterations from the early civilization age till nowadays
2020-0140,1,"structured as starting from diving into the history and evolution of the ""format of the money"", by illustrating the changes associated with ""trust""and ""convenience""as a timeline, and finally research into the ultimate of the current money - bitcoin and cryptocurrency"
2020-0141,0,advancements in technology have resulted in the emergence of numerous fintech innovations
2020-0141,1,"however, a global understanding of such innovations is limited, due to a lack of an underlying taxonomy and benchmark datasets in the fintech domain"
2020-0141,2,"to address this limitation, we develop a fintech taxonomy and manually annotate a set of fintech patent abstracts according to the taxonomy"
2020-0141,3,"we use the annotated dataset to train deep learning models, specifically recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks combined with state-of-the-art bert transformers"
2020-0141,4,experimental results show that the deep learning models can accurately identify fintech innovations
2020-0141,5,"we use our best performing bert-based model on a large dataset of financial patent abstracts, and shortlist a set of 25,580 fintech patent applications submitted to the european and us patent offices between 2000 and 2017"
2020-0141,6,"we illustrate how an analysis of the shortlisted set can be used to gain understanding of what fintech innovations are, where and when they emerge, and provide the basis for further work on what their impact is on the companies investing in them, and ultimately on society"
2020-0041,0,"purpose: considering the ubiquity of fintech services, the study proposes a research framework to examine fintech adoption and use from the technology acceptance perspective by adding sub-constructs of technology acceptance model (tam), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut), servperf and webqual 4.0"
2020-0041,1,"this study broadly classified these sub-constructs in three dimensions: adoption, behavior and technological and explores the relationship between these attributes"
2020-0041,2,it also proposes that digital behavior (internet experience and level of awareness) and demographic characteristics (age and gender) moderate the main relationships
2020-0041,3,design/methodology/approach: the measurement scale for the study is developed through iterative discussion with domain experts
2020-0041,4,the data are collected from 439 active internet users though a digital survey and analysis were done by applying structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis
2020-0041,5,"findings: perceived usefulness and social influence are found to be the key determinant for behavior intention to use fintech services, with social influence having significant negative influence"
2020-0041,6,actual use is significantly influenced by ease of use and social influence but is not determined by behavior intention and perceived usefulness
2020-0041,7,behavioral attributes are significantly impacted by technological attributes and digital behavior
2020-0041,8,"also, age significantly affects the perception of security among older users"
2020-0041,9,practical implications: this study will help fintech service providers to design fintech services considering a wide spectrum of users
2020-0041,10,more consideration should be on enhancing the usefulness and security features to create social affirmations for the use of fintech services
2020-0041,11,this will entice users for frequent use and attract nonusers to do their first online financial transaction
2020-0041,12,originality/value: the study adds to the technology acceptance literature by incorporating relevant technological and behavioral attributes and investigating the moderating effect of digital behavior and demographic characteristics

2020-0080,0,"the financial services industry is currently undergoing a major transformation, with digitization and sustainability being the core drivers"
2020-0080,1,"while both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often conceived as green fintech, remains underdetermined"
2020-0080,2,"therefore, this paper contributes to this important discussion about green fintech by, first, synthesizing the relevant literature systematically"
2020-0080,3,"second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis of the swiss fintech landscape both in terms of green fintech startups as well as the services offered by the incumbents"
2020-0080,4,"the research results show that literature in this new domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated aspects of green fintech and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic yet"
2020-0080,5,"in addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that green fintech has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering customertocustomer (c2c), businesstocustomer (b2c), and businesstobusiness (b2b) services"
2020-0080,6,today the field is predominantly captured by startup companies in contrast to the incumbents whose solutions are still rare
2020-0142,0,"financial inclusion, in essence, is about promoting broader access to and usage of financial services, in particular payment services"
2020-0142,1,at the heart of payment services are transaction accounts
2020-0142,2,this paper will describe the crucial role played by transaction accounts and how stakeholders can promote access and use of these accounts

2020-0142,4,the discussion will be based on two reports on payment aspects of financial inclusion released by the committee on payments and market infrastructures and the world bank
2020-0142,5,"the framework developed to promote access and use of transaction accounts in the first report underpins the second report, which assesses the potential of fintech developments for financial inclusion"
2020-0143,0,"in light of the fast-growing role of non-bank financial institutions in national payment systems worldwide, this paper explores the experience and practice of central banks with regard to the grant- ing of access to real-time gross settlement (rtgs) systems and considers the related policy issues"
2020-0143,1,"spe- cifically, in their capacity as settlement agencies and operators of their national rtgs systems, many central banks are today considering the merits of extending rtgs access to retail payment service providers (psps) other than commercial banks, to include emerging companies that apply technology to the provision of payment or payment-related services"
2020-0143,2,"this paper frames the issue within the broader context of whether, and to what extent, access to rtgs systems should be extended to non-bank psps"
2020-0143,3,"decades of experience with rtgs systems across countries in different stages of financial sector development, in an increasingly globalised marketplace, have revealed a number of practical problems for central banks, the direct users of rtgs systems, and other beneficiaries of their services"
2020-0143,4,this paper draws on such experience and practice
2020-0143,5,the paper ends by submitting a few con- siderations on how rtgs access issues relate to central bank digital currencies

2020-0103,6,"further, to evaluate the effect of fintech patents on the companys value, a combination of car of patent application and poisson intensities were used"
2020-0103,7,research findings provide evidence that fintech innovations bring significant value for innovators and blockchain being especially valuable
2020-0103,8,"such innovations as blockchain, robo-advising and mobile transactions are the most valuable for the financial sector"
2020-0103,9,"on one side of the spectrum, the financial industry can be affected more negatively by the innovation of nonfinancial startups that carry disruptive technology at their core"
2020-0103,10,"however, on the other side of the spectrum, market leaders who make significant investments in their innovations can evade most of these negative effects"
2020-0103,11,this helped to form an overall view of fintech innovations
2020-0017,0,accessing financial services is considered one of the main challenges facing communities during crises
2020-0017,1,this research studies the role of using fintech applications to build resilience during the covid-19 pandemic

2020-0062,4,"in doing so, our findings offer insights into the dynamics of fe emergence that is transforming the financial landscape globally, and may be helpful to practitioners who are looking to effect organization-wide cultural change and the 'compliant by design' approach"
2020-0049,0,whether fintech causes the fragility of financial institutions is a controversial issue
2020-0049,1,"using a panel sample of listed banks from 84 countries, we exploit the introduction of fintech regulatory sandboxes as an exogenous shock and examine the heterogeneous effect of fintech on the fragility of financial institutions"
2020-0049,2,"we find that (i) a shock to fintech innovations has no net effect on the fragility of financial institutions when we ignore market characteristics, (ii) promoting fintech decreases (increases) the fragility of financial institutions in emerging (developed) financial markets, and (iii) fintech affects the fragility of financial institutions through the channel of profitability"
2020-0003,0,fintech innovations are enabling access to financial services through mobile devices for many unbanked in the world
2020-0003,1,"though fintech innovations are touted as game changers in deepening financial inclusion, their wide acceptance and use still remain limited"
2020-0003,2,"in the extant literature, technological and behavioural antecedents that influence users behaviour toward financial technologies are not fully understood"
2020-0003,3,this study argues that understanding antecedents to the actual use of fintech innovations will lead to deepening financial inclusion
2020-0003,4,"using mobile moneya type of fintech innovation, this study adopts the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (utaut2) and the prospect theory"
2020-0003,5,"drawing on survey data collected from 294 respondents, this study applies the partial least square structural equation modelling technique"
2020-0003,6,the findings show that performance and effort expectancy have significant relationship with the intention to use mobile money services
2020-0003,7,"however, contrary to well-established positions, price value, hedonic motivation, social influence and perceived risk do not influence intention and use of mobile money services"
2020-0003,8,the study makes significant theoretical contributions and offers practical and policy implications for deepening financial inclusion

2020-0153,4,we give further suggestions and guidelines for universities how to develop such programs
2020-0154,0,financial technologies (fintech) are gaining popularity amongst organizations due to its ability in improving their competitiveness
2020-0154,1,"as a result, organizations are seeking ways in the development of fintech projects"
2020-0154,2,"the performance evaluation of the most suitable fintech project, however, is complex and challenging due to the involvement of multiple decision makers, the multi-dimensional nature of the evaluation process and the presence of vagueness and imprecision inherent in the human decision making process"
2020-0154,3,"to deal with this problem, this paper presents a multicriteria group decision making approach for evaluating the performance of fintech projects"
2020-0154,4,intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used for effectively modelling the vagueness and imprecision of the decision making process
2020-0154,5,a multicriteria group decision making approach is developed for calculating an overall performance index for every fintech project alternative across all criteria
2020-0154,6,a fintech project performance evaluation problem is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
2020-0155,0,"the objective of this study is to examine the perceived benefits of the application of fintech, machine learning and artificial intelligence (ai) or (fmai) in programmed decision making for the consumers, producers or employers"
2020-0155,1,"the study is based on a theoretical model, developed step by step to explain consumers' satisfaction and employers' benefits when the company or the employer introduces fintech, machine learning and ai for implementing the policies in programmed decisions"
2020-0155,2,"the results and findings show that the application of fintech, machine learning and ai will maximize the consumers' satisfaction and employers' benefits"
2020-0155,3,"the application of fmai saves time for the consumers, minimizes the number of trips to the offices, and reduces the confrontations with the unpleasant customer service representatives"
2020-0155,4,"fmai are user friendly, and it has the potential to increase consumers' satisfaction as well as employers' benefits by nicely settling the issues with the consumers and other stakeholders"
2020-0155,5,the consumers remain the focal point and will make sure that consumers will not desert the company
2020-0155,6,this is perhaps one of the latest studies which blends fmai with programmed decision-making process and shows perceived benefits for both consumers and producers and thus society's total wellbeing will be the maximum
2020-0043,0,the novel corona virus (covid-19) is a phenomenon with the aftereffects of this pandemic can be felt in the next few years to come
2020-0043,1,"economic consequences of the pandemic are huge on the islamic finance industry, it is also evident from the slow growth forecast by the various agencies for the industry"
2020-0043,2,"in this paper, we consider this pandemic as an opportunity for the islamic finance industry to grow and prove its worth again after the global financial crisis of 2008 and emerge as a major contender to the conventional financial system"
2020-0043,3,"we develop a model which reveals that covid-19 is an opportunity with more integrated and transformative growth with high level of standardization, with key focus of the industry on the social cause and tactical adoption of financial technology"
2020-0043,4,the paper has an implication to the islamic finance and banking industry as it provides a framework for the future researchers and practitioners to understand and adopt islamic finance in the post covid-19 era
2020-0156,0,the current study aims to examine the factors affecting the acceptance of the digital wallets in kingdom of bahrain
2020-0156,1,a multi-item scale is designed to measure the different risk and benefit factors

2020-0077,0,this paper explores the most recent fintech (financial technology) phenomenon from an ecosystem perspective
2020-0077,1,"differentiated from the earlier fintech evolution led by traditional financial institutions, cross-sector fintech that operates at the intersection of financial services and information technology disrupts existing business models of banks while creating novel ecosystem dynamics"
2020-0077,2,this study explores the fintech ecosystem composition to understand better business model innovation based on underlying ecosystem dynamics while focusing on the specific role of cross-sector actors
2020-0077,3,these actors have escaped scrutiny despite being mature and experienced and having strong resource bases
2020-0077,4,"adopting a comparative case study method by considering the china-based alibaba group and tencent, the studys findings indicate that novel business model developments based on strong technological expertise and scale-based resources by cross-sector fintech render a functional perspective on fast-developing fintech industry less practical"
2020-0077,5,"apart from cross-sector fintech, investors constitute a new dimension in the conceptualization of the fintech ecosystem"
2020-0077,6,"overall, the interconnectedness of the cross-sector fintech beyond the fintech sectors drives the fuzzy boundaries between ecosystems, established business models, terminology definitions, ecosystem actors roles and relationships, which appear to become more heterogeneous and changeable over time"
2020-0077,7,the study contributes to the scant literature on fintech ecosystems and their sustainable development
2020-0158,0,[no abstract available
2020-0042,0,"in the introduction to the first-ever special issue on the spatial dimensions of fintech, we show that despite a fintech fever in business and media, research on fintech is still niche, particularly in social sciences"
2020-0042,1,"we describe fintech as a research area full of controversies, ripe and in need of geographical research"
2020-0042,2,"as we outline, papers in this issue contribute to the debate primarily by examining the role of the state, financial centres and uneven development in fintech"
2020-0055,0,this paper analyses how different entrepreneurial actors respond to political uncertainty and changing institutional settings
2020-0055,1,"moreover, it discusses the impact of those actor-level responses on the resilience of entrepreneurial ecosystems (ees), focusing on how they affect the diversity of and the connectivity among its actors"
2020-0055,2,"to address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the united kingdom to leave the european union has influenced the financial technology (fintech) industry in london, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in londons fintech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies"
2020-0055,3,"our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an ee"
2020-0055,4,"moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks"
2020-0055,5,"with regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses"
2020-0029,0,fintech and digital financial services involve the delivery of financial products and services through technology
2020-0029,1,"fintech companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to big banks, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor"
2020-0029,2,"for many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in kenya, fintech is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid"
2020-0029,3,"while refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of fintech as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the global north to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support"
2020-0029,4,"through fintech, private citizens and groups in the global north are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion"
2020-0029,5,"while fintech remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans"
2020-0029,6,this paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through fintech are still distinguished largely by exclusion
2020-0029,7,"in so doing, this paper highlights a theoretical position that refugee governance is embedded in racial forms of capital accumulation and expropriation"
2020-0014,0,the rise of fintech challenges established financial centres and incumbent financial institutions to rethink their strategies to remain obligatory passage points in the age of digitizing finance
2020-0014,1,"to appreciate these changes, it is important to maintain theoretical interchange between developments in financial geography and economic geography, its parent discipline"
2020-0014,2,"in this paper, we argue that the ways in which evolutionary economic geography impacts strategic coupling in global financial networks are crucial to grasp tomorrows geographies of fintech"
2020-0014,3,"through an in-depth examination of brussels, we analyse the potential of fintech opening a window of locational opportunity in financial services"
2020-0014,4,belgium has put together a strategy to seize this window by leveraging its politically neutral image and brussels existing niche in financial collaboration and infrastructural plumbing
2020-0014,5,the latter status is exemplified by the presence of global players swift and euroclear
2020-0014,6,"we analyse how belgian entrepreneurs and politicians assess brussels locational resources, and strategically couple big financial institutions with small tech startups in order to cultivate a fintech ecosystem in the service of incumbent finance, constituting a fin-tech-state triangle"
2020-0014,7,"as such, we document and analyse how the coalescence of finance and technology offers new opportunities for second-tier financial centres, while highlighting the difficulties in reaping these in practice"
2020-0159,0,"this paper, proposed a mobile application that provides islamic finance options to clients using a special type of forwarding sale known as salam contract, the proposed system as well provides answers to client inquiries about the salam contract, such as cost of finance, quantity to be delivered as a payoff, and delivery place and time, the proposed system converting the traditional salam contract to e-salam contract to maximize the benefits and attractiveness of the modes, this approach required a complete electronic system can easily interact with the clients and execute the contract steps applying the required conditions of islamic sharia as well, this proposal provides digital application structure to be used by both islamic bank and clients easily and perfectly"
2020-0159,1,"hence, the proposed application helps applicants to provide the necessary information (financeable products, calculating the amount to be returned in the form of a quantity of the product, etc.)"
2020-0159,2,the proposal enables islamic banks to provide financial services to rural areas where no branches but internet service available
2020-0159,3,delivery points available in the system with specific locations to make it easy for farmers to fulfill the contract obligations
2020-0159,4,this proposal was checked and revised by different experts in banking and it specialists and approved by sharia scholars
2020-0159,5,"the proposed system focus on possibilities, extra papers on experiments will follow in further papers"
2020-0021,0,purpose: this study aims to explore the existing islamic financial technology (fintech) lending in indonesia
2020-0021,1,doing so is to better understand in what way the fintech firms have been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (sdgs) in the local context
2020-0021,2,design/methodology/approach: this study engages qualitative methods
2020-0021,3,this paper first reviews relevant literature related to fintech and establishes the substantive definition of islamic fintech
2020-0021,4,"further, the existing literature of sdgs is explored to understand its original idea and its recent implementation, particularly in indonesia"
2020-0021,5,"following this, the official reports from the domestic regulators are referred to select the fintech firms which meet the criteria of islamic fintech lending based on the proposed definition"
2020-0021,6,the selected firms are then analysed based on several themes which best capture their position in promoting the sdgs
2020-0021,7,"finally, the discussion is linked to the recent performance of indonesia in implementing sdgs"
2020-0021,8,"findings: this work finds that the reviewed fintech firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro enterprises (smes)"
2020-0021,9,"furthermore, the selected fintech firms are also found to collect and distribute islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and sadaqah (voluntary charity)"
2020-0021,10,"besides, the firms are also found to initiate charity programmes for underprivileged community"
2020-0021,11,"in some degree, these findings are synonymous of the firms effort in promoting sdg of ending poverty (sdg 1) and hunger (sdg 2) and reducing the inequalities (sdg 10)"
2020-0021,12,research limitations/implications: the discussion of this work does not provide any positivist generalisation due to the method used
2020-0021,13,practical implications: the indonesian government is advised to legally engage with the existing fintech firms and other related stakeholders to best solve its recent issue of the declining trend in sdg 15 (life on land)
2020-0021,14,social implications: this work elaborates in what way the islamic fintech lending has been promoting the sdgs in indonesian context
2020-0021,15,"in some extent, such discussion can best challenge the social issue of fintech which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah (harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in indonesia"
2020-0021,16,originality/value: this study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of islamic fintech and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of sdgs
2020-0160,0,the interesting thing about this paper is that the era of the covid-19 pandemic has brought big changes in all aspects of global life
2020-0160,1,"likewise, the fintech industry has produced digital product applications by providing comfortable user experience"
2020-0160,2,"the fintech user experience (ux) is in a fairly good position to adapt to the global world and during the covid-19 pandemic, online transactions have increased in use"
2020-0160,3,most of the fintech platforms are already in the online format
2020-0160,4,"however, the paradigm shift caused by the corona-virus forced the ux fintech sector to provide support for accelerating creative solutions to new problems in accelerating economic recovery during the covid 19 pandemic"
2020-0161,0,"with the rise of financial technology startups (so called fintechs) and the adoption of open banking business models, the banking industry is witnessing revolutionary changes"
2020-0161,1,"to adopt these revolutionary changes, banks are collaborating with fintechs to develop innovative products and services for the customers"
2020-0161,2,"banks, which are ruled by conventional practices, have been using very secure and closed computer-based systems whereas building a fintech ecosystem requires integration to countless 3rd party software services (so called apis) in a secure and robust way"
2020-0161,3,this paper discusses the design and development of a fintech api gateway in terms of business needs and technical challenges
2020-0161,4,"additionally, business requirements, technical design decisions, development challenges and key performance metrics of the api gateway are discussed and explained in detail"
2020-0162,0,payment financial technology (fintech) has rapidly developed in indonesia
2020-0162,1,"in this case, payment fintech enables people to perform the transaction comfortably, such as for electricity bill payment, food ordering, and purchasing the game accessories"
2020-0162,2,"however, fintech payment emerges the issues to the customer as well"
2020-0162,3,"in this part, several problems are encountered by fintech payment system"
2020-0162,4,"in this background, the payment system in indonesia is regulated by the central bank"
2020-0162,5,"technically, the payment must comply with the four principles of payment system such as secure, effective, fairness, and customer protection"
2020-0162,6,"therefore, this quantitative research explores the four principles of payment system towards the intention of the fintech payment system, especially for ovo customers"
2020-0162,7,"spss application facilitates the process, and the linear regression technique applies to analyze the data based on the model"
2020-0162,8,the process is conducted partially and simultaneously
2020-0162,9,the partial result of the research indicates the efficiency variable and fairness variable that has a significant influence on the intention of the utilization
2020-0162,10,"however, the concurrent process for all variables presents a considerable result of the intention of the utilization factor"
2020-0162,11,the research results significantly contribute to future improvement feedback and development in the industry
2020-0104,0,"the emergence of new technologies and players, along with a favorable regulatory framework (psd2 directive), is changing the banking industry"
2020-0104,1,fintechs and techfins have allowed the introduction of new services and changed the way customers interact to satisfy their financial needs
2020-0104,2,the fintech landscape is constantly evolving in the market
2020-0104,3,"different business value propositions are entering the financial services industry, moving from increasing the user's experience to developing a time to market framework for banks to innovate products, processes, and channels, increasing the cost efficiency and looking for a partnering on order to lighten the regulatory burdens for banks"
2020-0104,4,"the many businesses of banks are changing their value chains, and banks' business models should do the same accordingly"
2020-0104,5,strategists could no longer take their value chains as a given
2020-0104,6,"choices have to be made on what needs to be protected and maintained, what abandoned and the new on coming to make banks evolve and become more resilient in doing their job"
2020-0104,7,"banking is shifting significantly from a pipeline, vertical paradigm, to open banking business models where open innovation, modularity, and ecosystem-based bank's business model may become the ongoing mainstream and paradigm to follow and develop"
2020-0104,8,opportunities and threats for banks are many and new ones to re-gaining their role in the market throughout a re-intermediation process
2020-0163,0,the current pandemic situation has opened requirements for getting maximum support not only from government bodies but also from general public and nonprofit organizations
2020-0163,1,aiding a non-profit organization with financial aspects is a common concern due to lack of transparency in flow of funds taking place for the indicated social issues
2020-0163,2,there is an immediate need for a channel or mechanism to support and validate the cash flow in such scenarios
2020-0163,3,"in this paper, we explore the generic issues in this topic and propose our idea to solve the same"
2020-0163,4,"this paper talks about a financial platform backed by a bank x, that channelizes, reports and provides earmarked funds from charity accounts of donors (just like a regular fixed deposit account online interface) to accounts of non-profitable government organizations (ngos) aka beneficiaries (irrespective of banks)"
2020-0163,5,"this significantly solves the challenge posed by lack of transparency and accountability on the part of ngos and dramatically increases donor confidence and thereby the number of donors, average donation size and frequency"
2020-0081,0,"the covid-19 pandemic has created an environment of uncertainty, stress and financial vulnerability"
2020-0081,1,"as countries all over the world adopted preventive strategies ranging from voluntary isolations to stringent lockdowns, people and businesses were required to adjust their dispositions to the new normal resulting in new behaviors"
2020-0081,2,the customer behaviour in financial services was also impacted and especially in developing economies as people were required to move to digital financial platforms at haste
2020-0081,3,"in recent times, fintech services are on a steady rise globally but their presence in the emerging markets is in a nascent stage and adoption by the low-income segment customers has largely been elusive"
2020-0081,4,much work is required to understand the needs of this customer cohort to identify factors for product adoption
2020-0081,5,this study investigates the impact on financial behavior among low-income segment customers for fintech services due to the pandemic
2020-0081,6,"by testing a set of hypotheses regarding inclination to adopt fintech the study presents prominent antecedents such as fear, social influence, awareness and trust that led to positive product adoption"
2020-0081,7,the study discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of the study and presents direction for future research

2020-0165,0,"nowadays, banks are experiencing a period in which financial technology is changing the fundamental concepts of banking products"
2020-0165,1,the first step that every bank should take is proper investment in financial technologies
2020-0165,2,"instead of kazakhstani banks, however, it is the government that is making huge efforts to develop the fintech market"
2020-0165,3,"the goal of this review paper is to evaluate the development of the fintech market of kazakhstan and demonstrate the inefficiency of investments for the main industry of the financial market, namely, kazakhstani second-tier banks"
2020-0165,4,review of studies on kazakhstan's fintech market development made along with testing the hypothesis that government investments have no relationship with bank revenues
2020-0165,5,"a relationship analysis was conducted between on the one hand fintech investments in kazakhstan and on the other hand revenues from account management, revenues from lending and financing, revenues from payments, and revenues from financial assets and capital markets of the banking industry of kazakhstan and the us"
2020-0165,6,"the analysis showed the weakest relationship of fintech investments in kazakhstan to revenues from lending and financing for kazakhstan and equally weak relationship to revenues from account management, revenues from payments, and revenues from financial assets and capital markets"
2020-0165,7,"in addition, analysis shows that all four types of revenue have a strong relationship with investment for the us and correlation analysis resulted in the strongest relationship to revenues from payments for the us"
2020-0165,8,analysis points out positive relationship of investments to fintech market of us and reverse state for kazakhstan
2020-0165,9,findings: the level of penetration of fintech in the kazakhstani market is markedly below that of developed economies
2020-0165,10,investments in fintech are more income efficient for us banks than is the case with kazakhstani banks
2020-0165,11,kazakhstan's financial market mostly consists of commercial banks and efforts to develop the fintech market largely sourced from the government have no relation with bank incomes
2020-0091,0,an asset allocation optimization model for key clients and financial products is developed and deployed on a business platform by compiling a program to a module using matlab to show how to integrate financial big data and fintech in a real application for a bank
2020-0091,1,"firstly, we establish a single objective linear programming model with the percent of assets in products as the decision variables, the minimum-weighted duration as the objective, and the business requirements as constraints"
2020-0091,2,"then, we select non-integer linear programming as the model solver by testing two algorithm solvers with six real test cases separately, according to the solving time"
2020-0091,3,"finally, we directly compile the model and the algorithm program into a module to complete the deployment into a business platform to quickly complete the transformation of data and model the actual productivity of the bank"
2020-0048,0,"after the 200708 global financial crisis, research flourished on entrepreneurship through digital innovation in the financial market as well as on investors influence on digital technology-based entrepreneurs funding decisions"
2020-0048,1,"this study combines these two research streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital entrepreneurship, technology, and banking"
2020-0048,2,the study first uses prior literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria in funding
2020-0048,3,"except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in different markets, andas with most digital business modelsscalability was identified as a key criterion"
2020-0048,4,"additionally, by serving as a major provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs"
2020-0048,5,"through developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders in fintechs and, hence, equity investors"
2020-0048,6,"we also describe how these formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements, digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration"
2020-0166,0,"to determine the micro-operating mechanism(mom) of enterprises participating in the regulatory sandbox policy in fintech, this study analyzes the structure of enterprise innovation competencies and derives relevant implications"
2020-0166,1,"the results reveal that large, middle-standing, and small and medium-sized enterprises focus on security, infrastructure, and user-related technology development, respectively, to enhance their innovation competencies"
2020-0166,2,the security-related issues considered by large enterprises entail relatively high costs in initial technology development and are closely related to infrastructure building
2020-0166,3,"large enterprises are focused on developing overall security-related technologies, whereas middle-standing enterprises are striving to develop infrastructure-related technologies, with particular emphasis on elementary technologies"
2020-0166,4,small and medium-sized enterprises are also making efforts to develop user-centered technologies that can directly be used in fintech
2020-0166,5,"as a method to implement regulatory sandboxes tailored to the needs of participating enterprises in south korea, this study will help to determine the mom of such participants and establish strategies to support them sustainably in terms of evidence-based policy"
2020-0167,0,this article engages with the critical study of contemporary publicity by examining transparency as a strategic project to platformize financial services
2020-0167,1,the article contributes to understandings of transparency as value cocreation in business-to-business markets
2020-0167,2,"through field-level discourse analysis, the article shows that transparency is contingent primarily on the nature of the market, in this case, a platformized industry, which valorizes transparency as part of a regime of data sharing and open access"
2020-0167,3,transparency is further contingent on the market actor: actors with lesser status and market legitimacy are more likely to seek to cocreate transparency with market actors of greater or similar status and legitimacy
2020-0167,4,"the article concludes that in commercial spaces, publicitys relationship to transparency is not only determined by market logic, but that all market logics are being drawn further toward a technological definition of transparency as shareveillance, as more segments of economic life become platformized"
2020-0019,0,"using data from chinese commercial banks between 2008 and 2017, this paper explores the effects of bank fintech on credit risk"
2020-0019,1,we first construct and measure a bank fintech index using web crawler technology and word frequency analysis
2020-0019,2,the results show that the development of bank fintech is faster in state-owned banks than in other banks
2020-0019,3,"moreover, among the five subareas of bank fintech, the development of internet technology is ahead of artificial intelligence technology, blockchain technology, cloud computing technology, and big data technology"
2020-0019,4,"then, the impacts of bank fintech on credit risk are examined"
2020-0019,5,"we find that bank fintech significantly reduces credit risk in chinese commercial banks, and further analyses show that the negative effects of bank fintech on credit risk are relatively weak among large banks, state-owned banks, and listed banks"
2020-0018,0,"in this paper, we propose a novel approach to examine the risk spillovers between fintech firms and traditional financial institutions, during a time of fast technological advances"
2020-0018,1,based on the stock returns of u.s
2020-0018,2,"financial and fintech institutions, we estimate pairwise risk spillovers by using the granger causality test across quantiles"
2020-0018,3,"we consider the whole distribution: the left tail (bearish case), the right tail (bullish case) and the center of the distribution and construct three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center) and obtain network-based spillover indicators"
2020-0018,4,we find that linkages in the network are stronger in the bearish case when the risk of spillover is higher
2020-0018,5,fintech institutions' risk spillover to financial institutions positively correlates with financial institutions' increase in systemic risk
2020-0018,6,"these results have important policy implications, as they underscore the importance of enhancing the supervision and regulation of fintech companies, to maintain financial stability"
2020-0038,0,"purpose: the purpose of this study is to define fintech, differentiating it from financial technology and use the definition to develop an industry framework"
2020-0038,1,"design/methodology/approach: using the existing literature on fintech and incorporating these contributions into a traditional financial structure, characteristics are outlined and placed into a framework that describes the fintech industry"
2020-0038,2,"findings: fintech is a specific type of financial technology, defined as technology used to provide financial markets a financial product or financial service, characterized by sophisticated technology relative to existing technology in that market"
2020-0038,3,firms that primarily use fintech are classified as fintech firms
2020-0038,4,"using these definitions, the paper provides a structure for the fintech industry, classifying each type of fintech firm by fintech characteristics"
2020-0038,5,research limitations/implications: research that would inform the economic importance of fintech would be served with an increased understanding of fintech firms and the fintech industry
2020-0038,6,originality/value: this paper contributes by defining fintech and developing a comprehensive framework to describe the emerging fintech industry
2020-0030,0,purpose: this paper reviews recent advances in the empirical literature of fintech and household finance
2020-0030,1,"design/methodology/approach: we survey the effects of fintech on three different aspects of household finance: payments, lending and portfolio decisions"
2020-0030,2,"specifically, we examine the impact of digital payments, mobile money, fintech lending, marketplace lending, robo-advising and crowd-funding"
2020-0030,3,findings: studies suggest that fintech has positively benefited households by increasing consumption and borrowing
2020-0030,4,this allows them to smoothen their consumption across time
2020-0030,5,"furthermore, there is an improvement in their portfolio diversification"
2020-0030,6,"nonetheless, there is also evidence that certain households overconsume and borrow beyond their means"
2020-0030,7,"originality/value: despite the importance of this topic, there has been a lack of empirical evidence until recently"
2020-0030,8,"in this paper, we take stock of the empirical evidence in the literature through the lens of household finance"
2020-0015,0,financial technologies (fintech) are proposed to expand access to financial services in rural communities as bank branches decline
2020-0015,1,"however, poor rural communities and rural communities of color have limited access to high-speed internet connections required for fintech"
2020-0015,2,leveraging the universe of u.s
2020-0015,3,"rural zip codes, this paper investigates associations between communities poverty rates, racial makeup, and rates of fintech"
2020-0015,4,poor rural communities of color experience digital redlining by having the lowest fintech rates
2020-0015,5,"rural communities increasing white population is associated with higher high-speed internet rates, an advantage of whiteness observable even in the presence of high poverty"
2020-0015,6,implications are discussed
2020-0105,0,"fintech has significantly expanded the offer of financial services available to users, facilitating the spread of new financing, payment and exchange services in increasingly large sections of the population"
2020-0105,1,"however, there is a downside, represented by the lack of organic regulation that defines the perimeter of legality"
2020-0105,2,"world legislators, europeans in particular, have started building a structured legal framework and to prevent (or to catch) opportunistic or criminal behaviors"
2020-0105,3,among the unavoidable challenges for the anti-money laundering system are those related to the development of fintech which produces significant volumes of transactions
2020-0105,4,in this paper it is provided a systematic review of a) the most common money laundering patterns
2020-0105,5,"b) the european anti-money laundering legal framework, and c) the most recent and relevant fraud cases detected by the enforcements agencies"
2020-0105,6,the main objective of this research is to verify whether the behavior of economic players within the fintech sector can be contained within the limits of legality
2020-0105,7,"another objective, far from secondary, is to analyze the current patterns that lead to money laundering, also verifying whether there are tools, within the fintech itself, capable of exploiting technologies and identifying dark or illegal practices"
2020-0105,8,the recent case study of scandals within the fintech industry further helps to support the hypotheses and conclusions of the research itself
2020-0168,0,"in the past decade, it stated that the discourse on sustainable development and the financial technology(fintech) role in the financial and banking industries, has attention on researchers, practitioners, regulators, and policymakers"
2020-0168,1,the real problem arises from the discourse on whether fintech has an effect on sustainable development in the financial and banking industry in indonesia
2020-0168,2,this discourse needed to be understood better and more deeply
2020-0168,3,"for credible research results, it is necessary to use a mixedmethod research approach"
2020-0168,4,"this research aims to develop a model that will help uncover the phenomenon of fintech to sustainable development in the financial and banking industry in indonesia, using mixed methods research"
2020-0168,5,"in this study, exploratory sequential mixed method used as a type of mixedmethod approach"
2020-0168,6,"the main results of this study reveal that fintech, which is influenced by business drivers, has a significant role in sustainable development in the financial and banking industry in indonesia"
2020-0168,7,the contribution of this research can provide insight and understanding for researchers and practitioners in the financial and banking industry who want to implement a sustainable development model based on fintech in more depth
2020-0169,0,"as you know, the covid-19 pandemic has impacted most of the world's economies, the financial sector, and the development of financial technology software tools"
2020-0169,1,today fintech projects are drivers of the development of the financial sector
2020-0169,2,there are prerequisites for the development and implementation of financial technologies in kazakhstan
2020-0169,3,"first, the development of fintech is a global trend driven by technological progress, the growth of e-commerce, socio-demographic changes and banking restrictions"
2020-0169,4,"in this sense, kazakhstan is rapidly moving in line with global trends, in 2019 it showed outstanding results"
2020-0169,5,"secondly, according to the kpmg study on the impact of covid-19 on the economy of kazakhstan, almost all respondents paid attention to the need to develop online technologies in their organizations"
2020-0169,6,"the trend will be solutions for working with big data, allowing you to create personal offers for customers, minimize risks, manage production, and intracelomic conditions"
2020-0002,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to clarify theory and identify factors that could explain the level of fintech continuance intentions with an expectation confirmation model that integrates self-efficacy theory
2020-0002,1,"design/methodology/approach: with data collected from 753 fintech users, this study applies partial least square structural equation modeling to compare and select the research model with the most predictive power"
2020-0002,2,"findings: the results show that financial self-efficacy, technological self-efficacy and confirmation positively affect perceived usefulness"
2020-0002,3,"among these factors, financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy have both direct and indirect effects through confirmation on perceived usefulness"
2020-0002,4,perceived usefulness and confirmation are positively related to satisfaction
2020-0002,5,"finally, perceived usefulness and satisfaction positively influence fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0002,6,"originality/value: to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies that investigates the effect of domain-specific self-efficacy on fintech continuance intentions, which enriches the existing research on fintech and deepens our understanding of users' fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0002,7,we distinguish between financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy and specify the relationship between self-efficacy and continuance intentions
2020-0002,8,"moreover, this study highlights the importance of assessing a model's predictive power using the plspredict technique and provides a reference for model selection"
2020-0170,0,"nowadays, fundraising is one of the most important issues for both fintech investors and startups"
2020-0170,1,"the pattern of fundraising in terms of ""number and type of rounds and stages needed"" are important"
2020-0170,2,the diverse features and factors that could stem from fintech business models which can influence success are of the key issues in shaping these patterns
2020-0170,3,this study applied the top 100 kpmg fintech startups' data to extract clusters and fundraising pattern using sequential pattern discovery for each cluster
2020-0170,4,this led to the extraction of seven distinct clusters using 3 different clustering algorithms from 3 to 7 different rounds of investment for each cluster
2020-0170,5,the proposed frequent patterns can assist both investors and fintech startups to show the future fundraising pattern based on their new or current startup cluster type and the ongoing stages of development
2020-0076,0,"new financial technology holds the promise of innovation and competition, challenging established products and services and frequently improving market processes"
2020-0076,1,"however, regulation of these new services faces a double challenge: to keep pace with innovation and facilitate new market entries while at the same time understanding and managing the regulatory risks that are involved"
2020-0076,2,"at this stage, the existing eu regulatory framework is of little help: the bulk of the present body of financial regulation stems from a different time, with different regulatory problems in mind"
2020-0076,3,eu regulation is also very slow to change and to adapt
2020-0076,4,"therefore, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox""- an experimentation space - as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive"
2020-0076,5,"a sandbox would allow market participants to test fintech services in the real market, with real consumers, but under the close scrutiny of the supervisor"
2020-0076,6,"the benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market""cycle of financial innovation, while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection"
2020-0076,7,"at the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a technical field which is sometimes poorly understood, both for firms and for the regulator"
2020-0076,8,this would help to reduce the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants
2020-0076,9,"in the particular eu legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward"
2020-0076,10,"in this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the eu member states, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by eu institutions"
2020-0076,11,"this innovative approach would be somewhat uncharted territory for the eu, and thereby also contribute to the future development of eu financial market governance as a whole"
2020-0171,0,management of technology and innovation (mot) can contribute to competitiveness of industries including banking and financial services insurance (bfsi)
2020-0171,1,technological innovations such as fintech are rapidly transforming bfsi and have major competitiveness implications for legacy players
2020-0171,2,key objective of our study is to understand the dimensions of innovation and identify options-particularly one based on mot for sustainability-for firms in emerging countries
2020-0171,3,"we adapt a mixed method approach, where analysis of factual secondary data will be complemented by insights from literature review and experts"
2020-0171,4,"factual views indicate significant role of regional banks of indian origin (bios), some of them are innovating quite well leveraging capabilities of increasing competitiveness of software (sw or ict) firms and fintech ventures, including service, product and platform innovations"
2020-0171,5,"we analyse the patterns of competitiveness using alternate frameworks of competitiveness from porter diamond to competitiveness assets-processes-performance (app), focusing on trends for fintech's trying to leverage artificial intelligence (ai) and 'digital transformation'"
2020-0171,6,"findings indicate major disruptive threats to incumbent 'banking, financial services and insurance'(bfsi) majors in many emerging countries from fintech as well as technology giants such as gafa"
2020-0171,7,"while efforts in countries such as india through 'unified payment interface (upi)' may address issues of financial access, evolving a dominant design demands much bigger 'architectural innovation'"
2020-0171,8,we draw implications for different stakeholders and also suggest topics for further research
2020-0171,9,paper contributes to practice of mot and theory on multiple dimensions
2020-0032,0,"despite high expectations for the growth of fintech, it has not reached the expected growth in the real world"
2020-0032,1,"as fintech is innovative but inherently unpredictable, customers are still hesitant to adopt and use fintech, which ultimately affects its growth"
2020-0032,2,"to achieve the sustainable development and growth of fintech, an in-depth investigation of fintech continuance intentions is required"
2020-0032,3,"to investigate continuous-use behavior in a fintech context, this study focuses on two relevant issues: uncertainty and information technology (it) quality"
2020-0032,4,uncertainty is more critical in fintech than in traditional e-banking transactions because fintech transactions are complicated and less predictable
2020-0032,5,it quality is also crucial to fintech success because it plays a key role in fintech transactions
2020-0032,6,"this study mainly explores the relationship between uncertainty and it quality, both of which significantly affect fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0032,7,"for the purpose, we integrated an it quality-based perspective with a trust-based model to investigate fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0032,8,"our results demonstrate that system quality is negatively related to perceived risk, whereas information quality is positively related to trust"
2020-0032,9,service quality is the most important quality factor for controlling uncertainty and encouraging continued use of fintech
2020-0032,10,we found a more extended role of it in fintech than in other digital services
2020-0032,11,"this study provides fintech providers with the practical guidance in the design and implementation of fintech innovation, thereby achieving the sustainable development of fintech"
2020-0092,0,this study examines the difference between the fintechs that received private equity and venture capital funds and those that did not
2020-0092,1,"we test this with a sample of 2,524 companies across 76 countries over 20082018"
2020-0092,2,"we show a positive relationship between having received an angel and a seed round with follow-on financing, and a negative relationship with having a single founder"
2020-0092,3,the impact of the seed financing and the single founder is weaker in an emerging market
2020-0092,4,"furthermore, companies in financing and payments categories are more likely to receive funding"
2020-0040,0,financial technology (fintech) has gained a lot of attention and popularity in recent past years
2020-0040,1,some researchers blame it for disrupting financial ecosystem and while others admire it for redefining traditional business models
2020-0040,2,"according to the statista report 2018, transaction value in the crowdfunding segment amounts to us$ 5,250 mn in 2018"
2020-0040,3,the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of fintech applications and crowdfunding on customer retention in islamic banks of malaysia and the united arab emirates
2020-0040,4,a structured questionnaire consisting of 31 items was designed to gather data from 535 customers of selected banks from both countries through strata sampling
2020-0040,5,various statistical tests were done to check the association between fintech applications including crowdfunding and customer retention using spss 25.0
2020-0040,6,"the results indicated that financing application of fintech has no relevance to customer retention while as other variables such as payments, advisory services, compliance and crowdfunding has an impact on retaining customers in islamic banks of these two countries"
2020-0040,7,the conclusion of this study emphasis on expanding the range of applications of fintech services by islamic banks so that the customer will stay longer with the bank
2020-0040,8,"also, crowdfunding should be integrated into the islamic banking system so that it can help in social entrepreneurship, micro-finance and establishing global zakah and sadaqa system"

2020-0067,1,"the financial conduct authoritys sandbox regime has attracted fintech start-ups from around the world to test their technology and business with supervision and regulatory protections, providing an opportunity to grow into major businesses"
2020-0067,2,"the success of the intuitive sandbox has however led to it being replicated in jurisdictions worldwide, eager to benefit from the growth of fintech"
2020-0067,3,competition for high-calibre start-ups means the uks post-brexit sandbox may need to go further than its existing fintech sector strategy to continuing attracting and developing firms helping the city of london to remain the global centre of finance as perceived in the uks industrial strategy
2020-0067,4,"the article examines existing regulations and analyses how the uk can develop an enhanced structure to both further attract and accommodate legitimate high-calibre fintech entrepreneurs, whilst offering strong client and investor protections to ensure financial stability"
2020-0067,5,"it proposes unprecedented legal and policy reforms for the sandbox structure, including a permissible model to capitalise on funding from amateur private investors worldwide"
2020-0037,0,"given the rapid emergence of fintechs, the objective of this paper is to determine location-specific factors associated with fintech establishment intensity using porters diamond framework"
2020-0037,1,the analysis is based on a country-level dataset covering the period of 20072017 and 107 countries
2020-0037,2,"the results reveal that greater fintech establishment intensity characterizes smaller countries, countries with stronger information and communications technology (ict) services clusters, and countries that have experienced a crisis during the recent decade"
2020-0037,3,"greater fintech establishment intensity is also observed in countries with greater tertiary education enrolment rates, stronger university-industry cooperation, greater fixed line availability, and overall ict readiness"
2020-0037,4,the macroeconomic situation and indicators of financial development prove to be important determinants of fintech formation
2020-0037,5,"given the importance of several dimensions of locations diamond in fintech formation, fintech entrepreneurs could benefit from a careful analysis of the diamond of locations that they are considering as potential places of doing business"
2020-0037,6,"countries hoping to become more attractive fintech establishment sites, in turn, should focus on the elimination of weaknesses in the locations diamond in close co-operation with fintechs"
2020-0100,0,"this study investigates the millennials and gen z perception toward fintech services, their usage intention, and their financial behavior"
2020-0100,1,the study took place in the palestinian context with a global comparison among these generations
2020-0100,2,the authors used the questionnaire-based technique to meet the study objective
2020-0100,3,west bank respondents were selected for this purpose
2020-0100,4,the study instrument was distributed through different social media channels
2020-0100,5,the findings show that reliability/trust and ease of use are the main issues in using a financial service
2020-0100,6,"millennials are more aware (48%) of fintech services than gen z (38%), which is different from the global view where gen z is the highest"
2020-0100,7,"the smartphone penetration rate is 100% among both generations, while the financial inclusion ratio in palestine is around 36.4%"
2020-0100,8,"these clear indicators are the main fintech drivers to promote fintech services in palestine, and these are global indicators for fintech adoption intention"
2020-0100,9,"both generations (84%) intend to use e-wallet services, millennials (87%) and gen z is (70%) prefer using real-time services"
2020-0100,10,half of the respondents see that fintech plays a complementary role with banks
2020-0100,11,the majority see that fintech services are cheaper than bank services
2020-0100,12,"wealth management, and robot advisor services, and both generations are looking to acquire them in the long run"
2020-0100,13,"the authors revealed that 85% of respondents from both generations trust banks, so it is recommended that banks digitize their financial services to meet the customers' needs, considering that 90% of respondents see that promotions are a key issue in adopting fintech services"
2020-0100,14,promoting e-wallet services by banks is highly recommended due to the massive rivalry with fintech parties
2020-0106,0,financial technology or called fintech has brought a new color to the financial world
2020-0106,1,some positive impacts of fintech development in indonesia are the ease of financial services and completing the financial transaction chain
2020-0106,2,the purpose of this research is to evaluation an application member xyz using unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) method
2020-0106,3,this research using quantitative method and processed the data using smartpls
2020-0106,4,"the result from this research, some factors: effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions define as significant factor of user acceptance especially in fintech application"
2020-0107,0,this study aims to explore fintech for sustainable finance and sustainable development in indonesia and whether fintech can be a solution for sustainable finance and sustainable development in indonesia
2020-0107,1,it uses a descriptive-qualitative research design with the interpretive-exploratory paradigm
2020-0107,2,"research data obtained through secondary data from various research journals, articles, and government agencies"
2020-0107,3,it uses a content analysis technique that is done by drawing conclusions based on identifying the specific characteristics of a message objectively and systematically
2020-0107,4,"based on the research findings, this study strongly agreed that the existence of fintech platforms and applications in indonesia can certainly help move the wheels of the indonesian economy"
2020-0107,5,"with the existence of a non-cash community, corruption and illegal fees can be prevented and monitored"
2020-0107,6,"therefore, it concludes that fintech is proven to have a lot of benefits to increase state revenue so that it can be used as the media of digital economic solutions for sustainable finance and sustainable development in achieving the indonesian people's standard of living independently"
2020-0172,0,"nowadays, the existence of fintech services has been emerging in many parts of countries including indonesia"
2020-0172,1,this service combines financial services and mobile technology to serve consumers more effectively and efficiently relating to their needs of financial services
2020-0172,2,its market size is also growing giving sign that the service is widely accepted
2020-0172,3,"however, there is still a lack of study especially relating to consumer behavior in in adopting the service"
2020-0172,4,"therefore, the aim of this research is to study what factors influence consumers in adopting fintech services by surveying indonesian consumers"
2020-0172,5,"from 250 respondents, there are 204 forms filled"
2020-0172,6,"by conducting structural equation modeling (sem) using lisrel 8.80 software, all consumer's inputs are computed"
2020-0172,7,"from this computation, there are three results that can be drawn"
2020-0172,8,"first, it revealed that trust has generally influenced not only user's satisfaction but also his continuance use intention, meanwhile, his satisfaction may not influence his continuance use intention"
2020-0172,9,"second, all factors of convenience, performance, cost advantages, referent network size and perceived complementary are all together influencing user' satisfaction"
2020-0172,10,"third, all factors of authentication, non-repudiation, confidentially, privacy protection, and data integrity are all together needed to be considered"
2020-0172,11,"therefore, any fintech companies are suggested to be aware of these matters to win their customers in this market"
2020-0173,0,"this paper studies ten years (2008-2018) of annual financial data from four state-owned banks, macroeconomic data and data from the financial technology (fintech) industry using ratio analysis, dynamic estimation and common size statements analysis"
2020-0173,1,"the study also considers the analysis of independent attributes, for example, gdp growth, interest rates and fintech lending capacity and capability that could affect the financial performance of the banks"
2020-0173,2,"moreover, this research emphasizes that competition with fintech companies could affect banks' performance and the capacity to supply loans which bring the diminishing of banks' capability to disburse their loans, especially to msmes"
2020-0173,3,"in general, the results show that most of the banks are still capable of increasing lending capacity to msmes as mandated by the regulation in the short term"
2020-0173,4,"however, in the long term, the intention is moving slowly and tends to decrease, possibly due to the dynamics of economic growth and the development of financial technology companies"
2020-0173,5,"in particular, this study avails the strategy and policy that banks should be taking, for example, determining the risk management on capital invested in the long run amid the uncertainty of the economic situation, as reported previously in the long run as the gdp growth affected the msme financing"
2020-0173,6,"our research also contributes to the improvements of the banks' credit management, the effectiveness of loan distribution, and explains the repercussion of the fintech lending on msme"
2020-0173,7,"for instance, as mentioned in the analysis, this study suggests that the observations might have significant implications on further investigation on the prioritization of the strategy that optimally used to solve the issues on the allocation of funds by making collaboration between the bank and fintech companies"
2020-0173,8,"in addition, this study is expected to raise concern about financial inclusiveness amid the development of the digital economy"
2020-0173,9,"overall, this research supplies some insights into the evaluation process of banking sector's financial performance and the impact of macro-economy and digital economy through fintech on the bank lending services towards msmes, including analysis contributing to decision-makers in making correct decisions"
2020-0108,0,we perform a large scale analysis of a list of fintech terms in (i) news and blogs in the english language and (ii) professional descriptions of companies operating in many countries
2020-0108,1,the occurrence and the co-occurrence of fintech terms and locutions show a progressive evolution of the list of fintech terms in a compact and coherent set of terms used worldwide to describe fintech business activities
2020-0108,2,"by using methods of complex networks that are specifically designed to deal with heterogeneous systems, our analysis of a large set of professional descriptions of companies shows that companies having fintech terms in their description present over-expressions of specific attributes of country, municipality, and economic sector"
2020-0108,3,"by using the approach of statistically validated networks, we detect geographical and economic over-expressions of a set of companies related to the multi-industry, geographically, and economically distributed fintech movement"
2020-0174,0,purpose: this paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies
2020-0174,1,design/methodology/approach: this briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context
2020-0174,2,findings: african fintech companies looking to expand across the continent must consider the high levels of heterogeneity that exist within individual markets
2020-0174,3,"in order to overcome considerable challenges and secure market share, it is critical to have a flexible approach to marketing and adjust strategies as necessary to reach targeted consumer groups"
2020-0174,4,"originality/value: the briefing saves busy executives and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy-to-digest format"
2020-0109,0,"in light of increasing cashlessness, platform economies, open banking apis, financial bots and cryptocurrencies, money is on the move - once inert, money is gaining agency, becoming programmable, automated, data-driven and part of 'more than human' infrastructures"
2020-0109,1,"these financial futures demand that designers engage with difficult questions of economy and value, while retaining a sensibility to the many subtle and social qualities of money and our everyday economic interactions"
2020-0109,2,this one-day workshop will therefore bring together practitioners and researchers to explore design challenges related to four broad themes: designing with transactional data
2020-0109,3,designing alternative representations of value
2020-0109,4,"money, automation, power, and control"
2020-0109,5,and financial futures with vulnerable users
2020-0109,6,"developing scenarios related to these themes, the workshop will cultivate a rich design space to establish the value of design-led research in shaping our financial futures"
2020-0025,0,purpose: this paper aims to examine the determinants that influence bank users acceptance for islamic financial technology (fintech) services by extending the technology acceptance model (tam) in the malaysian context
2020-0025,1,design/methodology/approach: the survey was conducted using convenience sampling
2020-0025,2,"moreover, 205 responses were gathered from users of the islamic bank"
2020-0025,3,"on the same note, the literature on determinants of islamic fintech acceptance and tam was reviewed as well in a bid to contribute to the factors that are instrumental in determining the acceptance of fintech services"
2020-0025,4,"findings: findings of the study reveal that islamic fintechs services acceptance is determined by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and also by another variable, which is consumer innovativeness (ci)"
2020-0025,5,"on the contrary other factors, self-efficacy and subjective norms are found not to be influential in determining islamic fintechs acceptance by islamic banking users"
2020-0025,6,originality/value: tam is extended in the context of islamic fintech

2020-0117,4,"in the course of their development, the interests of new market entrants often overlap with those of traditional participants, mainly banks"
2020-0117,5,investigation of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future
2020-0117,6,the research of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future
2020-0117,7,the article considers both aspects of competition and aspects of possible cooperation between financial market participants in a digital economy
2020-0117,8,the results of the scientific research demonstrate that cooperation will prevail over the competition
2020-0117,9,probably existing financial institutions will reformat their architecture and become digital ones at the core
2020-0011,0,purpose: the purpose of this paper is to delineate a research agenda to guide future service research investigating the digital transformation of financial service systems through fintech  disruptive innovations by new market entrants that challenge the position of mainstream financial institutions
2020-0011,1,"design/methodology/approach: rooted in the philosophical foundations of use-inspired research, this paper addresses the managerially and societally relevant phenomenon of fintech by identifying, and responding to, the individual challenges and problems associated with the digital transformation of financial services"
2020-0011,2,"this is accomplished through a computational text-mining approach to analyze the corpus of 1,545 published practitioner articles associated with fintech, identification of managerial challenges therein and subsequent delineation of a novel research agenda"
2020-0011,3,"findings: by connecting managerial challenges relating to fintech with the service literature, this paper develops a use-inspired research agenda that provides scholarly and managerially relevant research directions (rds)"
2020-0011,4,"these pertain to the complexity of digital financial service systems (micro level), orchestration of value co-creation with fintech (meso level), and the development of elastic infrastructures, models and markets (macro level)"
2020-0011,5,research limitations/implications: fintech is an emerging phenomenon associated with the digital transformation of financial services
2020-0011,6,"however, actual guidelines on how service research related to fintech could be advanced from a theoretically as well as managerially relevant angle are unavailable to date"
2020-0011,7,"here, the authors address this challenge and provide the field with 18 tangible rds to advance service theory and practice"
2020-0011,8,practical implications: the purpose of this paper is to guide future academic research addressing managerial challenges associated with fintech and the digital transformation of financial service
2020-0011,9,"due to the explicit use-inspired nature of the work, the future research stemming from the agenda that the authors put forward here will be of benefit to decision makers and society more broadly"
2020-0011,10,"originality/value: this empirical research contributes to the discourse regarding the role of information and communication technologies in service in general, and the digital transformation on financial services in particular"
2020-0011,11,"the in-depth computational text-mining analysis is unbiased, replicable and provides the foundation for a use-inspired research agenda that is subsequently delineated"
2020-0056,0,"serverless computing is steadily becoming the implementation paradigm of choice for a variety of applications, from data analytics to web applications, as it addresses the main problems with serverfull and monolithic architecture"
2020-0056,1,"in particular, it abstracts away resource provisioning and infrastructure management, enabling developers to focus on the logic of the program instead of worrying about resource management which will be handled by cloud providers"
2020-0056,2,"in this paper, we consider a document processing system used in fintech as a case study and describe the migration journey from a monolithic architecture to a serverless architecture"
2020-0056,3,our evaluation results show that the serverless implementation significantly improves performance while resulting in only a marginal increase in cost
2020-0118,0,"the responsibility of the government is to protect all activities of its citizens, including activities about technology that are growing so fast, one of the problems is the increasing public interest in peer to peer online financial technology which encourages the enhancement of financial inclusion in indonesia"
2020-0118,1,this study analyse government regulations on financial services authority regulation no
2020-0118,2,"77/pojk.01/2016 concerning information technology-based lending and borrowing services, even though it has been regulated about lending and borrowing services, the government does not seem ready enough to faceagainst regulatory issues related to criminal acts related to the protection of personal data"
2020-0118,3,"basically, the problems that arise require the consequences of inter-agency or ministerial relations, for example in the ministry of communication and information (kemkominfo) with financial service authority institutions"
2020-0118,4,"through the method of statute approach, qualitatively, this study shows that the government needs to use the regulations of lexspecialis to protect customer data that is often misused by many loan service companies through online technology"
2020-0182,0,financial technology (fintech) is revolutionising the banking and finance sector at an inimitable pace
2020-0182,1,the concept of market and consumer has shifted dramatically to a new level as technology emerged in financial services industry
2020-0182,2,"however, such service is not familiar among the marginalised people as it involves technology and cost"
2020-0182,3,scheduled tribes in india have been viewed as the most distraught social group subject to age-old financial and social hardships
2020-0182,4,financial literacy on financial services has been shown to be a crucial factor in making effective decisions and choices regarding finance
2020-0182,5,this paper tries to examine both overall and category wise financial literacy of scheduled tribes in kerala with special emphasis on gender
2020-0182,6,it uses primary data of 393 tribal respondents from seven tribal communities across the most three tribally populated districts
2020-0182,7,"it observed that, there are disarrays in the use of fintech services among tribes"
2020-0182,8,the tribal community has not been able to find satisfactory literacy in fintech services
2020-0182,9,"but they have a healthy knowledge on other basic financial and banking services, and women often outperform men in this regard"
2020-0183,0,the expansion of information communication technology (ict) significantly influences organizations service delivering culture
2020-0183,1,"the financial institutions, particularly the banking industry are one of the major sectors that invests large amount of capital for introducing new technologies"
2020-0183,2,e-finance is one of the technology channels that bankers introduced to their customers to access financial services
2020-0183,3,"therefore, this study was aimed to study the effect of e-finance service quality on bank customers' fintech loyalty of using the e-finance services in future"
2020-0183,4,primary data was collected from 412 bank customers and it was analyzed using the structural equation model (sem) through amos
2020-0183,5,"the result revealed that both in normal operations of e-finance service and recovery services, the quality of service positively influences bank customers' satisfaction and their e-loyalty"
2020-0022,0,"a growing body of evidence suggests that financial literacy plays an important role in financial well-being, and that differences in financial knowledge acquired early in life can explain a significant part of financial and more general well-being in adult life"
2020-0022,1,financial technology (fintech) is revolutionising the financial services industry at an unrivalled pace
2020-0022,2,"views differ regarding the likely impact that fintech is likely to have on personal financial planning, well-being and societal welfare"
2020-0022,3,"in an era of mounting student debt, increased (digital) financial inclusion, and threats arising from instances of (online) financial fraud, financial education and enlightened financial advising appropriate policy interventions that enhance financial and overall well-being"
2020-0022,4,this special issue engages in this important academic and policy agenda by presenting a set of seven new papers emanating from four parallel streams of literature related to financial literacy and responsible finance
2020-0074,0,this article examines fintech as a systemic force disrupting the currently dominant technocratic paradigm of financial regulation
2020-0074,1,"it offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the key fintech-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and (ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of the regulatory enterprise as it exists today"
2020-0074,2,this exercise reveals the fundamental tension at the core of the fintech problem
2020-0074,3,"in the fintech era, the financial system as a whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and difficult to manage"
2020-0074,4,"the emerging regulatory responses to these macro-level changes, however, continue to operate primarily on the micro-level"
2020-0074,5,"surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate fintech, this article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design"
2020-0074,6,"against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of the fintech challenge- a nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively unified manner"
2020-0054,0,the digitalization of financial services opened a window for new players in the financial industry
2020-0054,1,"these start-ups take on tasks and functions previously reserved for banks, such as financing, asset management, and payments"
2020-0054,2,"in this article, we trace the transformation of the industry after digitalization"
2020-0054,3,"by using data on fintech formations in germany, we provide first evidence that entrepreneurial dynamics in the fintech sector are not so much driven by technology as by the educational and business background of the founders"
2020-0054,4,"furthermore, we investigate the reactions of traditional banks to the emergence of these start-ups"
2020-0054,5,"in contrast with other emerging industries such as biotechnology, a network analysis shows that fintechs have mostly engaged in strategic partnerships and only a few banks have acquired or obtained a financial interest in a fintech"
2020-0054,6,we explain the restraint of traditional banks to fully endorse the new possibilities of digitalized financial services with the characteristics of the technology itself and with the postponed fundamental decisions of banks to modernize their it infrastructure
2020-0120,0,"online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, once a marketplace teeming with retail investors, is now dominated by sophisticated institutional investors and banks"
2020-0120,1,this seismic shift in investor base has been coupled with significant growth for the legacy p2p lenders and new entrants
2020-0120,2,"a new regulatory approach is needed to grapple with these changes-one that focuses on consumer protection, as opposed to one that seeks to protect the sophisticated investors purchasing these loans"
2020-0120,3,"fortunately, such an approach is readily available in the office of the comptroller of the currency's fintech charter"
2020-0120,4,"this comment surveys the significant changes that have occurred in the p2p lending sector over the past ten years, as well as the risks and benefits to consumers attendant to the rapid growth in this relatively new form of lending"
2020-0120,5,"after surveying the current and proposed regulatory approaches toward p2p lending, this comment explains why a national fintech charter is the best approach to ensuring that consumers who rely on these loans receive the full protections guaranteed by federal law"
2020-0184,0,"similar to the internet, which created a revolution in the ability to communicate quickly and cheaply, fintech companies are using blockchain and digital wallets to create a revolution in the transfer of value across the world"
2020-0184,1,the literature and blog space to date have indicated that digital wallets could overtake the need for traditional banking
2020-0184,2,the purpose of this article is to provide further testing on whether fintech banking companies could overtake the need for traditional banking by evaluating whether the number of deposits at various us commercial banks and the growth of digital wallets have impacted us commercial bank market values over the past two to three years
2020-0184,3,results indicate a strong positive relationship between the number of deposits and us commercial bank market values and a strong negative relationship between digital wallet proxy measures and us commercial bank market values from 2017 to 2019
2020-0184,4,the trends indicate a stable amount of deposit in the us banking system to a slight decline versus a large growth in the digital wallet sphere
2020-0184,5,results indicate that digital wallets could create a large decrease in the market value of commercial banks in the future
2020-0184,6,such a result would indicate the need to consider carefully how fintech companies should be included in financial sector indices
2020-0072,0,"recent years have witnessed unprecedented growth in mobile payments, digital wallet being the latest trend"
2020-0072,1,these payments are very popular among young people in countries like china and india
2020-0072,2,"in this paper we shall explore the extent of spread of digital payment, especially the digital wallet payments"
2020-0072,3,in particular we shall study different aspects of digital payments in different region
2020-0072,4,finally we shall look at the extent of these payments and associated technologies in the kingdom of saudi arabia

2020-0057,0,fintech is the new revolution in finance and banking industry
2020-0057,1,"artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain and other advanced technologies have slowly found space in the banking world"
2020-0057,2,islamic banking is not untouched by these revolutions
2020-0057,3,bahrain is considered as the hub of islamic banking in the gcc and all over the world
2020-0057,4,bahrain has the largest concentration of islamic banks in the world
2020-0057,5,the main objective of this study is to find the impact of agility and fintech on the future of islamic banking in bahrain
2020-0057,6,the research has used mainly secondary data for its study
2020-0057,7,the study concludes that the fintech has potential impact on the future of islamic banking
2020-0057,8,there was a reluctant on the part of islamic banks to adopt fintech
2020-0057,9,they treated fintech as more of a competitor than the partners
2020-0057,10,"the islamic banks now must understand to be agile, competitive and aggressive"
2020-0057,11,the study indicated many points which highlights the necessity on the part of islamic banks to be agile and adopt fintech as partners
2020-0186,0,fintech has been a pivotal force behind most of the transition taking place in the financial arena in india and worldwide in last few years
2020-0186,1,it is potentially one of the game changing disruptive forces which have transformed the financial ecosystem leveraging the throughput of banking and financial services
2020-0186,2,"the advent of financial technology has given much needed impetus to the otherwise struggling financial institutions, which have been able to cut down a lot on redundant costs"
2020-0186,3,"resultantly, the institutions have been able to maximise operating efficiency and reduce costs to a large extent"
2020-0186,4,the technology backed financial landscape has been improved over a period of time with results being evident in its profitability and other allied ratios
2020-0186,5,this research paper discusses a probable role which financial technology has played in the profitability of the financial institutions specifically banks in indian context
2020-0004,0,"we argue financial technology (fintech) is the key driver for financial inclusion, which in turn underlies sustainable balanced development, as embodied in the un sustainable development goals (sdgs)"
2020-0004,1,the full potential of fintech to support the sdgs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation
2020-0004,2,our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars
2020-0004,3,"the first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-kyc systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems"
2020-0004,4,the third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments
2020-0004,5,the fourth pillardesign of digital financial markets and systemssupports broader access to finance and investment
2020-0004,6,"implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through fintech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development"
2020-0023,0,this study aims to assess why users are willing/hesitant to continue using fintech services based on their perceived benefits and risks pertaining to the use of fintech technology
2020-0023,1,"data was collected, using an adopted survey instrument, from bankers based in bahrain, the financial and fintech hub of the middle east"
2020-0023,2,data analysis was applied to assess the reliability and validity of this study's conceptual model along with its nine hypotheses with 374 valid responses subsequently being analysed using multiple regression via spss version 23
2020-0023,3,"the empirical findings of this study supported all the hypotheses, revealing that both perceived benefit and risks affect the intent to continue using fintech"
2020-0023,4,"perceived benefit has a stronger effect than the perceived risk, and convenience perceived most beneficial while financial risk perceived riskiest for using fintech technology by the bankers of bahrain"
2020-0119,0,modern applications of fintech are challenged by enormous volumes of financial data
2020-0119,1,one way to handle these is to adopt a streaming setting where data are only available to the algorithms during a very short time
2020-0119,2,"when a new data point (financial transaction) is generated, it needs to be processed directly, and be forgotten immediately after"
2020-0119,3,"especially, ongoing globalization efforts in fintech require modern methods of fault detection to be able to work efficiently through more than 10 000 financial transactions per second if they are to be deployed as a first line of defence"
2020-0119,4,this article investigates two algorithms able to perform well in this demanding setting: k-means and fado
2020-0119,5,"especially, this article provides supports for the claim that the use of multiple clusters does not necessarily translate into increased detection performance"
2020-0119,6,"to support this claim, results are reported when operating in a quasi-realistic case study of anti money laundering (aml) detection in real-time payment systems"
2020-0119,7,"we focus on two prototypical algorithms: the passive aggressive fado assuming a single cluster, and the well-known k-means algorithm working with k> clusters"
2020-0119,8,"we find-in this case-that the use of k-means with multiple clusters is unfavorable as 1) both tuning for k, as well as the need for additional complexity in the k-means algorithm challenges the computational constraints"
2020-0119,9,2) k-means introduces necessarily added variability (unreliability) in the results
2020-0119,10,"3) it requires dimensionality reduction, compromising interpretability of the detections"
2020-0119,11,4) the prevalence of singleton clusters adds unreliability to the outcome
2020-0119,12,this makes in the presented case fado favorable over k-means (with k>1)
2020-0001,0,"this paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap in the existing literature on bitcoin, blockchain and fintech"
2020-0001,1,it begins by clarifying the definition of these concepts
2020-0001,2,"through a systematic review and case studies in the supply chain industry, this paper brings out the applications, the benefits/value, and the challenges/issues of bitcoin, blockchain and fintech in several industries"
2020-0001,3,it also presents the research methodologies/approaches used during such research
2020-0001,4,the classification framework developed and used to perform an analysis of 141 articles from five top academic databases serves as a baseline study
2020-0001,5,"it offers the opportunity to evaluate the level of knowledge on bitcoin, blockchain and fintech, and their evolution over time"
2020-0001,6,"the findings show that these technologies are evolving, and organizations are embracing them for competitive advantage"
2020-0001,7,"thus, organizations need to leverage research on these technologies to better understand them, optimize their business strategies, and develop critical insights for decision-making"
2020-0059,0,this paper investigates the role of financial technology (fintech) in propelling economic growth in indonesia from 1998 to 2018
2020-0059,1,"the fintech industry employs a technology-based business model to provide financial services, including lending, payment, investment, and financing services"
2020-0059,2,"the study is motivated by endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain technology as the most important driver of economic growth"
2020-0059,3,the study finds that fintech startups are positively correlated with indonesias economic growth
2020-0059,4,"fintech firms in their first year are found to be disruptive, but they fail to have serious consequences on indonesias economic growth"
2020-0059,5,"however, they seem to significantly encourage economic growth in their second year"
2020-0059,6,"these findings are derived after accounting for other important growth determinants, namely, capital per labor, foreign direct investment (fdi), stock market development, and trade openness"
2020-0036,0,"purpose: financial technology innovation within the developed world is driving financial markets, yet its adoption is lagging among consumers in emerging markets"
2020-0036,1,"at the same time, most african economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption"
2020-0036,2,"given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in south africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency"
2020-0036,3,"design/methodology/approach: a survey instrument based on the tpb was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the mancosa, cape town campus"
2020-0036,4,"for data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used"
2020-0036,5,findings: the findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency
2020-0036,6,subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence
2020-0036,7,"overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory"
2020-0036,8,research limitations/implications: the results of this study may not be generalisable to the wider population as it is only based on a cross-sectional study of a sample of adult students at a single institute in south africa
2020-0036,9,"originality/value: the contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in south africa using the tpb model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption"
2020-0036,10,studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour
2020-0098,0,the fintech industry is the convergence of the financial industry and the ict (information and communications technology) industry
2020-0098,1,"it not only replaces the services provided by traditional financial services such as remittances, settlements, and asset management, but also creates new industries combined with ict technology such as cloud funding, p2p, and internet professional bank"
2020-0098,2,"therefore, this research focuses on the economic ripple effect of the fintech industry on the national economy by inter-industrial analysis"
2020-0098,3,"at the same time, in order to learn the different circumstances of fintech industry worldwide, this study conducted comparative research on fintech leading countries in the united states and china with south korea"
2020-0098,4,"all the economic ripple effects of south korea, china, and the united states fintech industry are relatively low among all industries, and the industrial characteristics are analyzed to be 'intermediate primary production' type industry"
2020-0098,5,"this study, as the first attempt, analyzes the current economic impact of fintech in each country, and inspires future development direction of fintech industrial policy"
2020-0099,0,"agent-based modeling, with its unique ""god's perspective"", is widely influencing traditional economic and financial research"

2020-0099,2,"in particular, in the fields of big data ontology research, agent-based model calibration, investor behavior modeling, regulatory technology applications, etc., agent-based modeling has demonstrated its unique advantages in integrating with fintech"
2020-0099,3,"from the perspectives of big data ontology, agent-based modeling is an effective method that uses financial big data ontology modeling to depict the correlation between financial entities and to study their causal relationships"
2020-0099,4,"from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, it provides the basis for fine modeling of individuals and behavioral evolution modeling, and agent-based modeling provides a new research frame-work for algorithmic trading"
2020-0099,5,"from the perspectives of regulatory technology, the agent-based model in the development process to promote the formation of a new 'scenario-response' type of risk management, thus providing supports for the 'regulatory technology' development"
2020-0099,6,"this paper holds that agent-based modeling can be integrated with the basic supporting technologies of fintech, providing an important impetus for the development of agent-based modeling and regulatory innovation in fintech"
2020-0187,0,this research aims to analyze the role of financial technology (fintech) on sharia banking in indonesia
2020-0187,1,"the technology-based financial services company in indonesia grows faster, resulting in the disruption of financial services companies, including sharia banks"
2020-0187,2,several studies have discussed the opportunity of cooperation between sharia banks and fintech companies to increase the market share of sharia banks and to write economic inclusion.in the study used methods of descriptive analysis with secondary data and literature studies
2020-0187,3,the findings in this study are that sharia banks in the economic disruption era have a greater challenge in achieving target market share
2020-0187,4,the cooperation opportunities with fintech companies also have challenges in terms of legal certainty and sharia aspect direction
2020-0187,5,"however, fintech is expected to help sharia banks reach its market share target"
2020-0187,6,this research provides the right cooperation solution that sharia banks can do with fintech companies

2020-0006,10,"system automation, big data analysis, huge cost savings (by increasing the efficiency and decreasing in errors), increased reliability in financial reports, and reduced workflow"
2020-0006,11,"the research paper comes to present how artificial intelligence combine financial information with tech capabilities, accelerate digital transformation of finance and accounting, and may create a more safety business and economic environment, reducing human error"
2020-0006,12,we have to manage our work and time differently
2020-0006,13,"we are living in a digital and intelligent era, where machines take over repetitive, time-consuming and redundant tasks, giving finance professionals more time to approach higher level and more lucrative analysis and research"
2020-0071,0,"purpose: using data from world bank and global islamic finance report, this paper aims to compare the performance of countries following islamic and conventional finance system in terms of financial inclusion and fintech"
2020-0071,1,design/methodology/approach: ten countries from both financial systems have been selected based on the presence of islamic finance and conventional finance in the country
2020-0071,2,data was analyzed from year 2011 to 2017 and keeping the former as base year to measure the change in the population fraction
2020-0071,3,findings: the findings found that islamic finance countries are more inclusive in terms of financial inclusion and women are financially more empowered as compared to the counterpart
2020-0071,4,"on the contrary, countries with conventional finance have a higher number of fintech users"
2020-0071,5,research limitations/implications: the difference between the performances of two systems in terms of financial inclusion is relatively small
2020-0071,6,"therefore, future studies should incorporate more indicators for financial inclusion"
2020-0071,7,"originality/value: this study will be useful for understanding the nature of both financial systems, and the further research can be done to find the determinants of financial inclusion"
2020-0188,0,"micro, small, and medium enterprises (msmes) are increasingly growing with the development of technology, where msmes are one of the pillars of the strength of the indonesian economy"

2020-0201,0,purpose: this paper aims to investigate the effects of eliminating riba in foreign currency transactions
2020-0201,1,riba or interest arises when foreign currencies are bought and sold at different rates
2020-0201,2,"from the islamic perspective, the difference between the buying and selling rates of foreign exchange will constitute riba"
2020-0201,3,"also, this paper examines the effects of eliminating such riba on major macroeconomic variables"
2020-0201,4,"design/methodology/approach: this study is based on the hadith which imply that if buying and selling rates of currencies or foreign exchanges are same, i.e"
2020-0201,5,"if one sells bd1 = dh10 and dh10 = bd1 on spot, there will be no riba"
2020-0201,6,"this can be guaranteed if the islamic banking system introduces the technology, often known as fintech interest-free foreign exchange bank machines (iffexbm), which will automatically dispense bd10 for dh100 and vice-versa, both locally and globally, and it will have tremendous positive effects in the economy"
2020-0201,7,"furthermore, the effects of introducing fintech for eliminating riba will be analyzed on economic and international trade activities by using aggregate expenditure (ae) and aggregate output model within the tenets of islamic principles"
2020-0201,8,"findings: if islamic banks (ibs) can introduce fintech global network system where any client can buy or sell foreign currency at the same rate without any markup, it will increase the market share for ibs by increasing the number of customers and number of branches, and it will increase the inflow of funds and volumes of transactions, especially in international trade, global financial transactions and cross-border shopping"
2020-0201,9,such an increase in transactions will increase ae and ae will continuously shift up
2020-0201,10,"such an upward shift will have positive effects on equilibrium output, employment and prosperity"
2020-0201,11,"originality/value: this is, perhaps, one of the latest attempts to eliminate riba from foreign exchange transactions by introducing fintech iffexbm in each and every locality"
2020-0201,12,"such elimination of riba will not only reduce the cost of cross-border transactions but it will also reduce cost in international trade and financial transactions among nations, and therefore, it will have expansionary effects on equilibrium output, employment and global prosperity"

2020-0051,3,"the results of analysis allowed us to suggest that among main scenarios of fintech development the most probable is the splitting of existing market, which in the future can turn into a market of digital transnational financial corporations, which will squeeze out both small companies and traditional financial giants"
2020-0051,4,"however, although the scenario of capturing the financial market by large players is currently unlikely, it is certainly more important in terms of the consequences for global markets"
2020-0051,5,the main prerequisite for the latter scenario is the promotion of international cooperation in the regulation of digital financial companies
2020-0051,6,such a condition requires new models of country-level interaction in the regulation of innovative financial companies in order to address the risks and challenges of different scenarios of fintech development on global financial markets
2020-0051,7,"this article includes a comparative analysis of digital development in russia and the republic of korea, which is one of the key players on the asian fintech market, as a possible benchmark that can be used to shape the policies of intergovernmental cooperation on global financial markets"
2020-0051,8,these policies include 1) regulatory cooperation that reduces risks due to growing experience in the regulation of innovative financial companies
2020-0051,9,"2)cooperation in investments that allow one to acquire additional experience in regulatory practices and to develop infrastructure, which meets the new requirements of digital finance"
2020-0051,10,and 3) cooperation in the taxation of fintech companies that reduces cross-border regulatory arbitrage
2020-0068,0,"the rapid increase in the number of fintech companies in indonesia in the past three years has attracted the attention of many stakeholders, including the government, investors, conventional bank management, and even the general public"
2020-0068,1,the phenomenon of the development of peer-to-peer lending fintech companies in indonesia is supported by the increasing demand of consumers
2020-0068,2,"the research objective is to provide insight into the determinants of consumer interest in using fintech applications, using the technology acceptance model by added e-trust variables"
2020-0068,3,the data analysis method used structural equation modeling with warppls 6.0 software
2020-0068,4,"questionnaires were distributed to fintech consumers in indonesia, with a total sample of 379 respondents"
2020-0068,5,"the results of this study indicate that the dimensions of e-trust contribute to determining the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude to adopt peer-to-peer lending fintech services, and intention to use peer-to-peer lending applications"
2020-0085,0,growing fintech entrepreneurship is a recent global phenomenon
2020-0085,1,"drawing on the national innovation systems framework, we examine how countries venture capital (vc) and credit markets differently affect fintech entrepreneurship across countries"
2020-0085,2,"we argue that with their established and globally diffused norms and practices, vc investorsbut not banksrequire a critical mass of fintech entrepreneurship in a country to more positively influence fintech entrepreneurship"
2020-0085,3,"moreover, we argue that vc and credit markets are substitutes, especially in countries with more fintech entrepreneurship"
2020-0085,4,"using quantile regressions on data from 53 countries, we find support for our hypotheses"
2020-0202,0,"little is known about racial patterns in fintech mortgage lending, despite evidence of racial disparities in the broader mortgage market"
2020-0202,1,this study leverages 20152017 home mortgage disclosure act data to assess disparities in lending outcomes between white and non-white applicants and between neighborhoods of varying racial composition in the united states 200 largest metropolitan areas at fintech and traditional lenders
2020-0202,2,"results of a series of binary logistic regression models suggest disparities in rates of loan approvals between white and similarly qualified non-white applicants are substantively small overall, but lower at fintech lenders relative to traditional lenders, most substantially for latinos"
2020-0202,3,"non-white applicants are more likely to receive subprime terms relative to similarly qualified white applicants at both lender types, and disparities in rates of subprime loan receipt between black and similarly qualified white applicants are greater at fintech lenders than traditional lenders"
2020-0202,4,neighborhood racial composition has a mixed but substantively small impact on approval rates at both lender types
2020-0202,5,"however, both lender types distribute subprime credit to non-white neighborhoods at significantly higher rates than to white neighborhoods"
2020-0202,6,findings suggest fintech lending contributes to racial and spatial disparities in subprime mortgage lending and warrants increased scrutiny from regulators
2020-0126,0,the popularity and potential of fintech for generating business value has been highlighted in an evolving number of studies
2020-0126,1,"nevertheless, there is still ambiguity on the success of such disruptive technologies"
2020-0126,2,"to address this gap, this paper draws on a case study of an it vendor in japan"
2020-0126,3,"we interview key stakeholders involved in the case project to (i) explore the success factors of fintech applications adopted by non-financial organisations, (ii) illustrate the applicability of the multi-dimensional project success framework in fintech projects, and (iii) highlight the importance of the fintech project management field that warrants further investigation"
2020-0126,4,"we contribute to the it project management field, where we extend the theoretical background with aspects of fintech adoption and success"
2020-0126,5,we also inform practice in terms of lessons for managers to improve the existing processes and assist their organisations in business transformational initiatives using fintech

2020-0203,1,"specifically, the chapter investigates the role of disruptive financial technology in financial inclusion, focusing on mobile money transactions on entrepreneurship"
2020-0203,2,looking at the role of digital money on entrepreneurship matters greatly because self-employment is a sustainable route out of poverty
2020-0203,3,the study shows that the use of mobile money technology is not necessarily for investment purposes and to make livelihood changes by investing in the creation of new enterprises or self-employment ventures
2020-0203,4,"most of the current use of mobile money is for transaction payments, such as utility bills and/or payment of fees, like tuition fees"
2020-0086,0,"what has boosted crowdfundings growth? in the case of peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, we highlight the role of consumers distrust in banks"
2020-0086,1,we offer evidence that distrust in banks likely triggers individuals to supply funding toward crowdfunding and away from bank deposits
2020-0086,2,"we highlight that a distrust mindset promotes questioning default choices and considering alternatives, and fosters comparisons focusing on dissimilarities"
2020-0086,3,"our findings suggest us states whose residents express greater distrust in banks are more likely to fund p2p loans and, conditional on funding, lend higher amounts"
2020-0086,4,this relationship is more pronounced when funding small loans or borrowers with less banking access
2020-0128,0,aim/purpose this study aimed to examine the effect of marketing knowledge management (mkm) on bank performance via the mediating role of the fintech innovation in jordanian commercial banks
2020-0128,1,"background an extensive number of studies found a significant relationship between marketing knowledge management and bank performance (e.g., akroush & al-mohammad, 2010"
2020-0128,2,hou & chien 2010
2020-0128,3,"rezaee & jafari, 2015"
2020-0128,4,"veismoradi et al., 2013)"
2020-0128,5,"however, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between marketing knowledge management (mkm) and bank performance (bp)"
2020-0128,6,"furthermore, the linkage between mkm and bp is not straightforward but, instead, includes a more complicated relationship"
2020-0128,7,"therefore, it is argued that managing marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities can enhance performance via the role of financial innovation as a mediating factor on commercial banks"
2020-0128,8,"to date, however, there is no empirical evidence"
2020-0128,9,"methodology based on a literature review, knowledge-based theory, and financial innovation theory, an integrated conceptual framework has been developed to guide the study"
2020-0128,10,"a quantitative approach was used, and the data was collected from 336 managers and employees in all 13 jordanian commercial banks using online and in hand instruments"
2020-0128,11,structural equation modeling (sem) was used to analyze and verify the study variables
2020-0128,12,contribution this article contributes to theory by filling a gap in the literature regarding the role of marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities in commercial banks operating in a developing country like jordan
2020-0128,13,it empirically examined and validated the role of fintech innovation as mediators between marketing knowledge management and bank performance findings the main findings revealed that marketing knowledge management had a significant favorable influence on bank performance
2020-0128,14,fintech innovation acted as partial mediators in this relationship
2020-0128,15,recommendations commercial banks should be fully aware of the importance of knowledge man-for practitioners agement practices to enhance their financial innovation and bank performance
2020-0128,16,they should also consider promoting a culture of practicing knowledge management processes among their managers and employees by motivating and training to promote innovations
2020-0128,17,"recommendations the result endorsed fintech innovation's mediating effect on the relationship for researchers between the independent variable, marketing knowledge management (assets and capabilities), and the dependent variable bank performance, which was not addressed before"
2020-0128,18,"thus, it needs further validation"
2020-0128,19,"future research the current designed research model can be applied and assessed further in other sectors, including banking and industrial sectors across developed and developing countries"
2020-0128,20,"it would also be of interest to introduce other variables in the study model that can act as consequences of mkm capabilities, such as financial and non-financial performance measures"
2020-0204,0,"due to information asymmetry in the lending market, credit activities inevitably cause pre- and post-loan risk in banks"
2020-0204,1,"to explore whether these risks can be alleviated by fintech and study its specific mechanism from the perspective of managers, we investigate on a sample from the establishment of fintech subsidiaries in chinese commercial banks during 20142018"
2020-0204,2,"the results show that fintech can alleviate pre-loan risk associated with credit activities, and this negative effect is more pronounced in banks with higher level of managerial ownership"
2020-0204,3,"as the control of post-loan risk is more dependent on the regulators, fintech in banks has no significant effect on reducing post-loan risk associated with credit activities"

2020-0034,4,"for the analytical method, the authors used multivariate regression to estimate the research model"
2020-0034,5,research results show that fintech service is very important for the banking sector in vietnam
2020-0034,6,"moreover, this paper has achieved great success by identifying the factors that influence customers' intention to use fintech services"
2020-0034,7,"accordingly, the intention to use fintech (int) services is positively affected by the perception of usefulness (pu), social impact (si), customer trust (tru), and perceived ease of use (peu)"
2020-0034,8,"based on the results of this study, bank managers will have a basis to improve the quality of fintech services"

2020-0035,0,this essay examines the current transformation of the chinese financial sector and the implications of chinese financial technology (fintech) development for countries in southeast asia
2020-0035,1,main argument china is home to some of the world's most innovative fintech companies
2020-0035,2,chinese fintech companies have been successful in promoting financial inclusion and integration in their home country and are attempting to replicate this success in southeast asian markets
2020-0035,3,"the rapid development of the chinese fintech industry can be attributed to various factors, including a high degree of technological savvy among chinese consumers, underdeveloped banking systems, a fintech-friendly regulatory environment, and china's improving scientific and technological prowess"
2020-0035,4,"chinese technology companies are also successfully exporting their programs and technology to southeast asia, where many markets have a comparable base for new financial technologies"
2020-0035,5,geographic proximity as well as ethnic and cultural connections between china and southeast asia are also major facilitators that can help chinese fintech companies succeed in the region
2020-0035,6,policy implications  strict data privacy laws and regulations requiring control and scrutiny of inbound foreign investments prevent chinese firms from engaging with western and other advanced markets
2020-0035,7,"due to the absence of these constraints in southeast asian markets, china's fintech firms are emerging as major competitors"
2020-0035,8,"many chinese fintech programs perform poorly with regard to security and privacy practices, which should be an issue of concern as they gain access to new markets"
2020-0035,9,chinese technology firms operating in southeast asia could be pressured by the chinese government to carry out censorship
2020-0035,10,"for example, wechat, used for messaging, social media, and mobile payments, has been accused of censorship activities in southeast asia and other foreign markets"
2020-0035,11,"western and other advanced economies such as japan must make special efforts to bring institutional changes to southeast asian markets for fintech products, especially in the areas of data privacy, cybersecurity, and surveillance"
2020-0035,12,there is a need for closer collaboration with like-minded governments on standards and consumer awareness of privacy and surveillance risks
2020-0035,13,"if consumers understand such risks, they are more likely to prefer fintech services provided by japanese and western firms"
2020-0079,0,this study examines the effect of fintech on retail banks stock return listed in indonesia stock exchange for the period of 2016-2018 as today's new technology lead to the emergence of fintech companies playing the same role as retail banks in the financial industry
2020-0079,1,"this study is conducted quantitatively using monthly data from january 2016 to october 2018 and uses fintech as independent variable, proxied by fintech funding frequency and fintech funding value"
2020-0079,2,data transformation is conducted due to data volatility
2020-0079,3,"the data of fintech funding, both frequency and value, is transformed into standardized fintech funding and growth of fintech funding"
2020-0079,4,"the data is obtained from crunchbase, while the data of stock returns is obtained from investing"
2020-0079,5,this study further analyzes the data using fama french three-factor model and panel data regression
2020-0079,6,we found that fintech has no significant effect on retail banks' stock returns listed in indonesia stock exchange for the period of 2016-2018
2020-0079,7,the findings of the study provide some useful insights in understanding fintech companies' current position to retail banks in indonesia
2020-0079,8,"this study also suggests banking institutions, fintech companies, policy-makers, and others to take advantageous steps in building inclusive financial sectors"
2020-0207,0,transition countries experienced massive emigration after the fall of the soviet union
2020-0207,1,many of them currently rely on remittances from abroad
2020-0207,2,"the number of remittances services providers is constantly growing, some studies speak about the uberisation of the remittances market"
2020-0207,3,"the paper focuses on six case countries: armenia, georgia, moldova, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan and ukraine"
2020-0207,4,it assesses the potential and current penetration of mobile money services on their remittance market
2020-0207,5,the paper finds the remittance market in the case countries to be highly competitive in terms of costs and variety of rsps
2020-0207,6,"telco operators from the case countries have expanded their services towards certain bank-like and mobile money-like services, but the only true mobile money service so far is present in armenia"
2020-0207,7,current portfolios of services offered by telco operators suggests that remittances inflows from russia are important for future development of mobile money
2020-0207,8,"the remittance market is thus important for mobile money development, but low costs are not the only enabling factor for these services"
2020-0207,9,"other important aspects are convenience, accessibility, speed, transparency of rates, etc"
2020-0207,10,"further development of mobile money in the case countries is highly probable, but it will most likely not be so intense as in other asian and african countries"
2020-0208,0,financial technology (fin tech) as a financial product and service through a combination of technology platforms and innovative business models
2020-0208,1,the development of fin tech encouraged ojk to issue a financial services authority regulation regarding lending and borrowing based on information technology
2020-0208,2,this regulation is expected to encourage alternative financing for the community
2020-0208,3,support the growth of technology-based financial services institutions to contribute to the national economy
2020-0208,4,"ojk regulation number: 77/pojk.01/2016 concerning information technology-based loan services only regulates peer to peer (p2p) lending activities, so that other fin tech models such as: non-financial crowd funding"
2020-0208,5,direct balance sheet or e-commerce loan
2020-0208,6,traditional credit rating and crowd funding security are not included in the scope of this regulatory arrangement
2020-0208,7,"based on legal relations, there is only an agreement between the lender and the borrower, while the provider does not include the parties in the agreement"
2020-0208,8,"in this case, when that happens, the most vulnerable party is the lender"
2020-0208,9,"therefore, it is necessary to provide clear legal protection for lenders"
2020-0209,0,the development of new technologies by financial service providers is not new
2020-0209,1,"banks, for instance, have always utilized technology to improve front- and back-office operations"
2020-0209,2,"the historical significance of fintech does not derive from the use of technology per se, but the leveraging of the distinct properties of digital technologies by non-traditional actors to offer consumers a better experience of financial services"
2020-0209,3,"more specifically, the goal of overcoming friction in the user experience is here identified as the core feature driving many recent developments in a fintech context"
2020-0209,4,this chapter explores the implications of such an account for incumbent financial institutions and regulators
2020-0209,5,"from the perspective of incumbents, this new emphasis on the consumer experience requires banks and other financial institutions to organize-for-innovation"
2020-0209,6,"new capacities and a shift in mindset are needed to deliver a different kind of user experience, and two effective strategies for incumbents are explored"
2020-0209,7,"first, adopting more decentralized forms of organization and governancewhat we refer to as decentralized ecosystemsthat are better placed to innovate and overcome friction"
2020-0209,8,"second, adopting a more strategic approach to venturing, i.e., purchasing start-ups from the fintech sector and integrating their innovations into incumbent operations"
2020-0209,9,"from a regulatory perspective, this requires a greater willingness on the part of regulators and other policymakers to foster experimentation in financial services"
2020-0209,10,"as such, the goal of regulation needs to shift from a traditional focus on managing systemic risk to more dynamic models that seek to facilitate responsible innovation and the delivery of a better-quality user experience"
2020-0209,11,"this can be achieved, for example, by state regulators working togetherpartneringwith incumbents and start-ups in the financial service ecosystems of the future via regulatory sandboxes and other similar schemes"
2020-0209,12,regulatory developments in asia and europe provide some evidence that policymakers recognize the need for such a shift in emphasis
2020-0209,13,"however, doubts remain about whether they have gone far enough in pursuing this goal and that the full benefits of the fintech revolution have been realized"
2020-0129,0,"a regulatory sandbox is a safe space in which businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms without immediately incurring all the normal regulatory consequences of engaging in the activity in question"
2020-0129,1,"the fundamental purpose of the regulatory sandbox is to facilitate the development of fintech, especially the disruptive innovation activities of the start-up enterprises"
2020-0129,2,"in this sense, the regulatory sandbox is a sub-category of the regulation of fintech"
2020-0129,3,"fintech is technology-enabled financial innovation, synonymous with the term internet finance in the chinese context"
2020-0129,4,"a different but related term, the regulatory technology (regtech), in a broad sense refers to a combination of the compliance technology by the market players with the regulatory technology by the regulators"
2020-0129,5,"in nature, the regulatory sandbox is conditional, limited, and controlled deregulation"
2020-0129,6,"it was primarily a reaction to the somehow overly burdensome regulatory requirements after the global financial crisis (gfc), thus leaving a lifeline for financial innovation and, in particular, fintech"
2020-0129,7,"the situation is very different in china, where the major problem for internet finance it not over-regulation but under-regulation"
2020-0129,8,"with a vast territory, diversified areas, and numerous institutions, china does not feature a much developed and high concentrated financial market like that of the uk, singapore, or the hk sar"
2020-0129,9,nor does it have an integrated financial regulatory system
2020-0129,10,"and, most importantly, the existing mechanisms in china are capable of performing equivalent or even more functions than the sandbox, which, if copied in china, would be redundant"
2020-0129,11,"in short, the regulatory sandbox is admittedly a remarkable innovation in terms of regulatory ideas and approaches conducive to financial innovation, especially fintech"
2020-0129,12,"however, with its specific background, exterior conditions, and intrinsic limitations, it is by no means an inevitable choice or universal model for the regulation of fintech"
2020-0129,13,"based on the actual circumstances, its not desirable for china to introduce the sandbox, at least for the time being"
2020-0130,0,this chapter introduces the problem of horizontal shareholding in the fintech sector in asia
2020-0130,1,"a great deal of the fintech debate surrounds grab and go-jek, two ridesharing platforms that are aggressively expanding their business geographically and product-wise"
2020-0130,2,"to finance the expansion, these firms rely on various investors"
2020-0130,3,these investors do often not limit their interest in these two firms but also become shareholders in firms offering the same products
2020-0130,4,"this form of shareholding, also known as horizontal shareholding, is increasingly characterizing the fintech scene in asia"
2020-0130,5,this triggers the question on how this phenomenon should be approached from a competition law perspective
2020-0130,6,horizontal shareholding indeed facilitates the flow of information between competitors or enables control over the executives of competing firms
2020-0130,7,the issue is still controversial as there is disagreement on the effects of horizontal shareholding and on how competition law should be applied to the issue
2020-0130,8,"however, there is an understanding that further research is warranted"
2020-0130,9,"part of this research, this chapter argues, should not be on direct price increase due to horizontal shareholding"
2020-0130,10,the international character of the horizontal shareholding in the asian fintech sector requires a rethinking of the possible anticompetitive effects
2020-0130,11,this chapter claims that such an effect may be market division
2020-0130,12,enforcement may be a difficult issue
2020-0130,13,"however, when a merger occurs in this sector, enforcement authorities should pay close attention to the issue of horizontal shareholding"
2020-0210,0,fintech has been a buzzword in japan since 2015
2020-0210,1,"the fintech business model in japan is similar as in other countries: crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, blockchain, ai, big data, and cashless payments"
2020-0210,2,"what has been the largest impact of fintech in japan? at first glance, fintech seems to require a change in the financial regulation framework, but this is not the case"
2020-0210,3,"in japan, traditional financial regulation is piecemeal or trident, with a separate legislative framework for banking, insurance, and securities"
2020-0210,4,this framework is not unreasonable because it is designed to respond to different risks
2020-0210,5,"of course, some other new financial businesses appeared before fintech, and regulation responded to the new risk"
2020-0210,6,fintech is not a completely new business but just the unbundling of current financial businesses
2020-0210,7,"especially, payment became more independent from banking today, thanks to the fintech movement"
2020-0210,8,"therefore, regulation just for payment is required more clearly"
2020-0210,9,"currently, the fsa is planning to create a new category of regulation for it"
2020-0210,10,it seems fintech requires a change in the basic framework of financial law
2020-0210,11,"but both in practice and in theory, a pure payment service has attracted attention before fintech"
2020-0210,12,"therefore, fintech, or any other technological innovation, does not require a complete change of regulation but a clarification of current law"
2020-0211,0,"after reviewing the financial regulatory system and market structure in korea, this chapter examines the recent development of fintech in the area of banking, capital markets, and payment services"
2020-0211,1,"in the banking sector, the main focus is on the development of internet-only banking"
2020-0211,2,"under the strict regulations on the separation of financial capital and industrial capital, technological companies entry into the banking business causes serious banking law debates"
2020-0211,3,"in capital markets, the application of the fintech model in capital markets such as equity and debt-based crowdfunding and robo-advisors is widely discussed"
2020-0211,4,easy payment & remittance and crypto-assets are a concern for both legal practitioners and the business sector
2020-0211,5,the legal character and function of crypto-assets is also a significant issue in korea
2020-0211,6,"in korea, institutional efforts to introduce new financial products and services in accordance with the combination of technology and finance are being developed in various fields such as banking and securities"
2020-0211,7,particularly noteworthy is the introduction of new means of payment
2020-0211,8,"the regulatory sandbox newly introduced by korea will have an impact on the korean financial regulatory system, which has traditionally been very conservative"
2020-0211,9,this chapter is based on the law of korea as of 30 june 2019
2020-0212,0,"in the context of a fast-developing, technology-driven economy, policymakers increasingly regard regulation as an essential element in gaining a competitive edge and establishing themselves as a regional hub for technology-focused businesses"
2020-0212,1,"in the context, of fintech, for example, a number of asian jurisdictions have recently introduced regulatory reforms that aim at filling gaps in existing legislation or resolving uncertainties"
2020-0212,2,"such legal reforms are motivated by the desire to encourage the development of fintech, while also ensuring that vital public interests are adequately protected"
2020-0212,3,this book is a preliminary attempt to map some of these legal developments in an asian context via a series of case studies focused on key jurisdictions
2020-0212,4,"here, by way of introduction to the substantive chapters that follow, we briefly review the disruption of incumbents and the new opportunities that have been triggered by the emergence of fintech and summarize the chapters and regulatory reforms that different jurisdictions have introduced"
2020-0212,5,common themes across all chapters are a recognition of the importance of fintech in the future development of financial services and the importance of more flexible regulatory forms that provide the freedom for all stakeholders to bring new financial technologies to the market
2020-0213,0,"in the 4th industrial revolution, the upsurged trend of financial services of non-banking institutions and the intersection of financial services and technology have shaped fintech companies"
2020-0213,1,"such businesses have advantages in technology, deliver financial solutions with modern technologies, and provide customers with a highly accessible and streamlined path to fulfill their financial needs"
2020-0213,2,"vietnam has been considered as a potentially lucrative market for fintech as it has a young and tech-savvy population, high mobile phone and internet penetration rates, and relatively low levels of financial inclusion"
2020-0213,3,"although its fintech market is still fledgling, more than 150 companies have joined with increasing transaction volumes and high growth rates"
2020-0213,4,"they have provided customers with financial and banking services such as digital payment, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, remittance, blockchain, personal finance management, and information comparison with modern technologies, lower costs, and more straightforward procedures"
2020-0213,5,"also, the country has been making an effort to spur the development of fintech companies by setting up a fintech steering committee, preparing the national financial inclusion strategy, and cautiously seeking the best approach to regulate fintech"
2020-0213,6,this chapter examines the use of fintech to facilitate socio-economic development in vietnam and considers the appropriate regulatory framework to achieve such a goal
2020-0131,0,"this chapter examines the rise of fintech, its regulation, and the particular challenges these present for an international financial center (ifc), specifically an ifc with limited economic breadth"
2020-0131,1,"fintech offers automation opportunities for financial institutions, and such automation will in most cases make banks more competitive and lower their labor needs"
2020-0131,2,"the hong kong government has actively embraced fintech to ensure competitiveness, and its regulation tracks leading international positions on icos, cryptocurrency and electronic payment"
2020-0131,3,"however, hong kong regulators have not facilitated fintech activities that would stimulate the local economy, such as equity crowdfunding"
2020-0131,4,"automation will generally translate into a reduction of human labor, particularly in mid-level jobs"
2020-0131,5,"in a large and varied economy, persons laid off from jobs at banks can seek engagement elsewhere"
2020-0131,6,this is not necessarily true in an ifc with a less diversified economy
2020-0131,7,hong kong presents the highly unusual case of persons in a small ifc who have access to a large and diverse economy in mainland china yet may refuse to seek new positions in the larger workplace for cultural or political reasons
2020-0131,8,"the hong kong government has blithely followed a market leads, government facilitates philosophy of laissez-faire for decades and thus also has failed to prepare for the social costs of fintech"
2020-0131,9,"while such preparation would indeed constitute social planning, an activity generally discouraged in hong kong, circumstances dictate that the hksar government begin to act socially, rather than merely facilitate the largest businesses"
2020-0087,0,payments and investments are part of consumers everyday life and vital to society and its economic and social systems
2020-0087,1,"as the evolution of fintech has laid the foundation for the next generation of technical innovation in the financial service sectors, this chapter discusses examples of fintech innovation and analyzes their opportunities as well as their ecological, societal, and technological risks from consumer and retail investor perspectives"
2020-0087,2,"while fintech innovation has the potential to make financial services easier, cheaper, and better available, all payment and investment services discussed in this chapter have in common the technological risks arising from the possibility to (mis)use consumers and retail investors data for price discrimination or identity theft"
2020-0087,3,"cryptocurrencies additionally pose ecological risks due to their enormous energy demand, while the new investment services may help retail investors to decrease the ecological risk of their portfolios"
2020-0087,4,"the societal risks of fintech overlap or coincide with the technological risks, for example, when consumer data is used to discriminate groups of consumers"
2020-0087,5,"in addition, the high degree of anonymity in cryptocurrency networks and the lack of centralized supervision can provide an ideal playing field for criminal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion that threaten consumer and retail investor welfare"
2020-0033,0,"in today's financial industry, fintech (financial technology) has showed its role of an innovation-driving area, which can bring outstanding changes to the traditional financial market"
2020-0033,1,this article will briefly introduce fintech as well as its development in vietnam
2020-0033,2,"besides, the research also provided a survey on experts' opinions on the challenges to the promotion of fintech application for the modernization of the banking-finance system in vietnam"
2020-0033,3,the survey results of 40 experts in banking with knowledge of fintech identify five challenges faced by fintech companies in vietnam: (1) legal corridor
2020-0033,4,(2) infrastructure
2020-0033,5,(3) fintech companies
2020-0033,6,(4) customers
2020-0033,7,and (5) human resources
2020-0033,8,"from these five challenges/barriers, there are 14 detailed aspects"
2020-0033,9,the results of the expert survey using descriptive statistics show that all five factors are assessed to be low and need to be better addressed in the future
2020-0033,10,the authors suggest several solutions for further development of fintech to support the modernization of the banking-finance system in vietnam: (1) quickly complete the regulatory framework
2020-0033,11,(2) introduce policies on tax exemption
2020-0033,12,(3) promote research and application of the benefits of block-chain technology
2020-0033,13,(4) utilize the abilities of the human resources
2020-0033,14,and (5) actively promote and popularize knowledge about fintech
2020-0132,0,"most financial literacy (fl) measurements focus on savings and investments decisions, as it is geared towards retirement planning"
2020-0132,1,"consequently, most adults around the world are classified as financial illiterate (fi)"
2020-0132,2,billions of individuals belonging to low-income populations (lips) do not have the means to plan for retirement
2020-0132,3,"regardless, they are often measured through the same fl measurements (flms) and classified as fis"
2020-0132,4,"lips are not necessarily incapable of making financial decisions, but flms do not necessarily fit their context, making it an inappropriate measurement"
2020-0132,5,"moreover, fintech is increasing the financial options that lips have"
2020-0132,6,it is thus relevant to create an appropriate measurement that addresses this inadequacy
2020-0132,7,this paper is a first step towards the creation of a measurement called financial awareness that is geared towards lips who access financial services (fs) through information communication technologies (icts)
2020-0065,0,"in this article, we propose a visualization approach that presents the users cognitive and emotional states in conjunction with the actual journey of the user on a web interface"
2020-0065,1,"specifically, we have designed a new visualization method which contextualizes the users physiological and behavioral data while interacting with a web-based information system in the financial services industry"
2020-0065,2,the proposed approach brings together the users behavior with his/her cognitive and emotional states to produce a rich overview of his/her experience
2020-0065,3,combining these methods produces key insights into the user experience and facilitates an understanding of the evolution of the experience since it highlights where the user was on the interface when s/he experienced a given cognitive and emotional state
2020-0065,4,results from an illustrative case suggest that the proposed visualization method is useful in conveying where participants deviate from the optimal path and facilitates the identification of usability issues on web interfaces
2020-0133,0,this article examines potential consumer harm that may arise due to regulating modern financial services communication technology with rules written in the early 20th century
2020-0133,1,"it is argued that disparities in record keeping regulation across communication mediums disincentivizes the use of technology capable of generating records for consumer retention, while incentivizing the use of technology which shields financial advisors from accountability"
2020-0133,2,experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument
2020-0133,3,"further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm"
2020-0133,4,"objections to these arguments are considered, along with practical guidance for consumers, regulators, and policy makers"
2020-0053,0,this study used data from the 2015 national financial capability study to analyze the adoption of mobile payments by u.s
2020-0053,1,households
2020-0053,2,"while 24% of respondents used mobile payments, the mean rate for those under age 25 was 11 times the rate for those 65 and older"
2020-0053,3,"state rates ranged from about 9% in montana to 34% in washington, dc"
2020-0053,4,"based on a logistic regression, age and an objective financial knowledge score were negatively while risk tolerance and a subjective financial knowledge score were positively related to mobile payment use"
2020-0053,5,"the results have implications for marketing of fintech applications for personal finance, especially in terms of the extremely low mobile payment use by older consumers"
2020-0012,0,purpose: the crowdfunding market has experienced rapid growth in recent years
2020-0012,1,"however, not all projects are successfully financed because of information asymmetries between the founder and the providers of external finance"
2020-0012,2,"this shortfall in funding has made factors that lead to successful fundraising, a great interest to researchers"
2020-0012,3,"this study draws on the social capital theory, human capital theory and level of processing (lop) theory to predict the success of crowdfunding projects"
2020-0012,4,design/methodology/approach: a feature set is extracted and correlations between project success and features are utilized to order the features
2020-0012,5,the artificial neural network (ann) is popularly applied to analyze the dependencies of the input variables to improve the accuracy of prediction
2020-0012,6,"however, the problem of overfitting may exist in such neural networks"
2020-0012,7,this study proposes a neural network method based on ensemble machine learning and dropout methods to generate several neural networks for preventing the problem of overfitting
2020-0012,8,four machine learning techniques are applied and compared for prediction performance
2020-0012,9,"findings: this study shows that the success of crowdfunding projects can be predicted by measuring and analyzing big data of social media activity, human capital of funders and online project presentation"
2020-0012,10,the ensemble neural network method achieves highest accuracy
2020-0012,11,the investments rose from early projects and another platform by the funder serve as credible indicators for later investors
2020-0012,12,practical implications: the managerial implication of this study is that the project founders and investors can apply the proposed model to predict the success of crowdfunding projects
2020-0012,13,this study also identifies the most influential features that affect fundraising outcomes
2020-0012,14,the project funders can use these features to increase the successful opportunities of crowdfunding project
2020-0012,15,originality/value: this study contributes to apply a new machine learning modeling method to extract features from activity data of crowdfunding platforms and predict crowdfunding project success
2020-0012,16,"in addition, it contributes to the research on the deployment of social capital, human capital and online presentation strategies in a crowdfunding context as well as offers practical implications for project funders and investors"
2020-0134,0,"over the last decade, fintechbroadly defined as the use of new technologies to compete in the marketplace of financial institutions and intermediarieshas disrupted the financial services sector"
2020-0134,1,"here, we revisit the question of how banks and regulators can best respond to this disruption"
2020-0134,2,we argue that incumbent financial service providers can learn useful lessons from the experience of the most innovative companies in the world and their efforts to navigate the new realities of doing business in a networked age
2020-0134,3,one of the striking features of successful large businesses with an established track record for sustained high performance has been their capacity to reinvent themselves as what we characterise as innovation ecosystems
2020-0134,4,"a key element of an ecosystemstyle organisation has been the implementation of effective corporate venturing strategies that feed dynamic, technology-driven innovation (what has been termed borrowing the start-up genies magic)"
2020-0134,5,"here, we identify seven corporate venturing strategies adopted by the most innovative companies in the world and argue that incumbent banks and other financial service providers could utilise similar strategies in responding to fintech"
2020-0134,6,"a crucial element of these strategies is a recognition of the value of co-creation, namely an inclusive, collaborative partnering between incumbents and non-traditional market players"
2020-0134,7,"to implement this objective effectively, incumbents need to absorb the energy, skills, and resources of the most dynamic start-ups"
2020-0134,8,we argue that some banks are already moving in this direction and that this trend towards the unbundling of incumbents is likely to continue
2020-0134,9,"we conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of such an account for regulators and regulatory design, more generally"
2020-0134,10,"in order to establish an environment for successful and sustainable ecosystems, regulators need to become active participants in these more open forms of business organisation"
2020-0134,11,we characterise this regulatory approach as community-driven regulatory design and identify some key issues with such a regulatory strategy
2020-0013,0,"although theory suggests that financial market imperfectionsmainly information asymmetries, market segmentation and transaction costsprevent poor people from escaping poverty by limiting their access to formal financial services, new financial technologies (fintech) are seen as key enablers of financial inclusion"
2020-0013,1,"indeed, the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development (un-2030-asd) and the g20 high-level principles for digital financial inclusion (g20-hlp-dfi) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of fintech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality"
2020-0013,2,"this paper investigates the interrelationship between fintech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the global findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017"
2020-0013,3,we posit that fintech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion
2020-0013,4,we invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality
2020-0013,5,we uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which fintech reduces income inequality
2020-0013,6,"we also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries"
2020-0013,7,"overall, our results support the aspirations of the un-2030-asd and g20-hlp-dfi"
2020-0013,8,highlights harnessing the potential of fintech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality has been proposed by the un and g20
2020-0013,9,we posit that fintech affects income inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion
2020-0013,10,we invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether the effects of fintech differ across countries with different levels of income inequality
2020-0013,11,"we find that financial inclusion is a key channel through which fintech reduces income inequality, at all quantile levels, primarily among higher-income countries"
2020-0064,0,"we investigate how the emergence of fintech start-ups and their financing is shaped by regional knowledge creation and lack of trust in financial services incumbents across 21 oecd countries, 226 regions and over the 20072014 period"
2020-0064,1,we find that knowledge generated in the it sector is much more salient for fostering new fintech start-ups than knowledge generated in the financial services sector
2020-0064,2,"additionally, the importance of new knowledge created in the financial services sector (it sector) increases (decreases) as fintech start-ups grow and seek financing"
2020-0064,3,"when the level of trust in financial services incumbents falls within a region, this is followed by an increase in the financing provided to fintech start-ups"
2020-0064,4,"nevertheless, regions with historically low average levels of trust in financial services incumbents attract less fintech investment overall"
2020-0214,0,the aim of the work was to identify the impact of modern financial technologies (fintech) on the institutional structure of the russian banking system
2020-0214,1,the paper used a qualitative analysis of the development of fintech in the banking system of russia
2020-0214,2,"the active participation of the state was revealed (including the bank of russia), the creation of associations and joint business projects, the growth in fintech financing, primarily by large russian banks, the transition of large russian banks to the use of new business models and the production of new banking services, increased sales personalization banking services, reducing risks in banking and increasing its productivity, reducing both banks and their branches"
2020-0214,3,the use of the multiple regression apparatus made it possible to identify an inversely proportional dependence of the number of internal structural units of russian credit organizations on the volume of payment orders received via the internet and using subscriber mobile communication devices
2020-0214,4,the multiple regression equation allows us to predict the dynamics of structural units of russian credit organizations
2020-0214,5,"it is concluded that with the development of fintech, the number of structural divisions and the number of traditional jobs of bank employees are sharply reduced"
2020-0214,6,"at the same time, the demand for fintech specialists is increasing"
2020-0088,0,"inexperienced individual investors are the main players in the emerging fintech industry, and also suffer from frequent negative events in the markets"
2020-0088,1,"with 3,110 negative events and 467,594 transaction data of chinas peer-to-peer lending market from 2015 to 2018, this paper analyzes how different types of platform negative events affect the decision-making of individual investors"
2020-0088,2,"we find that individual investors only have a significant negative reaction to moral hazard exposure events such as platforms absconding, with relatively ignorance of other types of negative events"
2020-0088,3,"the negative effect is rapid but short-lived, and shows differences among platforms of different background and attributes"
2020-0088,4,"by the mediation analysis, we find that public attention can be a mediator and explain the pattern of the impact that absconding events have on individual investors"
2020-0088,5,"related risk prevention, regulation, investor education issues are discussed and further suggestions are also put forward for both individual investors and regulators"
2020-0061,0,"as the world's ict technology develops, the application of new technology will facilitate the change and development of the financial industry as it moves into universal, microfinance and wisdom financing by providing services to niche markets"
2020-0061,1,"after reviewing previous studies on financial service characteristics, customer satisfaction and use intentions, an empirical study was conducted"
2020-0061,2,"financial services are characterized by convenience, profitability, security and flexibility"
2020-0061,3,the study aims to analyze what factors influence the intent of users to manage personal assets based on fintech-based alipay
2020-0061,4,this study used spss 22.0 for basic statistics and structural equations analyzed with smart pls 2.0 (partial least squares)
2020-0061,5,the findings are as follows
2020-0061,6,"first, the characteristics of financial services (convenience, benefits, security, and flexibility) give major influence on the increasing of customer satisfaction"
2020-0061,7,"second, the increasing of customer satisfaction gives significant influence on use intentions"
2020-0061,8,"this means that in order to settle in the market, it is essential to establish differentiated financial services in a rapidly changing business market"
2020-0061,9,"in order to draw clients in the mobile market, it is necessary to actively use the characteristics of financial services"
2020-0009,0,pursose: the ongoing corona virus (covid 19) pandemic has already impacted almost everyone across the globe
2020-0009,1,the focus has now shifted from spread of the disease to the economic consequences it will bring to the society
2020-0009,2,the shortage of production will result into the shortage of supply and consequently will end as loss of jobs and employment for millions of people around the world
2020-0009,3,"two of the most important section of our society i.e., daily wage laborers and small and medium enterprises (smes) will have to bear the major burnt of this crisis"
2020-0009,4,the proposed integrated artificial intelligence and nlp based islamic fintech model combining zakat (islamic tax) and qardh-al-hasan (benevolent loan) can help the economy to minimize the adverse impact of covid 19 on individuals and smes
2020-0009,5,design/methodology/approach: the present study explores the possibility of zakat and qardh-al-hasan as a financing method to fight the adverse impact of corona virus on poor individuls and smes
2020-0009,6,it provides the solution by proposing an artificial intelligence and nlp based islamic fintech model combining zakat and qardh-al-hasan
2020-0009,7,findings: the findings of the study reveals that islamic finance has immense potential to fight any kind of situation/pandemic
2020-0009,8,"zakat and qardh-al-hasan, if combined together can prove to be a deadly combination to fight the adverse effect of covid 19"
2020-0009,9,practical implications: to be used as an effective way to support individuals and smes in the period during and after the pandemic of covid 19
2020-0009,10,originality/value: there is no study combining zakat and qardh al-hasan to fight the adverse effect of poor individuals and smes
2020-0009,11,the study will contribute massively to the existing literature and will help the government and civil societies in fighting the economic impact of covid 19 on individuals and smes
2020-0215,0,this study investigates the extent to which nigerian banks manage fintech's destruction through innovative banking
2020-0215,1,"guided by the sensing and responding theory, data was collected via a questionnaire and analysed using kruskal-wallis and post-hoc pairwise comparisons tests"
2020-0215,2,"the study found, among other things, that nigerian banks are well aware of threats pose by fintech companies and are effectively managing the threats through competitive innovative banking products and services"
2020-0215,3,"equally, the study found that nigerian banks are not lagging in the provision of innovative banking services"
2020-0215,4,the study concludes that fintech is destructive and nigerian banks are proactive in managing it
2020-0215,5,further studies are recommended to examine the effect of each of the banking products and services in managing the destruction from fintech
2020-0135,0,"fintech is an active area of innovation and a rapidly growing sector of the economy, yet relatively little is known about how information technology contributes to innovation in fintech"
2020-0135,1,we draw on the business model canvas framework and we examine the role of information technology in the business models of leading fintech startups in the new york city fintech ecosystem
2020-0135,2,"we find that information technology plays a key role across nearly all components of the business models, orchestrating resources and processes to efficiently deliver personalized financial services to customers"
2020-0135,3,"focusing on the it-enabled value propositions across the fintech startups in our sample, we find that the startups tend to emphasize low-cost offerings that may pose a threat to incumbent business models in financial services"
2020-0089,0,"financial technology, or fintech, has recently attracted considerable attention both in the financial industry and academia"
2020-0089,1,"it covers a large range of technologies, including big data, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency, and is widely used in the finance industry"
2020-0089,2,"despite the broad application of fintech, little academic research has explored the development of this new wave of technological innovations"
2020-0089,3,"our study aims to identify, classify, and track the development of fintech innovations using patent data"
2020-0089,4,a difficulty is that there are no accurate international patent classification (ipc) codes that we can refer to as fintech innovations
2020-0089,5,"hence, in this paper we provide a comprehensive method for identifying fintech patents"
2020-0089,6,"we first use a text-based filtering technique to locate potential fintech patents and get a data set comprising 37,156 records"
2020-0089,7,we then construct a training sample of fintech patents by reading those patent files manually
2020-0089,8,"next, textual analysis and machine-learning techniques are applied to identify all fintech patents in the whole data set, based on the initial sample"
2020-0089,9,we classify fintech patents into seven categories according to the key underlying technologies and track the development of each category
2020-0089,10,thus a whole picture of fintech innovations is formed
2020-0216,0,"the banking industry, a traditional financial industry, has entered the digital age and positioned fintech as an important role in business model transformation and service upgrading"
2020-0216,1,"fintech events of chinese large commercial banks between 2016 and 2019 are taken as research samples, and the research shows that the release of the fintech has a positive effect on commercial bank's stock price but has a time lag"
2020-0216,2,"from the short-term perspective, after the fourth day, the event began to bring statistically significant and positive effect to the commercial stock price, and until the eighth day, the positive impact of the event was biggest"
2020-0216,3,"also, the abnormal return rate car (cumulative average abnormal return) brought by fintech events is negatively correlated with the banks' market prices and roe (return on equity), and is positively correlated with the length of listing, and has no statistically significant correlation with soe (state-owned sized enterprise)"
2020-0008,0,purpose: the paper aims to review the academic research work done in the area of islamic financial technology
2020-0008,1,"the islamic fintech area has been classified into three broad categories of the islamic fintech, islamic financial technology opportunities and challenges, cryptocurrency/blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation"
2020-0008,2,"finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that islamic financial institutions can learn from the conventional fintech organization across the world"
2020-0008,3,"approach/methodology/design: the study collected 133 research studies (50 from social science research network (ssrn), 30 from research gate, 33 from google scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of islamic financial technology"
2020-0008,4,the study presents the systematic review of the above studies
2020-0008,5,"findings: the study classifies the islamic fintech into three broad categories namely, islamic fintech opportunities and challenges, cryptocurrency/blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation"
2020-0008,6,the study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/blockchain is the biggest challenge which islamic fintech organizations are facing
2020-0008,7,during our review we also find that islamic fintech organizations are to be considered as partners by the islamic financial institutions (ifi's) than the competitors
2020-0008,8,"if islamic financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt fintech and become partners with the fintech companies"
2020-0008,9,"practical implications: the study will contribute positively to the understanding of islamic fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other fintech users"
2020-0008,10,originality/value: the study believes to contribute positively to understanding of fintech based technology like cryptocurrency/blockchain from sharia perspective
2020-0090,0,purpose: the aim of the paper is to develop the approach to a legal definition of fintech
2020-0090,1,"design/methodology/approach: in this paper we evolve possible approaches of fintech legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels"
2020-0090,2,"document analysis, as a form of qualitative research, was used in this study"
2020-0090,3,"findings: we found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address fintech companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and fintech operators"
2020-0090,4,"in our opinion, no specific legislation for fintech companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc"
2020-0090,5,"practical implications: the term fintech is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally"
2020-0090,6,"according to international organizations such as the imf, the world bank and the oecd, fintech offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries"
2020-0090,7,some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for fintech and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment
2020-0090,8,"originality/value: there is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of fintech among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area"
2020-0090,9,the value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of fintech by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way
2020-0136,0,"currently, lending fintech is proliferating"
2020-0136,1,it is because of the high financing needs of the people who have not been reached by the banks
2020-0136,2,the existence of lending fintech is getting stronger with the issuance of the financial service authority regulation number 77 of 2018 concerning information technology-based money lending and borrowing services
2020-0136,3,"until august 2019, there were 127 lending fintech registered in the financial service authority"
2020-0136,4,"unfortunately, there is still a problem concerning protecting consumers who make loan transactions with fintech companies, along with the rise of illegal fintech companies"
2020-0136,5,"therefore, this paper tries to analyze the potential development of lending fintech in indonesia, along with its opportunities and challenges"
2020-0136,6,the study of this research uses normative juridical
2020-0136,7,this paper concludes that the current regulation is still not enough in providing legal protection to consumers in conducting the transaction in lending fintech
2020-0136,8,"therefore, it is necessary to make a comprehensive regulation that regulates this so that public trust in the lending fintech company is higher"
2020-0217,0,"the paper deals with the issues of main directions, challenges and threats of development of the newest financial technologiesfintech, regtech and traditional financial intermediation"
2020-0217,1,"the authors analyze modern ecosystem and fintechs global trends, their influence on the transformation of principles, models and emergence of new threats of traditional financial intermediation"
2020-0217,2,the trends of fintech distribution in ukraine are considered
2020-0217,3,"the areas of activity of traditional financial intermediaries, which require the use of the latest technological tools, the possible effects of the influence of modern regulatory standards on the banking sphere are studied"
2020-0217,4,"the authors describe features of regtech application for improvement financial intermediaries risk management systems, usage of innovative regulatory technology tools that can enhance the quality and efficiency of financial institutions compliance systems as a prerequisite for increasing the protection of depositors, creditors and investors interests"
2020-0217,5,new opportunities for cooperation between traditional financial intermediaries and regtech companies are examined
2020-0217,6,post-crisis world-view changes in the formulation of targets for the use of financial innovations and fintech are substantiated
2020-0217,7,"the spectrum of potential financial stability risks posed by fintech, which requires systematic monitoring by entities providing financial stability, is determined"
2020-0027,0,the purpose of this study is to investigate the world-widesfinancial technology (fintech) educationand particularly the gulf cooperation council (gcc) practices toprovide a roadmap and suggestions towards the proper fintech education in the gcc
2020-0027,1,"therefore, we conducted an in-depth interview with 15scholars and fintech specialists from different gulf universities (i.e"
2020-0027,2,"from bahrain, saudi arabia, uae, kuwait, and oman)"
2020-0027,3,"in addition, the study used secondary data to explore the current opportunities and education of universities in the field of fintech"
2020-0027,4,"and the projects and researches in this field, which emerged with new technological developments in universities"
2020-0027,5,"websites on the financial departments of universities in the gcc, data from the national education ministry of the concerned countries were also examined.the findings reveal thatnone of the universities in the gcc is included in the top 10 leaders in fintech/crypto education"
2020-0027,6,"despite there are a sufficientnumber of finance departments and centers of research, most universities in the gcc have inappropriate education systems for preparing professional staff working in the fintech sector"
2020-0027,7,"furthermore, the training process is also not making the necessary progress for this industry to join the international race in this field"
2020-0027,8,"approaches of education are still traditional and behind the advancement of others, there is classic methods of learning and education techniques with no real connection with technology"
2020-0027,9,we conclude that each educated individual in the gcc has to think about fintech in light of the fact that it may be one of the world's most significant advancements in the near future
2020-0027,10,"further, the blockchain technology may assist us with changing the connections among schools, colleges, universities and, thusly, their relationship to society"

2020-0046,0,fintech is not any new theory or a concept
2020-0046,1,but rather it is a phase which tends to bubble up every now and then as new forms of technologies revolutionize the world
2020-0046,2,fintech has been applied in various sectors
2020-0046,3,multiple scholars have investigated this phenomenon from the prism of the users in order to comprehend their perceptions of benefits and risks for using fintech: predominantly revealing that perceived benefit and perceived risks affect intention to use of fintech
2020-0046,4,and for raising awareness for fintech users
2020-0046,5,this is a review of current literature and it proposes a conceptual model viable for future empirical assessment
2020-0046,6,"also, recommendations are made in this article for future research in relation to the model and the nine propositions of this study"
2020-0218,0,"the purpose of this research is to find out and analyze more deeply about how the development of financial technology (fintech) today, how opportunities and threats of fintech to conventional commercial banks, how competitiveness of conventional commercial banks, how big is the influence of fintech opportunities on the competitiveness of conventional commercial banks, how big the influence of fintech's threat to the competitiveness of conventional commercial banks, and how much influence simultaneously the opportunities and threats of fintech to the competitiveness of conventional commercial banks"
2020-0218,1,this research uses a quantitative approach with descriptive and verification analysis
2020-0218,2,the number of research samples was 171 people with fintech service user criteria
2020-0218,3,"this study uses spss, developing, and testing hypotheses using amos statistics"
2020-0218,4,"the research data analysis technique used descriptive analysis using multiple linear regression, and the method of successive interval (msi)"
2020-0218,5,"the results of this study are listed in the t-test value column, using the  = 5% level, the results for the fintech opportunity variable can thus be stated that the fintech opportunity does not significantly affect the competitiveness of conventional banks"
2020-0218,6,"as for the threat of fintech, it can be explained that the threat of fintech has a significant effect on the competitiveness of conventional banks"
2020-0218,7,the results of the hypothesis are rejected that the threat of fintech does not significantly influence the competitiveness of conventional banks
2020-0219,0,"agriculture is the primary occupation and the backbone of the indian economy as per the report of ficci, over 70 percent of the population in india depends on agriculture"
2020-0219,1,"indian government has been trying hard to provide financial services to the people who don't have access to these services through 'digital drive-, which was partially successful"
2020-0219,2,but still large number of rural people especially farmers depends on traditional credit system
2020-0219,3,presently to support farmer technologically agri- tech is providing services
2020-0219,4,"fin-tech provides financial service to all the sectors, but there is no impact on farming sector for providing credit facilities"
2020-0219,5,so the farmers are more dependent on the private lenders for loans with high interest rates for their farming needs
2020-0219,6,but due to this repayment of loan with high interest has become huge burden and is leading to suicides and deaths
2020-0219,7,the aim of the paper is to analyze the fin- tech in agri sector and its impact in helping the farmers to fulfill their needs to lesser their burdens
2020-0219,8,this helps farmers to overcome the situations and sustain to the changes in the market
2020-0044,0,financial technology (fintech) has attracted a wide range of attention and is rapidly proliferating
2020-0044,1,as a result of its consistent growth new terms have been introduced in this domain
2020-0044,2,the term 'fintech' is one such terminology
2020-0044,3,this term is used for describing various operations that are being frequently employed in the financial technology sector
2020-0044,4,these operations are usually practiced in enterprises or organizations and provide requested services by using information technology based applications
2020-0044,5,"the term does take into account various other sensitive issues, like, security, privacy, threats, cyber-attacks, etc"
2020-0044,6,"this is important to note that the development of fintech is indebted to the mutual integration of different state of the art technologies, for example, technologies related to a mobile embedded system, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing, big data, data analytics techniques, and cloud computing etc"
2020-0044,7,"however, this technology is facing several security and privacy issues that are much needed to be addressed in order to improve the acceptability of this new technology among its users"
2020-0044,8,"in an effort to secure fintech, this article provides a comprehensive survey of fintech by reviewing the most recent as well as anticipated financial industry privacy and security issues"
2020-0044,9,"it provides a comprehensive analysis of current security issues, detection mechanisms and security solutions proposed for fintech"
2020-0044,10,"finally, it discusses future challenges to ensure the security and privacy of financial technology applications"
2020-0063,0,"the revolutionary disruptive digital transformation in financial markets-a scenario more challenging than the 2007/2008 financial crisis-requires swift, agile but sustainable responses by the law"
2020-0063,1,mapping and analysing the plethora of legal implications of rapidly further evolving financial technology have gained momentum
2020-0063,2,the paper aims to contribute to it
2020-0063,3,focus is on the german view
2020-0063,4,"the following questions have inspired the analysis: how might fintech best be defined and its most important manifestations best be systematized for legal purposes? have the most pressing legal issues been addressed, so far? the paper considers the legal challenges of fintech as huge, reaching far beyond financial markets"
2020-0063,5,it argues that artificial intelligence and machine learning deserve utmost attention particularly in this context
2020-0063,6,"the paper postulates that the law-being well-equipped to control the complex, constantly morphing risks of financial innovation while allowing exploiting its benefits-shall not just react to but lead the transformation"
2020-0063,7,the present author considers particularly legal academia responsible for continuously steering and shaping a balanced and objective discourse leading to adequate legal responses in the realm of fintech
2020-0063,8,it is time to reassert the crucial role of law in times of deep technological change not only in financial markets
2020-0063,9,"'it is a world of change-unparalleled, unsettling, dizzying change"
2020-0063,10,"the certainties of yesterday are the doubts of today, and the folly and mockery of tomorrow"
2020-0063,11,every problem we solve only reveals a dozen more of increasing complexity.'1
2020-0220,0,"although interest in fintech businesses has been growing, research about these companies is still scarce"
2020-0220,1,"to address this gap, this paper aims to understand the evolution of the fintechs ecosystem, through a socio-technical system theory and service innovation lense"
2020-0220,2,"a case study research methodology was used, in which 6 brazilian and 5 portuguese fintechs were analyzed"
2020-0220,3,"primary data was collected using semi-structured interviews with managers and employees of the startups, while secondary data was obtained through the analysis of reports from consulting firms and public relations materials of the startups"
2020-0220,4,results show the evolution of fintech ecosystems from the perspective of socio-technical system theory and service innovation
2020-0220,5,"from the socio-technical system perspective it was possible to understand the roles of social, technological and organizational actors in the evolution of these ecosystems"
2020-0220,6,"from the service innovation perspective, it was possible to understand the dynamics of the evolution of the fintech ecosystems and its results"
2020-0221,0,the fintech(s) is an economic sector involving a number of enterprises that use technology to offer more efficient financial services
2020-0221,1,these startups disrupt the classical financial system namely commercial banks by modifying the payments and debts mechanism
2020-0221,2,their technology offers opportunities in terms of enhancing the current financial services and widening the consumers choices
2020-0221,3,"in this paper, the author assesses the different conditions and requirements for the survival of the banking sector amidst the emergence of the fintech startups worldwide and specifically in lebanon"
2020-0221,4,"in this paper, the author explains the emergence and positioning of fintech firms before developing a research model for this end"
2020-0221,5,"the model shall be based on the behavioral and innovation theories in finance, will be tested on site using structured interviews with banking specialists and officials, and will finally quantitatively be analyzed for research purposes"
2020-0137,0,in this paper we attempt to characterize the stability of shadow deposits in china with interest rate liberalization and fintech developments
2020-0137,1,we emphasize that shadow banks provide higher but riskier returns and such characteristics affect the stability of shadow deposits
2020-0137,2,"in our setting, the stability of shadow deposits is influenced by two offsetting effects, namely: the patience effect, which makes investors more willing to wait because of the potentially higher returns"
2020-0137,3,"and the uncertainty effect, which makes investors more likely to withdraw as a result of higher risk"
2020-0137,4,"under liberalized interest rates, the patience effect will erode and the uncertainty effect will be heightened because the post-liberalization higher return of traditional banks undermines the importance of the extra return of shadow deposits to depositors, while preserving the importance of the risk aspect"
2020-0137,5,fintech development is modeled as a reduction in the withdrawal cost that facilitates runs
2020-0137,6,this affects the stability of shadow deposits because of their wider fintech reliance
2020-0137,7,regulators should be cautious in pushing interest rate liberalization and fintech application alongside building a safety net for shadow banking
2020-0026,0,the emergence of a digital divide or a lack of internet access may hinder urbanization and adversely affect growth
2020-0026,1,"however, fintech development can help to improve the accessibility and affordability of financial services, particularly for sections of the population formerly excluded from such services"
2020-0026,2,"improved access is expected to stimulate the growth essential for promoting urbanization, possibly alleviating the negative impacts of a digital divide and creating a trickle-down effect"
2020-0026,3,"this paper is among the first to investigate the effect of fintech development on urbanization, as indicated by labor transfer from agricultural to non-agricultural sectors in china"
2020-0026,4,"it is found that: (i) the digital divide hindered, while fintech development contributed to urbanization"
2020-0026,5,"(ii) the positive effect of fintech development on urbanization affects individuals both with and without access to the internet, yielding the so-called trickle-down effect and thus helping to alleviate the negative consequences of a digital divide"
2020-0026,6,"and (iii) regarding transmission mechanisms, fintech development helps to generate additional jobs and raise income in non-agricultural sectors, stimulating urbanization even for those without access to the internet"
2020-0047,0,in recent years the traditional financial industries have motivated for a new technology of financial technology (fintech) clinch embraced with internet of things (iot)
2020-0047,1,the requirements of fintech and iot need to be integrated into new business environment
2020-0047,2,several companies are affected because of the financial-level investments
2020-0047,3,"so, there is a need to improve the next level of the business"
2020-0047,4,fintech can introduce a new service of tools and products for the emergent businesses through the internet of services which provide ideas linked in internet
2020-0047,5,"nowadays, increasing number of companies uses the iot and creates new added values"
2020-0047,6,the administrators of existing money-related organization in the direct society are dreadful by means of budgetary innovation
2020-0047,7,the social innovation is accomplished by new innovation
2020-0047,8,"to make a powerful business plan and action, the fintech and iot are combined in order to create new innovative ideas based on the requirements"
2020-0222,0,if a web application is migrated or the version of the system is changed then the test scripts becomes incapable of being validated because of the differences in the platform being used in testing
2020-0222,1,regression tests need to be applied at that application after migration or version update are required to get written again in order to resolve compatibility issues with the new technologies
2020-0222,2,a problematic scenario occurs for the automation of script-level test when an application is updated or migrated just to include the technology which is not supported by the tool in use of testing
2020-0222,3,"in this case, the purpose of test automation is eradicated because the scripts for regression testing are rewritten with the scripting language of the new testing tool being utilized"
2020-0222,4,"in this paper, a model-driven approach is presented to develop the automated testing scripts for the validation of the fintech web applications"
2020-0222,5,a meta-model is proposed that depicts the scenario of regression testing of a fintech system
2020-0222,6,a case study of small e-commerce platform known as liberty books is used for validation
2020-0000,0,this paper is a review of the literature on fintech and its interaction with banking
2020-0000,1,"included in fintech are innovations in payment systems (including cryptocurrencies), credit markets (including p2p lending), and insurance, with blockchain-assisted smart contracts playing a role"
2020-0000,2,"the paper provides a definition of fintech, examines some statistics and stylized facts, and then reviews the theoretical and empirical literature"
2020-0000,3,the review is organized around four main research questions
2020-0000,4,the paper summarizes our knowledge on these questions and concludes with questions for future research
2019-0052,0,"this paper explores the possibility of using big data and fintech tools to comply with the duties of advice and adequacy, typical of the model of the ""responsible loans"", as mechanisms to avoid excessive debt or alleviate it once evidenced"
2019-0052,1,"with these alternatives of information processing, certain problems in the dynamics of the protective regulation for the financial consumer can be solved, such as the deficiencies in the configuration of models of information recipients (the ""average consumer""), the overcoming of the duties of information and its necessary reformulation as duties of advice or warning and the promotion of the renegotiation of the debt for its adjustment to the real possibilities of payment of the debtor"
2019-0082,0,[no abstract available
2019-0083,0,"in society 5.0, financial capital is no longer the key, but data that are interconnected with each other"
2019-0083,1,"the internet of things will be a new normal, dedicated to unlocking human potentials"
2019-0083,2,the purpose of this study is to analyze the feasibilities and challenges of the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries
2019-0083,3,"to this end, a survey was conducted on a sample of 60 small and medium industries"
2019-0083,4,"it was revealed that the implementation of fintech in small and medium industries did not seem ready to be achieved due to the limitations in technology infrastructure, data and information, human resources and policy"
2019-0083,5,"therefore, improvement to these factors should be made to realize the human-centered and technology-based society"
2019-0033,0,contemporary innovation destroys more value than it creates by three effects
2019-0033,1,"first it mimics already existing basic technologies (phone, camera, directory, games) adding little value but displacing while disrupting existing services"
2019-0033,2,"second, it exploits human rights to security, privacy and truthful reportage without seriously regulated or legislated accountability"
2019-0033,3,"third, social mediathe main offendertakes prodigious profits at huge social cost, by facilitating the grooming of terrorists, vulnerable persons and enabling varieties of criminality"
2019-0033,4,"it feloniously steals private property, notably human identities for advertising revenue"
2019-0033,5,"and it facilitates dissemination of fake news, research and propaganda"
2019-0033,6,"to parody mark zuckerbergs injunction to his companys corporate mission and its achievement of monopoly advantage the company was, until recently, officially driven to move fast and break things (i.e"

2019-0018,0,this article describes the growing field of financial technology (fintech) and the different financial paradigms and technologies that support it
2019-0018,1,fintech is primarily a disintermediation force where disruptive technologies are the drivers
2019-0018,2,"this framework discusses 10 primary areas in fintech comprising a taxonomy, which categorizes research in the field and also proposes a pedagogical structure"
2019-0018,3,pitfalls of fintech are also analyzed
2019-0018,4,"overall, the great strides made in computing technology, mathematics, statistics, psychology, econometrics, linguistics, cryptography, big data, and computer interfaces have combined to create an explosion of fintechs"
2019-0017,0,there have been concerns about the use of alternative data sources by fintech lenders
2019-0017,1,we compare loans made by lendingclub and similar loans that were originated by banks
2019-0017,2,"the correlations between the rating grades (assigned by lendingclub) and the borrowers fico scores declined from about 80% (for loans originated in 2007) to about 35% for recent vintages (originated in 20142015), indicating that nontraditional data (not already accounted for in the fico scores) have been increasingly used by fintech lenders"
2019-0017,3,the rating grades perform well in predicting loan default
2019-0017,4,"the use of alternative data has allowed some borrowers who would have been classified as subprime by traditional criteria to be slotted into better loan grades, allowing them to obtain lower priced credit"
2019-0014,0,transformation of agribusiness is critical in light of the agenda for sustainable development
2019-0014,1,"fintech and the integration of fintech with other (green) technologies as well as with digitized agriculture plays an important role when it comes to, for example, sdg 12, specifically, responsible production, as it can mitigate trade-offs and enhance synergies between environmental and social sdgs, for example, 1 and 15, increasing profitability without additional use of natural resources"
2019-0014,2,"important limitations and risks need to be addressed, however, for developing countries to fully benefit from the potential that fintech holds in this context"
2019-0014,3,mitigating factors include massive infrastructure investments and large-scale capacity building
2019-0014,4,rigorous research on economic sustainability and cost-effectiveness of newer fintech models is needed to make sound policy recommendations
2019-0027,0,"with the rapid development of information technology (it) in financial industry, financial technology (fintech) has become an emerging area for enterprises and organizations"
2019-0027,1,"due to the wide adoption of it, various fintech applications are used by financial industry to help process information and offer financial services"
2019-0027,2,"traditionally, textual passwords are the most widely deployed authentication mechanism, while having many known limitations"
2019-0027,3,"as a result, there is a need to enhance the security of fintech authentication against cyber-criminals"
2019-0027,4,"as an alternative, graphical passwords (gps) are considered as one promising solution to complement traditional password-based systems"
2019-0027,5,"in the literature, various gp schemes were proposed such as passpoints, das, cued click points, geopass, etc"
2019-0027,6,"in this work, we identify that multiple password inference has become a challenge for most gp schemes, and thus design routemap, a map-and route-based gp to further improve the security of fintech applications"
2019-0027,7,this scheme requires users to create a route on a world map as their credentials
2019-0027,8,"in the evaluation, we involved a total of 120 participants, among which 60 of them have financial (fintech) background, and investigated the performance of routemap by comparing it with two similar schemes"
2019-0027,9,our results demonstrate that participants can achieve better performance using routemap in the aspects of both authentication accuracy and multiple password memory
2019-0027,10,our effort attempts to complement existing studies and stimulate more research on the combination of gp and fintech
2019-0079,0,the financial industry has been a competitive industry as financial institutions are providing almost similar products and services
2019-0079,1,this results them in competing based on service quality
2019-0079,2,"in addition to that, the fast evolution in technology has cause fintech application mobile to be introduced in malaysia"
2019-0079,3,"thus, this research will look into the several factors affecting customer satisfaction in malaysia where ease of use, security & privacy, information presentation, convenience and lastly service quality will be taken into account by applying variable associated to the integration theory of dissonance, assimilation and contrast"
2019-0079,4,this paper is a quantitative study where data are collected through online questionnaires
2019-0079,5,"the results of the pearson correlation analysis have shown that security and privacy (sp) is the strong influential factor of customer satisfaction towards fintech mobile payment services followed by service quality (sq), information presentation (ip) and ease of use (eou)"
2019-0079,6,"therefore, financial institutions in malaysia can enhance the security and privacy level or create awareness among their customers by giving and insight or explanation on the security level as well as privacy"
2019-0085,0,fintech is touted as a new paradigm in which information technology is driving thetransformation and innovation in the financial services industry
2019-0085,1,"fintech is evolving at a rapid speed, driven by favorable regulation, information technology and led by the consumers acceptance and adoption whose keen for cost reduction and improved quality of financial services"
2019-0085,2,this paper conducted a descriptive analysis on consumer acceptancetowardspayment-type fintech service by applying variables associated with technology acceptance model and diffusion of technology
2019-0085,3,"in addition, it analyzed the determinants of payment-type fintech service adoption among malaysians mobile user and the causal relationship between variables towards consumer decision in adopting payment-type fintech service"
2019-0085,4,quantitative research and descriptive research are utilized.the outcome indicates all variable are significant except perceived ease of use and social influence
2019-0047,0,the green development of fintech empowerment has become a compelling theme in economic development
2019-0047,1,"in this study, based on the weighted least squares (wls) and threshold regression methods of cross-sectional data, we empirically examine the impact of fintech development on agricultural nonpoint source (nps) pollution, a major cause of impaired surface water quality"
2019-0047,2,our results show that there is an inverted u shape relationship between the development of fintech and agricultural nps pollution
2019-0047,3,"that is, after crossing a threshold value, the level of fintech development can curb agricultural nps pollution"
2019-0047,4,"at the structural level, the availability of fintech services, the fintech infrastructure, and the agricultural nps pollution also have an inverted u shape relationship"
2019-0047,5,"at the threshold effect, in the developing stage of an agricultural economy, the overall level of fintech development, the use of fintech services, the availability of fintech services, and the fintech infrastructure have an inverted u shape relationship with agricultural nps pollution"
2019-0047,6,"on the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the impact of fintech development and its structure on agricultural nps pollution is insignificant"
2019-0047,7,"hence, we can conclude that fintech development can help reduce agricultural nps pollution in under-developed regions"
2019-0047,8,"however, due to the fact that a u shape relationship always exists between fintech service quality and agricultural nps pollution, the quality of fintech service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural nps pollution more effectively"

2019-0099,8,"this study contributes to the literature in terms of the analysis of the relationship between banking and fintech, which is based on turkish fintech ecosystem"
2019-0078,0,"to assure high quality of software systems, the comprehensiveness of the created test suite and efficiency of the adopted testing process are highly crucial, especially in the fintech industry, due to a fintech systems complicated system logic, mission-critical nature, and large test suite"
2019-0078,1,"however, the state of the testing practice in the fintech industry still heavily relies on manual efforts"
2019-0078,2,our recent research efforts contributed our previous approach as the first attempt to automate the testing process in china foreign exchange trade system (cfets) information technology co
2019-0078,3,"ltd., a subsidiary of chinas central bank that provides chinas foreign exchange transactions, and revealed that automating test generation for such complex trading platform could help alleviate some of these manual efforts"

2019-0034,0,disruptive innovation related modern information systems has recently altered the ways the companies do their businesses and it has positive impacts to those that are willing to adapt to it
2019-0034,1,the fast development of fintech startups on creating payment gateway and peer-to-peer (p2p) lending applications is one of examples for the modern disruptive innovations affecting to traditional financial business
2019-0034,2,the problem arises when the digital disruption affects the bank's business models due to change in customer trends with additional impacts to conventional companies
2019-0034,3,this paper presents the quantitative approaches like statistical hypothesis testing and analysis of regression using convenient random sampling for better analyzing the impacts of fintech on conventional banking industry in indonesia
2019-0034,4,"a number of important and realistic variables, such as customer satisfaction, net promotion score, promotion, ease of use, etc., were considered in this research in order to find a variety of the value propositions that dominantly influence to the adoption of fintech or banking products"
2019-0034,5,"the results show that the banks have been disrupted by the payment fintech since the emergence of fintech companies in around 2015, mainly due to superior value propositions, like promotion with standardized beta value of 0.349 and wide range of merchants with 0.153, respectively"
2019-0034,6,"in addition, the fintech startups have digital strategies on adopting a customer-centric mindset and developing a product that gives their customer a high customer satisfaction"
2019-0034,7,"however, in the current time, p2p fintechs do not have that significant disruption to the banks, mainly due to the fact that the customers consider more on safety reasons"
2019-0063,0,now in the era of artificial intelligence and digitalisation financial sector is adopting various digital tools in their products and services offerings
2019-0063,1,thats why user acceptance of technology in the financial sector has became the important field of the study
2019-0063,2,"internet banking, mobile banking, atm,cash deposit machines, instant payment services, online trading in stock markets, online funds transfers, e-wallets,wealth management, peer to peer lending, blockchain technology are various fintech products and services"

2019-0039,0,financial technology (fintech) based trading activities operate above and underground
2019-0039,1,"due to their nature, fintech products can be used within the dedicated regulatory framework or into the deep layers of the internet"
2019-0039,2,"this feature of fintech alone could potentially undermine the existing financial services regulation (fsr), the aim of which is to ensure financial stability through investor protection measures and measures protecting the integrity of the financial market"
2019-0039,3,"to this end, much of the illegal activities on the dark web have an interconnected and cross-sectorial impact on the fsrs aimsfor example, the on-going problem with stealing of personal data has implications on investor protection, often via market manipulation channels"
2019-0039,4,such considerations make it relevant to analyse the ways fintech used on the dark web could affect traditional and fintech activities in the financial sector
2019-0039,5,how strong this impact could be would probably depend on how ubiquitous fintech innovations are on the deep or dark web
2019-0039,6,"this article will argue that by definition their market presence is not only across the entire internet, but also very high in volume"
2019-0039,7,"this is all the more the case because fintechs brainchild, the cryptos, have become the go to currency for many activities outside the law"
2019-0012,0,"cyber threat attribution identifies the source of a malicious cyber activity, which in turn informs cyber security mitigation responses and strategies"
2019-0012,1,"such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical infrastructure sectors"
2019-0012,2,"however, existing approaches generally rely on manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments"
2019-0012,3,"these attack indicators, also known as low-level indicators of compromise (iocs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution"
2019-0012,4,"cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as compared to the low-level iocs"
2019-0012,5,"to attribute cyber threats effectively, it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary's attack patterns (e.g"
2019-0012,6,"tactics, techniques and procedures - ttps, software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber kill chain"
2019-0012,7,"identification of high-level attack patterns is time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim network(s) and other resources"
2019-0012,8,"in the rare case that attack patterns are reported in cyber threat intelligence (cti) reports, the format is textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident reports prepared for human consumption (e.g"
2019-0012,9,"prepared for c-level and senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by machines"
2019-0012,10,"thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber threat attribution"
2019-0012,11,"specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (ctas) based on their attack patterns extracted from cti reports, using the distributional semantics technique of natural language processing"
2019-0012,12,"using these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on 327 cti reports collected from publicly available incident reports that cover events from may 2012 to february 2018"
2019-0012,13,it is observed that the cta profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e
2019-0012,14,"83% as compared to other publicly available cta profiles, where the precision is 33%)"
2019-0012,15,the deep learning neural network (dlnn) based classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e
2019-0012,16,94% as compared to other classifiers)
2019-0036,0,"purpose: given the large global investments made in fintechs and the context of brazilian credit (which has been suffering from the effects of the crisis in the last decade), the purpose of this paper is to study the propensity of consumption of credit services offered by fintechs of loans"
2019-0036,1,"in order to discover the factors that influenced the propensity to apply for fintech loans, a theoretical model was designed, which was tested by means of a survey given to individuals who might contract loans"
2019-0036,2,"design/methodology/approach: the final sample consisted of 507 individuals whose data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (sem), with estimation of partial least squares"
2019-0036,3,"findings: from the results of the research, it was possible to draw a profile of the fintechs of brazilian loans and also to estimate the antecedents of the propensity to utilize this type of service"
2019-0036,4,research limitations/implications: the model proposed in this work was developed to measure the propensity to consume in relation to the credit services offered by lending fintechs
2019-0036,5,"practical implications: the consumer should intensify the use of these channels to shape financial products and services to their needs, thereby democratizing access to credit, which is often restricted in quantity and quality by policies of institutions that dominate the brazilian lending market"
2019-0036,6,"originality/value: aspects such as trust, personal innovation, perceived utility, ease of use and social influence, as well as the constructs that precede them like privacy, stigma and transactional distance, explain 41.5 percent of the propensity to use services from lending fintechs in brazil"
2019-0006,0,financial technology (fintech) services using emerging technology such as the internet of things (iot) is becoming more prevalent
2019-0006,1,the recent proliferation of the mobile payment sector led by innovative mobile fintech payment services such as apple pay and samsung pay is the most important and fastest growing fintech services from consumers perspective
2019-0006,2,"although businesses have been making efforts to spread the use of the services, security is crucial in the diffusion of the services"
2019-0006,3,"despite the importance, the role of perceived security in continuous intention to use mobile, fintech services has not yet been investigated in depth"
2019-0006,4,"thus, this study investigates the relationships between perceived security, knowledge regarding the services, confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction"
2019-0006,5,we propose a research model using an extended post-acceptance model (epam) as a theoretical framework in the context of fintech services
2019-0006,6,we then validate the model using the data collected from the service users
2019-0006,7,the analyzed results show that knowledge and perceived security in mobile fintech services have a significant influence on users confirmation and perceived usefulness
2019-0006,8,"however, perceived security does not directly influence users satisfaction and continual intention to use"
2019-0006,9,"we further find significant relationships among confirmation, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and continual intention to use of the services"
2019-0006,10,we discuss theoretical and practical contributions of the study
2019-0000,0,we investigate the economic and technological determinants inducing entrepreneurs to establish ventures with the purpose of reinventing financial technology (fintech)
2019-0000,1,we find that countries witness more fintech startup formations when the economy is well-developed and venture capital is readily available
2019-0000,2,"furthermore, the number of secure internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, and the available labor force has a positive impact on the development of this new market segment"
2019-0000,3,"finally, the more difficult it is for companies to access loans, the higher is the number of fintech startups in a country"
2019-0000,4,"overall, the evidence suggests that fintech startup formation need not be left to chance, but active policies can influence the emergence of this new sector"
2019-0035,0,this chapter examines how fintech is breaking barriers to financial inclusion
2019-0035,1,it first traces the history of fintech and its evolution both globally and in africa
2019-0035,2,then it reviews the impact of selected fintech products in african countries
2019-0035,3,several observations are noteworthy
2019-0035,4,"first, mobile money facilitated by mobile technology stands out as the most successful innovation in extending financial inclusion in africa"
2019-0035,5,"second, the most promising innovation that has the potential to alleviate sme funding constraints is crowdfunding"
2019-0035,6,"however, this potential can only be realized by increasing internet access in africa, the region with the lowest penetration"
2019-0035,7,"finally, the chapter discusses the challenges facing the proliferation of fintech investments in africa"
2019-0076,0,"in light of inevitable cross-border scenarios in today's highly interconnected financial markets and since financial stability may be put at risk by the rising phenomenon of financial technology (known as fintech), the importance of developing effective ways to regulate fintech across borders cannot be neglected"
2019-0076,1,the financial sector has changed from a traditional one marked by conventional financial intermediation structures towards an increasingly technology-affected one
2019-0076,2,"not only this change but anticipated developments too require if not extensively reconsidering the design of financial regulation,1 then at least not turning a blind eye to shaping developments"
2019-0076,3,whether the numerous recently sprouting bilateral fintech cooperation agreements are adequate transnational regulatory instruments to address fintech effectively across borders is for this paper to elucidate
2019-0015,0,fintech is the hottest topic in finance today
2019-0015,1,"recent advances in cryptography, data analytics, and machine learning are visibly ""disrupting"" traditional methods of delivering financial services and conducting financial transactions"
2019-0015,2,"less visibly, fintech is also changing the way we think about finance: it is gradually recasting our collective understanding of the financial system in normatively neutral terms of applied information science"
2019-0015,3,"by making financial transactions easier, faster, and cheaper, fintech seems to promise a micro-level ""win-win "" solution to the financial system's many ills"
2019-0015,4,"this article challenges such narratives and presents an alternative account of fintech as a systemic, macro-level phenomenon"
2019-0015,5,"grounding the analysis of evolving fintech trends in a broader institutional context, the article exposes the normative and political significance of fintech as the catalyst for a potentially decisive shift in the underlying public-private balance of powers, competencies, and roles in the financial system"
2019-0015,6,"in developing this argument, the article makes three principal scholarly contributions"
2019-0015,7,"first, it introduces the concept of the new deal settlement in finance: a fundamental political arrangement, in force for nearly a century, pursuant to which profit-seeking private actors retain control over allocating capital and generating financial risks,1 while the sovereign public bears responsibility for maintaining systemic financial stability"
2019-0015,8,"second, the article advances a novel conceptual framework for understanding the deep-seated dynamics that have eroded the new deal settlement in recent decades"
2019-0015,9,"it offers a taxonomy of core mechanisms that both (a) enable private actors to continuously synthesize tradable financial assets and scale up trading activities, and (b) undermine the public's ability to manage the resulting system-wide risks"
2019-0015,10,"finally, the article shows how and why specific fintech applications-cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger technologies, digital crowdfunding, and robo-advising-are poised to amplify the effect of these destabilizing mechanisms, and thus potentially exacerbate the tensions and imbalances in today's financial markets and the broader economy"
2019-0015,11,it is this potential that renders fintech a public policy challenge of the highest order
2019-0064,0,aim: the paper attempts to assess the fundamentals of business model and its classification
2019-0064,1,"also it explores the basics of financial innovation, emerging banking technologies and enhance rich insights from the case of innovative gojek business model"
2019-0064,2,methodology: qualitative approach is utilized to understand the fundamentals of business model from secondary sources focused on literature review
2019-0064,3,"also to explore the various benchmark aspects of business model, innovation, technology adoption the paper draws secondary data from the various related journals, conference proceedings, news bulletins and similar forums"
2019-0064,4,"the various enabling banking technologies of new age business models are also identified from secondary sources especially technology based journals, banking forums and related sources"
2019-0064,5,major findings: a bm is comprised of two fundamental elements namely the value proposition (what is offered and to whom) and the operation model (how do we generate profit by delivering the offering)
2019-0064,6,the hype cycle and related discussion on business processes explains in depth the various aspects of technology adoption in bms
2019-0064,7,"in the context of discussion on business modelling, financial innovation can be categorized based on innovations in product process and risk-shifting"
2019-0064,8,"hybrid cloud, api platforms, robotic process automation (rpa), blockchain, instant payments, prescriptive security, artificial intelligence (ai), augmented and virtual reality, smart machines and quantum computing are some of the latest fintech to mention in the context of banking and financial services industry"
2019-0064,9,the gojek business model is explored to comprehend the delicate aspects of business model innovation and understand the grass roots strategic approach adopted by the model
2019-0103,0,"the rise of fintech startups and the broadening ambitions of the worlds digital titans are putting increased pressure on traditional banks, insurers, and other players"
2019-0103,1,"customers no longer expect their bank to provide the best digital experience (dx) amongst its peers, but amongst all the organizations they interact with"
2019-0103,2,"due to a plethora of data, fintech startups have gained significant grip, by introducing innovative and successfully offering products and distinctive solutions for consumer demand, efficiently and conveniently at lower transaction cost"
2019-0103,3,"in view of increased number of digitally enlighten customer and rising adoption rate of fintecc, the banks and fintech firms should not view as a rivalry to each other but as collaborative partner on the grounds of their relevance and interdependence"
2019-0103,4,"the paper discussed the rationality behind collaborations of banks with fintech startups, challenges and supportive environment"
2019-0044,0,"testing of distributed systems is a complex task, which is hampered by the impossibility of guaranteed reproduction of errors associated with race conditions"
2019-0044,1,"even minor instrumentation of the system significantly changes its characteristics, which becomes critical, especially for load testing"
2019-0044,2,all of that increases the importance of quality control methods based on the system log analysis
2019-0044,3,"in this paper, we present our experience of semi-automated analysis of the behavior of clearing and settlement system by utilizing its logs for the purpose of identifying and classifying errors"
2019-0001,0,we provide large-scale evidence on the occurrence and value of fintech innovation
2019-0001,1,"using data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify innovations by their underlying technologies"
2019-0001,2,"we find that most fintech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable"
2019-0001,3,"for the overall financial sector, internet of things (iot), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types"
2019-0001,4,"innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect"
2019-0001,5,"(jel g14, g20, g29, g39)"
2019-0004,0,"fintech is about the introduction of new technologies into the financial sector, and it is now revolutionizing the financial industry"
2019-0004,1,"in 2017, when the academic finance community was not actively researching fintech, the editorial team of the review of financial studies launched a competition to develop research proposals focused on this topic"
2019-0004,2,this special issue is the result
2019-0004,3,"in this introductory article, we describe the recent fintech phenomenon and the novel editorial protocol employed for this special issue following the registered reports format.we discuss what we learned from the submitted proposals about the field of fintech and which ones we selected to be completed and ultimately come out in this special issue"
2019-0004,4,we also provide several observations to help guide future research in the emerging area of fintech
2019-0004,5,"(jel g00, g21, g23, g28, l51, o31)"
2019-0056,0,"as the number of devices and platforms gradually increased that serve as a medium for online banking services, the number of replicated services for different platforms also increase"
2019-0056,1,each service has a different representation in a different platform even though targeting the same business objectives
2019-0056,2,this situation results in the problem of re-developing similar set of requirements for different devices and services which in turn results in multiplied effort in software development and degradation in the software quality because of the replicated code
2019-0056,3,the objective of this paper is to present a device independent user interface development approach that eliminates the replicated user interface development effort of the same set of services for different platforms/devices while increasing the presentation performance
2019-0056,4,"in this context, we provide a basic technique that uses a json based user interface definition format, called omni-script, to separate the representation of banking services in different platforms/devices, so called channels"
2019-0056,5,"omni-script is a pioneering solution being used in a real development environment in banking software domain that is experiencing a shift towards omni-channel user experience, where users are able to seamlessly continue using banking services in different platforms and devices"
2019-0056,6,"as the evaluation method, we have measured the actual development effort on a representative sample development team and a set of services"
2019-0056,7,"additionally, we later deployed and measured the rendering time and the amount of data communication for the proposed approach in a real production environment"
2019-0056,8,production deployment resulted in a remarkable decrease in data communication and in loading times at the client side
2019-0056,9,"as importantly, the proposed approach also resulted in a nearly 75% decrease in service development time by enabling analysts to produce user interface prototypes that can be integrated to service development with minimal effort"
2019-0028,0,"this practitioner note proposes a new approach considering two-stage clustering and lrfmp model (length, recency, frequency, monetary and periodicity) simultaneously for customer segmentation and behavior analysis and applies it among the iranian fintech companies"
2019-0028,1,"in this practitioner note, the k-means clustering algorithm and lrfmp model are combined in the customer segmentation process"
2019-0028,2,"after initial clustering, for a better understanding of valuable customers, additional clustering is implemented in segments that needed further investigation"
2019-0028,3,this approach contributes to a better interpretation of different customer segments
2019-0028,4,"customer segments, consisting of 23524 business customers are analysed based on their characteristics and appropriate strategies are recommended accordingly"
2019-0028,5,the first stage clustering result shows that customers are best segmented into four groups
2019-0028,6,the first and fourth segments are clustered again and the final 11 groups of customers are determined
2019-0028,7,"this note provides a systematic and practical approach for researchers and practitioners for segmentation, interpretation, and targeting of customers especially in the b2b setting and the fintech industry and helps managers to make effective marketing strategies and enhance customer relationship and marketing intelligence"
2019-0054,0,financial inclusion and inclusive growth is the clarion call given by nations all across the globe as they become increasingly aware that growth is more sustainable when it is inclusive

2019-0041,5,"concurrently, while fintech has a very broad and massive technical and managerial impact, it does not mean that incumbent banks and traditional financial services cannot compete"
2019-0116,0,the paper is a modest attempt to explore the innovative fintech business models and the significance of financial institutions
2019-0116,1,fintechs are companies that combine technological and financial attributes in their business models
2019-0116,2,"in recent years, the rise of fintech has attracted much attention since they challenge incumbent financial service companies including the traditional banking model"
2019-0116,3,"innovative fintech business models are bitcoin, tag cash, oradian, satago, simple tax, transfer wise, holvi and trdata able to become a success because they could reach out to a humungous global market"
2019-0116,4,"however, the growth in fintech industry has not spurred up only because of small-scale entrepreneurs"
2019-0116,5,the role of major financial industries cannot be neglected in this regard
2019-0116,6,the entrepreneurs work at small-scale in the fintech industry
2019-0116,7,they have the capacity to bear the risk of failure in a better way as compared to the major financial institutions
2019-0116,8,financial institutions work entirely on public trust
2019-0116,9,they are highly regulated by the financial authorities in order to add up to their reliability
2019-0116,10,"these financial institutions are answerable to the public for all their operations and therefore, they have to closely guard their investment choices"

2019-0046,3,the study provides useful implications to support the fintech landscape of the banking industry
2019-0117,0,nowadays fintect has been transformed from fintect1.0 to fintect2.0
2019-0117,1,"in the recent years, china has seen that the internet finance was first included in the government work report which was written into the thirteen five plan"
2019-0117,2,"biometrics, language processing, block chain and other technology applied to the financial do bring divinity to the entire financial system"

2019-0119,0,[no abstract available
2019-0011,0,"whether in response to robo advising, artificial intelligence, or cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, regulators around the world have made it a top policy priority to supervise the exponential growth of financial technology (or fintech) in the post-crisis era"
2019-0011,1,"however, applying traditional regulatory strategies to new technological ecosystems has proved conceptually difficult"
2019-0011,2,"part of the challenge lies in managing the trade-offs that accompany the regulation of innovations that could, conceivably, both help and hurt consumers as well as market participants"
2019-0011,3,problems also arise from the common assumption that today's fintech is a mere continuation of the story of innovation that has shaped finance for centuries
2019-0011,4,this article offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and regulating fintech by showing how the supervision of financial innovation is invariably bound by what can be described as a policy trilemma
2019-0011,5,"specifically, we argue that when seeking to provide clear rules, maintain market integrity, and encourage financial innovation, regulators have long been able to achieve, at best, only two out of these three goals"
2019-0011,6,"moreover, today's innovations exacerbate the trade-offs historically embodied in the trilemma by breaking down financial services supply chains into discrete parts and disintermediating traditional functions using cutting edge, but untested, technologies, thereby introducing unprecedented uncertainty as to their risks and benefits"
2019-0011,7,"this article seeks to catalogue the strategies taken by regulatory authorities to navigate the trilemma, and posits them as operating across a spectrum of interrelated responses"
2019-0011,8,"the article then proposes supplemental administrative tools to support not only market, but also regulatory experimentation and innovation"
2019-0120,0,"in the last years, the term financial technology (fintech) has been adopted by literature to describe a wide range of services, aided by several financial technologies, for enterprises or organizations, which mainly address the improvement of the service quality by using information technology (it) applications"

2019-0061,0,financial technology (fintech) is considered a taxonomy that describes a wide range of ict (information and communications technology) associated with financial transactions and related operations
2019-0061,1,"improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts"
2019-0061,2,"due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other fintech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering"
2019-0061,3,"this paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process"
2019-0061,4,"with a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation"

2019-0038,0,a large shift towards the use of agile software development in different industrial sectors is evident nowadays
2019-0038,1,financial institutions are not unfamiliar with this tendency since they have the need to respond faster to the changes in their business environments
2019-0038,2,this is partly due to the new generation of financial technology (fintech) companies that have shown a significant difference in time to market and in speeding up software development
2019-0038,3,"to compete with fintech companies, financial institutions are looking for improving their software development processes focusing on applying agile practices in a better way"
2019-0038,4,this article presents a set of proposals to improve software development in the lhv bank
2019-0038,5,the set of proposals has been determined through a literature review and interviews conducted in two leading financial institutions and two fintech companies
2019-0038,6,"the analysis done allowed us to understand the best practices that are currently being applied, how they are implemented, and which ones are suitable for application in lhv bank"
2019-0121,0,"this paper presents the random neural network in a deep learning cluster structure with a new learning algorithm based on the genome model, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves"
2019-0121,1,the proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons
2019-0121,2,"the innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: reinforcement learning takes fast and local decisions, deep learning clusters provide identity and memory, deep learning management clusters take final strategic decisions and finally genetic learning transmits the learned information to future generations"
2019-0121,3,"this structure has been applied and validated in fintech, a bitcoin smart investment application based in an intelligent banker that performs buy and sell decisions on several cryptocurrencies with an associated exchange and risk"
2019-0121,4,our results are promising
2019-0121,5,"we have connected the human brain and genetics with machine learning based on the random neural network model where artificial intelligence, similar as biology, is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment"
2019-0043,0,"motivated by recently introduced retail payment schemes using information technology, often called fintech, we examine the effect of fraud liability regime on antifraud investment in a fintech payment scheme, where the front-end and back-end services are vertically separated"
2019-0043,1,"in an environment where a fintech payment service provider (fpp) covers only the front-end services, delegating the back-end services to an integrated payment service provider (ipp) such as banks and credit card companies, we show that under the ipp liability regime, the ipp invests more in general, while the respective investment depends on the range of the access fee under the fpp liability regime"
2019-0043,2,"specifically, given a sufficiently great loss from accident, if the access fee is in a certain range, the fpp liability regime is superior in terms of antifraud investment"
2019-0043,3,"when the fpp makes its indirect revenue from its user base in addition to the revenue from user fees, we can observe greater antifraud investment under both liability regimes, but the overall decrease in fraud probability is higher under the ipp liability regime"
2019-0043,4,"our results suggest that it might be desirable to induce fpp liability regime, which might necessitate regulating the access fee to achieve such an outcome"

2018-0054,0,european microfinance suffers from a visibility deficit
2018-0054,1,it is rarely mentioned in the media
2018-0054,2,our research question is why does european microfinance suffer from a lack of visibility in the press? this study looked at news reports and press releases over a 18-month period (20162018) to check if european microfinance and its innovations were in the news
2018-0054,3,"the study finds that, indeed, there are a lot of new innovations in finance"
2018-0054,4,"but, first, in europe, the highly talked about fintech innovations are taking place outside of microfinance institutions (mfis)"
2018-0054,5,"second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of europe"
2018-0054,6,the study followed this up by examining websites of some of the leading european fintech firms to see what they were doing that made them so visible
2018-0054,7,"we share some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to mfis in diverse sectors such as mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, atms and management information systems"
2018-0054,8,"to become visible, european microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that helps it reduce costs, increase outreach and, thus, have an impact"
2018-0054,9,forii such as the european microfinance network and the european microfinance platform need to promote these innovations by offering appropriate awards

2018-0006,0,"based on a systematic review of influential publications among 402 papers published between 2010 and 2018, this paper identifies gaps in economics and finance research regarding two applications of fintech: crowdfunding and blockchain"
2018-0006,1,analysing these records shows that (i) current research on fintech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding
2018-0006,2,(ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways
2018-0006,3,"(iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation"
2018-0006,4,"(iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries"
2018-0006,5,and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all

2018-0002,2,"difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burdencapital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to office of comptroller and currency following closure of the office of thrift supervisionall reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints"
2018-0002,3,shadow banks partially filled these gaps
2018-0002,4,"relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market"
2018-0002,5,fintech lenders charge a premium of 1416 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers
2018-0002,6,they seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders
2018-0002,7,"a quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%"

2018-0004,11,disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change
2018-0004,12,we contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications
2018-0004,13,we also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain
2018-0004,14,the aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration

2018-0010,2,banks with assets over $50 billion to examine whether the fintech lending platform could expand credit access to consumers
2018-0010,3,"we find that lendingclub's consumer lending activities have penetrated areas that may be underserved by traditional banks, such as in highly concentrated markets and areas that have fewer bank branches per capita"
2018-0010,4,we also find that the portion of lendingclub loans increases in areas where the local economy is not performing well
2018-0082,0,"fintech, short for ""financial technology,"" has advanced the process of transforming financial business from a traditional manualprocess- driven to an automation-driven model by providing various software platforms"
2018-0082,1,"however, the current fintech-industry still heavily depends on manual testing, which becomes the bottleneck of fintech industry development"
2018-0082,2,"to automate the testing process, we propose an approach of black-box testing for a fin- tech system with effective tool support for both test generation and test oracles"
2018-0082,3,"for test generation, we first extract input categories from business-logic specifications, and then mutate real data collected from system logs with values randomly picked from each extracted input category"
2018-0082,4,"for test oracles, we propose a new technique of priority differential testing where we evaluate execution results of system-test inputs on the system's head (i.e., latest) version in the version repository (1) against the last legacy version in the version repository (only when the executed test inputs are on new, not-yet-deployed services) and (2) against both the currently-deployed version and the last legacy version (only when the test inputs are on existing, deployed services)"
2018-0082,5,"when we rank the behavior-inconsistency results for developers to inspect, for the latter case, we give the currently-deployed version as a higherpriority source of behavior to check"
2018-0082,6,"we apply our approach to the cstp subsystem, one of the largest data processing and forwarding modules of the china foreign exchange trade system (cfets) platform, whose annual total transaction volume reaches 150 trillion us dollars"
2018-0082,7,"extensive experimental results show that our approach can substantially boost the branch coverage by approximately 40%, and is also efficient to identify common faults in the fintech system"
2018-0098,0,the recent increase in research on financial technology has resulted in transactions receiving considerable research attention
2018-0098,1,"with the increasing importance of bitcoin, many related topics require further clarification"
2018-0098,2,"because bitcoin is a popular financial asset, determining whether the price information is fully circulated among trading platforms has been the focus of many studies in recent years"
2018-0098,3,the method for verifying the efficient market hypothesis relates to whether the price series is a random walk
2018-0098,4,"that is, whether a unit root exists"
2018-0098,5,"according to the literature, whether the price of bitcoin satisfies the efficient market hypothesis remains controversial"
2018-0098,6,"however, these studies have not considered nonlinear data structures"
2018-0098,7,"to deal with the structural change of data, this study employed different unit root tests, namely the zivot-andrews unit root test and kapetanios-shin unit root test, to investigate bitcoins' relationship to the efficient market hypothesis"
2018-0098,8,"if the efficient market hypothesis is validated, the price formed by the bitcoin trading platform is close to a perfectly competitive mechanism, and the information can be quickly and completely reflected in the price, with information of different trading platforms having mutual influence"
2018-0098,9,"therefore, this study applied the threshold vector autoregressive model to explore price information transmission between various trading platforms"
2018-0098,10,the contribution of this research is its exploration of the financial tools derived from the highly developed fields of financial science and technology
2018-0098,11,this is helpful for providing new methods for completing financial transactions or a platform for speculators to engage in arbitrage
2018-0079,0,japanese digital consumer electronics manufacturer declined and collapsed
2018-0079,1,it is said that the cause is the modularization of technology in architecture theory
2018-0079,2,"there is a japanese industry that is similarly undergoing modularization, which is the financial industry"
2018-0079,3,this paper clarified that fintech modularizes financial technology
2018-0079,4,"for that purpose, we analyzed the function and structure of fintech"
2018-0079,5,"also, although it is possible that fintech could change the existing financial industry structure in japan, the objective was to propose from the case consideration that the management strategy in that environment is keystone strategy"
2018-0079,6,"as a conclusion, fintech was found to be modularized because it has increased its added value after fragmenting financial services technology and breaking it apart"
2018-0079,7,"in addition, even if it continues to stay in the integral part, its comprehensive financial services part is inferior to fintech, so it was expected that it cannot stay in the integral"
2018-0052,0,"technological innovation, recent regulatory initiatives and mass consumers' changing expectations are quickly re-shaping the payments' sector, paving the way to a more open environment where even non-banking players see a huge opportunity to gain momentum and disrupt the incumbents, namely the financial institutions"
2018-0052,1,"fintech startups, high-tech firms but also mobile network operators are indeed challenging the status quo with their innovative propositions, trying to disintermediate banks from their traditional function of payment service providers"
2018-0052,2,"in the payments market, mobile wallets represent one of the innovations with highest potential of growth in the consumer-to-business segment"
2018-0052,3,payment market is a large and profitable segment for retail banking
2018-0052,4,"besides revenue streams from card payment transactions, new sources of revenueas and value creation have been unleashed by digital payments"
2018-0052,5,"this paper contributes to provide a better understanding of the mobile wallet ecosystem, also analyzing a set of four business cases so to identify potential sources of competitive advantage for retail banks in a market characterized by an increased non-bank competition"
2018-0052,6,mobile wallet platforms can be a powerful tool for banks to cope with the customer-centric approach

2018-0060,0,"fintech, the merging of finance and modern internet-based technology, has rapidly presented itself as a disruptor to traditional business financing, notably in the form of crowdfunding and peer-to-peer (p2p) lending"
2018-0060,1,"in this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of fintech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance"
2018-0060,2,"using a comprehensive sample of chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), we find that state-owned enterprises (soes) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek fintech finance"
2018-0060,3,"in the chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which soe smes can access cheaper conventional finance through soe banks"
2018-0060,4,the quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of fintech financing
2018-0060,5,"as for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by rd activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of fintech finance for innovative high-growth firms"
2018-0078,0,"disruption technologies, blockchain, fintech  already not new anymore, as a fashion in disrupting technologies, fintech became for years pretty well known as an insertion of high tech in the financial service industry"
2018-0078,1,"but  as already mentioned in my previous paper work on this topic  banking and other financial services, more and more developed under the absorption of the new tech attack, didnt change too much inside the corporations, and i was referring especially at the transforming of the finance function over there"
2018-0078,2,"and this transformation does not simply require the deeper immersion of new and high tech inside the finance of companies, though it matters first, rather than the preparation of people to support this"
2018-0072,0,the purpose of the study was too disruptive technology
2018-0072,1,the rapid changes in technology due to the innovation has brought an impacts in changes on human lifestyle

2018-0072,7,"the second phenomenon is digital technology has been able to change the behavior of indonesian people in all aspects of life, such as electronic books, electronic newspapers, online sales and public transportation (taxis and motorcycles)"
2018-0072,8,"the third phenomenon is fintechs services in indonesia include payment channel system, digital banking, online/digital insurance, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending and crow funding"
2018-0072,9,banks should be able to balance the development of this digital technology by providing new products that are close to customer's wishes
2018-0072,10,there is a gap that has not been served by banks in indonesia that resulted in the emergence of potential benefits that can be taken by start-up company (pioneer) fintech in providing services and banking products
2018-0072,11,banking in indonesia can synergize with start-up companies (pioneer) fintech by changing its business process by doing business process reengineering (bpr)
2018-0073,0,"with the deep application and development of information technology in the financial field, fintech (financial technology) has become a hot topic in the financial industry and the scientific and technological community"

2018-0025,1,fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially
2018-0025,2,"it could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence"
2018-0025,3,lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces
2018-0025,4,"yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the european union (eu)"
2018-0025,5,"even the largest fintech market, in china, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation"
2018-0025,6,"in the eu, much of fintech is concentrated in the uk"
2018-0025,7,we argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently
2018-0025,8,(i) develop a european or national fintech market? (ii) what regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) should supervision of fintech be exercised at the european level? (iv) what is the overall vision for the eu's financial system? getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system
2018-0025,9,"in contrast, late action could mean that europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in europe"
2018-0080,0,"fintech, which is a shorthand expression for financial technology, is basically referring to all the technological innovations in the financial sector that started to develop exponentially, especially in the second decade of the 21st century, in the era of the mobile internet revolution"

2018-0080,2,"the current generation of students, born about twenty years ago, is part of this cohort and this is why we decided to initiate a study regarding their perception and behavior concerning the fintech area with the help of a questionnaire applied on some of the students of the faculty of european studies from babes-bolyai university"
2018-0080,3,"because the fintech is covering financial innovations from a very broad area (including cryptocurrency, online payments, financial transfers, openbanking, investments, regtech, insurtech, etc.) we decided to focus in this preliminary study, only on the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies and in relation to these, on the online payments"

2018-0016,0,manuscript type: empirical research question/issue: where are fintech venture capital investments taking place around the world? what is the role of institutional factors on the international allocation of fintech venture capital? research findings/insights: we document a notable change in the pattern of fintech venture capital (vc) investments around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis
2018-0016,1,we show that fintech venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the financial crisis
2018-0016,2,"also, we show the fintech boom is more pronounced for smaller private limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior venture capital booms and busts"
2018-0016,3,"these fintech vc deals are substantially more likely to be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center"
2018-0016,4,theoretical/academic implications: we build on the institutions and corporate governance literatures by showing the importance of enforcement in driving relative differences in investment patterns and investor participation
2018-0016,5,"for entrepreneurial startups, regulatory arbitrage drives investment into countries with a dearth of enforcement and regulatory costs"
2018-0016,6,we argue that the spike in fintech venture capital in certain countries is attributable to differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large established financial institutions after the financial crisis
2018-0016,7,practitioner/policy implications: regulatory arbitrage in the context of fintech venture capital can spur booms and busts
2018-0016,8,less experienced venture capitalists seem more prone to undertake investments that exacerbate boom and bust cycles
2018-0016,9,"national governance is strengthened by the enforcement of regulatory standards, and corporate governance through investor experience and oversight can mitigate these swings, and facilitate better investment outcomes"
2018-0032,0,financial technology (fintech) employs technological advancements and sharing economy models to improve financing services
2018-0032,1,the emergence of the internet-of-things (iot) has changed the way humans interact with the surrounding world
2018-0032,2,"in this paper, we present a proactive fintech model that uses the iot intelligence to deliver positive insurtech feedback"
2018-0032,3,"we propose an insurtech system with three main components: the monitoring and feedback device, the fog analytics engine, and the cloud server"
2018-0032,4,the driving analytics use sensor-recorded data to calculate in real time the driving scores based on current driving patterns and road conditions
2018-0032,5,the feedback device then communicates with drivers providing helpful feedbacks and potential rewards
2018-0032,6,"given assertive recommendations offered by a system, the rational-economic model suggests that humans usually respond positively to cost minimizations and rewards maximizations"
2018-0032,7,we have used real user data collected by the mapbar auto guard devices deployed in china to show an example of how iot supports the implementation of the positive feedback paradigm
2018-0032,8,we believe our proactive fintech model that speaks of actual costs and potential benefits in real time will offer an attractive service value and customer satisfaction

2018-0050,1,this exploration is based on findings from previous studies that suggest that trust and risk are important aspects in considering the use of fintech
2018-0050,2,the focus of this research is to develop and validate the research instruments that will be used next
2018-0050,3,the basic theory of model development uses the theory of technology acceptance model (tam) developed by davis
2018-0050,4,the models and instruments developed will be through pilot studies involving 133 communities as respondents
2018-0050,5,this study is quantitative research and data obtained were analyzed using smart pls v3.0

2018-0015,0,"the fintech revolution captures the simultaneous attack of a large number of technologies, notably mobile telephones and blockchain, which are ushering in efficiency or outreach to multiple niche markets"
2018-0015,1,"the use of mobile telephone technology has expanded internet reach to the excluded, created possibilities for business where banks were not historically present and is potentially disruptive"
2018-0015,2,the blockchain technology threatens to be even more disruptive as it may pull the carpet from under the monetary system as well as the property rights as we know them today
2018-0015,3,"the proliferation of actors and innovators has created a confused landscape resulting in different possible scenarios, where banks may freeze, fight, form alliances with challengers, or be forced into flight by the bigtech"
2018-0026,0,"in recent years, the new technological keywords, fintech and iot (internet of things) have attracted interest, and at the same time, as they have already become buzz words, a gap has appeared between technologies and services that will penetrate the market and those which will disappear"
2018-0026,1,recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies
2018-0026,2,"there is a requirement for fintech or iot to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself"
2018-0026,3,"while some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities"
2018-0026,4,"thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society"
2018-0026,5,"products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses"
2018-0026,6,this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation

2018-0057,2,"the method of this study is literature review in which we combine the theoretical perspective, lesson learned from some countries and indonesias experience"
2018-0057,3,we find that the collaboration model is feasible with some requirement
2018-0108,0,"the lack of innovation in financial services can be explained by the market domination and regulatory protection that incumbent banks have hitherto enjoyed, meaning that they have not needed to defend disruptive forces from fintechs, third parties or other banks"
2018-0108,1,"however, the era of lightweight innovation and limited advancements in payments technology is coming to an end"
2018-0108,2,"the revised payments services directive (psd2) gives third parties the opportunity to develop, launch and become the preferred payments channel in regions where no alternative exists"
2018-0108,3,increasing smartphone adoption and internet access will see mobile become the dominant channel for everyday purchases
2018-0108,4,"as payments are commoditised, the value of this channel is no longer limited to transaction fees"
2018-0108,5,"instead, it is derived from user volume and data.tech giants, such as facebook, google and apple, recognise that data equal power and have made evidential steps toward becoming payment powerhouses"
2018-0108,6,banks bring formidable strengths to the payments arena
2018-0108,7,there are considerable benefits and revenue sources available to those that mobilise their long-term payment channels
2018-0108,8,partnering with fintechs allows banks to quickly become agile and launch cost-efficient minimum viable products and to test new ideas

2018-0012,0,the financial crisis of 2008 has led to dramatic changes in the way that finance is regulated: the dodd-frank act imposed broad and systemic regulation on the industry on a level not seen since the new deal
2018-0012,1,but the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how they are provided
2018-0012,2,"regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or ""fintech"") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money itself"
2018-0012,3,these changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance
2018-0012,4,"in particular, this article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with ""too big to fail"" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small, decentralized financial markets"
2018-0012,5,"in many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky behavior by market participants"
2018-0012,6,the article concludes by sketching out a variety of regulatory responses that better correspond to fintech's particular risks and rewards
2018-0110,0,[no abstract available

2018-0111,2,"while another obvious option is a bank charter, few fintech firms have seriously considered bank charters due to a number of cost, compliance and other factors that make becoming a bank too burdensome"
2018-0111,3,"recent developments, however, suggest that the bank charter option may be worthy of reconsideration"
2018-0111,4,"this article explores the opportunities, costs, risks and other factors that fintech firms should weigh in considering a bank charter and various charter options currently available or in development in the united states"

2018-0095,0,fintech startups and services are one of the most dynamic segments of the modern economy
2018-0095,1,new financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets
2018-0095,2,"changing the traditional financial services concept, fintech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system"
2018-0095,3,the purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the fintech market on the example of ukraine
2018-0095,4,"in order to study the development of the fintech industry, a multiple regression model was presented"
2018-0095,5,"the model describes the dependence of the total investment value of fintech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending"
2018-0095,6,"based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new fintech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified"

2018-0058,4,"to understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and p2p crossborder money transfers with transferwise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined"
2018-0058,5,"for ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with fintech is a crucial challenge"
2018-0058,6,"that is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices"
2018-0058,7,a great example of cross-border payments of fintech in ukraine is transferwise
2018-0058,8,"the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (p2p) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period"
2018-0058,9,"by transforming existing cost structures and mitigating market imperfections, they provide innovative services that meet the users' needs for speed, trust, low cost, usability, security and transparency"

2018-0063,0,cryptocurrency market has been growing fast since its emergence in recent years
2018-0063,1,"moreover, digital finance has forged the convergence of profit motives with social objectives creating a class of large fintech companies"
2018-0063,2,"in addition, the underlying technology innovation may be applied to a wide range of industries, not limited to financial sector"
2018-0063,3,"yet, few researches have been done to study these phenomena"
2018-0063,4,"hence, it is the task of this book to shed light on the introduction and trends in fintech, blockchain and token sales"
2018-0063,5,"richly illustrated with original lecture slides taught by the authors, inclusive fintech: blockchain, cryptocurrency and ico hopes to dispel the many misconceptions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies (especially bitcoin, initial crypto-token offering or ico), as well as the idea that businesses can be sustainable without a social dimension going forward"
2018-0063,6,"with comprehensive coverage given to the fintech scene in asia, it is targeted at those who are searching for business opportunities"

2018-0092,1,"in particular, some typical examples of applying blockchain in financial technology (fintech) are discussed, including such as applying bitcoin to drive various new business services, and implementing smart contracts based on blockchain technology to oversee the execution of legal transactions in real time"
2018-0092,2,"in addition, a pioneer effort of building up a distributed-ledger consortium model is addressed in the near future work"
2018-0083,0,"the term financial technology (fintech) refers to firms that use technology-based systems either to provide financial services and products directly, or to make them more efficient"
2018-0083,1,"examples include internet banking, mobile payments, crowdfunding, robo-advice and virtual currencies"
2018-0083,2,"these applications show that the digital revolution is irreversibly changing the way people live, including the way they interact with the financial system"
2018-0083,3,the rapidly growing fintech sector has its rewards and challenges (e.g
2018-0083,4,"data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and has been increasingly attracting political attention at the supranational level"
2018-0083,5,"thus, the fundamental question of this paper is: how is the european union dealing with fintech? due to the broad scope of fintech, eu regulators face a dilemma: on the one hand, rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation"
2018-0083,6,"on the other hand, principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance"
2018-0083,7,a possible middle ground could be found by evolving towards a more dialectic supervisory model
2018-0093,0,"in this paper, we present experiences from eight years of developing a financial transaction engine, using what can be described as an integration-test-centric software development process"
2018-0093,1,we discuss the product and the relation between three different categories of its software and how the relative weight of these artifacts has varied over the years
2018-0093,2,"in addition to the presentation, some challenges and future research directions are discussed"
2018-0055,0,this paper proposes the random neural network with a new learning algorithm based on the genome model
2018-0055,1,"following genetics, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves, the proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons"
2018-0055,2,"the innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: reinforcement learning takes fast local current decisions, deep learning clusters provide identity and memory, deep learning management clusters take final strategic decisions and finally genetic learning transmits the information learned to future generations"
2018-0055,3,the presented algorithm and deep learning structure has been applied and validated in a fintech model
2018-0055,4,"a smart investment application where an intelligent bankers are specialised in buy and sell decisions on several assets, markets and risks"
2018-0055,5,the obtained results are promising
2018-0055,6,the proposed model combines human brain and genetics with deep learning structure based on the random neural network model where biology
2018-0055,7,similar as artificial intelligence is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment
2018-0046,0,"background: since the global financial crisis, banks have been exposed to new opportunities and threats unprecedented in history driven fundamentally by technology"
2018-0046,1,"so-called fintech disruptors are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition"
2018-0046,2,"as banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies"
2018-0046,3,aim: to identify the strategic implications of fintech on south african retail banks
2018-0046,4,setting: the study is conducted in the south african retail banking industry
2018-0046,5,methods: a post-positivist paradigm approach that is qualitative in nature
2018-0046,6,"results: there are several main findings: firstly, technology-based skills are becoming mandatory for staff and regulators alike"
2018-0046,7,"secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy"
2018-0046,8,"thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past"
2018-0046,9,"fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions"
2018-0046,10,"finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable"
2018-0046,11,"conclusion: by adapting to the fintech revolution, south african retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive"

2018-0121,1,the biggest problems of the digital signature technologies are delegation/lending/duplication
2018-0121,2,"in this study, we propose a new approach method which use the tee area in the smart phones and it based on non-face-to-face identification and digital signature method"
2018-0121,3,suggested method is requiring no specific device except smart phones
2018-0121,4,the biometric information and personal data of the user are stored in the safe tee within the smart phone
2018-0121,5,"in our method, the key generation and digital signature are also, conducted in tee, we can prevent to various types of attack including sniffing and man-in-the-middle attack"
2018-0121,6,"also, because all of the processes are conducted in tee, the all transactions can be protected against malicious users"
2018-0009,0,purpose: the purpose of this paper is to better understand why people are willing or hesitant to use financial technology (fintech) as well as to determine whether the effect of perceived benefits and risks of continuance intention differs depending on user types
2018-0009,1,design/methodology/approach: original data were collected via a survey of 243 participants with fintech usage experience
2018-0009,2,the partial least squares method was used to test the proposed model
2018-0009,3,"findings: the results reveal that legal risk had the most negative effect on the fintech continuance intention, while convenience had the strongest positive effect"
2018-0009,4,differences in specific benefit and risk impacts are found between early and late adopters
2018-0009,5,originality/value: this empirical study contributes to the novel understanding of the benefit and risk factors affecting the fintech continuance intention
2018-0017,0,"finance startups are offering automated advice, touchless payments, and other products that could bring great societal benefits, including lower prices and expanded access to credit"
2018-0017,1,"yet unlike in other digital arenas in which american companies are global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the united states lags in consumer financial technology"
2018-0017,2,this article posits that the current competition policy framework is holding back consumer financial innovation
2018-0017,3,it then identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional design of federal regulators
2018-0017,4,competition authority-including antitrust and the extension of business licenses-is spread across at least five agencies
2018-0017,5,each is focused on other missions or industries
2018-0017,6,"the department of justice (doj), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential regulators"
2018-0017,7,"the federal reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate"
2018-0017,8,"no agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote consumer financial competition"
2018-0017,9,"innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries"
2018-0017,10,"if allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (""fintechs"") could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of ""too big to fail"" banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis"
2018-0017,11,"if allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market dominance seen in google, facebook, and amazon, thereby increasing systemic risk"
2018-0017,12,"whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation"
2018-0018,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to empirically analyse the key factors that influence the adoption of financial technology innovation in the country germany
2018-0018,1,the advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (fintech) innovation
2018-0018,2,"financial sectors and startups see fintech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities"
2018-0018,3,mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and fintech innovators
2018-0018,4,"in this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt fintech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and fintech promotion"
2018-0018,5,"the empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of fintech"
2018-0018,6,existing studies have used the technology acceptance model (tam) to address this issue
2018-0018,7,the outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of fintech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity
2018-0018,8,"design/methodology/approach: in this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting fintech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and fintech promotion"
2018-0018,9,"the results confirm that customer trust, data security and the user design interface affect the adoption of fintech"
2018-0018,10,"this research proposes a model called intention to adopt fintech in germany, constructs of which were developed based on the tam and five additional components, as identified"
2018-0018,11,the outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of fintech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity
2018-0018,12,findings: the authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in germany is rapidly increasing
2018-0018,13,yet the adoption of fintech is extremely sluggish
2018-0018,14,"it is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized fintech"
2018-0018,15,"further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used fintech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents"
2018-0018,16,it is obvious that the fintech incubators and banks offering fintech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of fintech
2018-0018,17,this study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke fintech adoption
2018-0018,18,research limitations/implications: there are a few limitations in this study
2018-0018,19,"initially, this study focuses on fintech implementation in germany and not the whole of europe"
2018-0018,20,"in addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use fintech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology"
2018-0018,21,"without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the fintech adoption process"
2018-0018,22,future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model
2018-0018,23,"additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the german population"
2018-0018,24,"to accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential"
2018-0018,25,the authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to fintech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies
2018-0018,26,"practical implications: this study was conducted in germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment"
2018-0018,27,"for instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the united kingdom, where take-up of fintech appears to be far greater than in germany"
2018-0018,28,"therefore, the authors results are only generalized for the country of germany and not other geographical areas"
2018-0018,29,"furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about fintech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions"
2018-0018,30,"in spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and fintech services experience"
2018-0018,31,"the authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability"
2018-0018,32,"accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on fintech use"
2018-0018,33,social implications: the outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of fintech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity
2018-0018,34,"the authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage fintech innovators in their approach to fintech and enable fintech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future"

2018-0123,1,"across europe there is no common practice of using the credit data of consumers, which can be exploited for several purposes"
2018-0123,2,"traditionally, they are used by the lending industry as a risk-management tool to underwrite borrowing decisions or price risks, but they can also be used as a practice of creditworthiness assessment"
2018-0123,3,"in some member states, consumer data are part of a broader information centralisation system for the prudential supervision of banks and the financial system as a whole"
2018-0123,4,"within this already complex picture, emerging technologies and the processing of new generations of personal data are starting to give way to new business models that can transform retail financial markets (fintechs)"
2018-0123,5,"whatever the function the data perform, their source, type, breath, and depth differ greatly from country to country"
2018-0123,6,"unlike for the harmonisation of eu rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonised legal framework"
2018-0123,7,"likewise, the establishment of the banking union and the prudential supervision of the euro-area demand standardisation and convergence of the data used to measure debt levels, arrears, and delinquencies"
2018-0123,8,"the many functions and different usages of credit data suggest that the policy goals to be achieved should inform the design and structure of the databases, as well as the role, legal, and institutional framework of the organisations managing the data system (the data brokers)"

2017-0008,3,we relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods
2017-0008,4,results: our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in fintech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks
2017-0008,5,"conclusions: although these results suggest complementarity between fintech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant"
2017-0008,6,"since the fintech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious"

2017-0011,13,the model can also help track the progress and pattern of technology development and diffusion
2017-0011,14,"therefore, the model can be used to project the trend and diffusion of innovation competition in the banking industry"
2017-0009,0,"there is a growing competition between banks and fintech not only in advanced economies, but also in the emerging markets"
2017-0009,1,"however, it is yet to be observed in latvia to the same extent"
2017-0009,2,this paper aims to evaluate fintech's level of development in latvia compared to europe
2017-0009,3,"the paper identifies financial services using innovative technologies offered by fintech companies, analyses the advantages and disadvantages of these services in comparison with services offered by the traditional financial sector companies (banks, insurance companies, institutions involved in asset management and investment, etc.), and evaluates how prepared are consumers to use fintech services"
2017-0009,4,"this paper documents the results of the survey aiming to clarify how well-informed consumers in latvia are about fintech services, their convenience, speed and safety, as well as the consumers' current satisfaction with banking services"
2017-0009,5,"the hypothesis of this paper is that latvian society is not ready to use services provided by fintech, but prefers banking services instead"
2017-0009,6,survey results provide some evidence in favour of this hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally unaware about fintech services in latvia and their associated innovations and new financial products
2017-0009,7,"this paper makes several recommendations for managers of fintech enterprises, association of start-up enterprises and risk capital funds as well as state institutions"
2017-0019,0,"the recent growth of financial technology ventures involves several types of financial players, including stock exchanges"
2017-0019,1,"many of them are exploring blockchain applications to their multiple business lines, focusing in particular on post trading activities"
2017-0019,2,potential benefits include the reduction in counterparty risk and post trading costs as well as the increase of liquidity and transparency
2017-0019,3,"at current stage exchanges are mainly exploring the technology looking for proofs of concept, with the exception of some more advanced projects like at nasdaq and asx"
2017-0019,4,"the mass adoption will require longer efforts and is expected to come in a decade, at least"
2017-0019,5,"fintech developments are receiving strong attention also by regulators and international organizations, given the potential of distributed ledger technology for both competition enhancement and cyber risk reduction"
2017-0019,6,"a coordination between market players and regulators is essential to guarantee the effective implementation of new technologies, as their benefits can be delivered only in presence of a common framework and a proper management of risks"
2017-0014,0,purpose: this paper aims to explore how the regulator of a global financial centre (gfc) under an international trend of adopting emerging technologies for financial services (fintech) articulates such opportunities and risks strategically
2017-0014,1,"design/methodology/approach: with a literature review on the global regulatory environment and the underlying risks related to fintech, it looks into the formulation and implementation of complementary regulatory policies in the case of hong kong as a gfc"
2017-0014,2,relevant policy documents disclosed by the financial regulator on cybersecurity and pertinent issues are examined
2017-0014,3,"findings: adopting a strategic approach that seizes opportunities associated with fintech, the financial regulator harnesses comprehensive risk-based mechanisms to embrace exposures to cyber risks while promoting institutionalization of cybersecurity among the regulated firms with strategic controls"
2017-0014,4,this study suggests a pathway for the evolution of a profession with both technical and ethical competence for mitigating the emerging risks arising from fintech
2017-0014,5,"however, such an approach is yet to be tested with respect to efficacy for the unexplored territories of fraud exposures, resulting from swift fintech developments across borders"
2017-0014,6,"research limitations/implications: as fintech has only emerged rapidly in the recent years, it is not conclusive in this review of performance and effectiveness of the financial regulator in its strategic approach"
2017-0014,7,further studies may utilize a longitudinal method to analyze and examine the regulatory measures undertaken by financial regulators in various gfcs
2017-0014,8,originality/value: this study reveals a strategic approach adopted by an emerged gfc in embracing fintech innovation that however brings about unidentified risks and potential frauds to its financial services sector

2017-0004,0,"regulatory change and technological developments following the 2008 global financial crisis are changing the nature of financial markets, services, and institutions"
2017-0004,1,"at the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or regtechthe use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance"
2017-0004,2,regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on regtech
2017-0004,3,"whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate"
2017-0004,4,regtech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation
2017-0004,5,regtech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes
2017-0004,6,this offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators
2017-0004,7,"however, the potential of regtech is far greater  it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance"
2017-0004,8,"we argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation"
2017-0004,9,"this paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of regtech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries"

2016-0007,2,case description: this study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in taiwan
2016-0007,3,the major data sources include the meeting notes of the fintech investment task force and interviews with the team members
2016-0007,4,co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the parts strategies in co-petition theory
2016-0007,5,"the results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of fintech investment, (2) the added value from fintech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same fintech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations"
2016-0007,6,discussion and evaluation: this study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape fintechs development
2016-0007,7,"(2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not fintech ready"

2016-0005,0,"the purpose of technology is not to make finance better, but to make finance serve real life better"
2016-0005,1,fintech has grown much faster in china than in the united states
2016-0005,2,"in china, this success has come not from an initial technology advantage, but from integration between finance and real-life needs"
2016-0005,3,"this experience has important implications for understanding financial innovations, and for the development of inclusive finance"
2016-0011,0,fintech is a newly emerged service that combines innovative financial services and latest mobile technology
2016-0011,1,"since this service is new, there is a lack of study that investigates consumer behavior in adopting the service"
2016-0011,2,"founded on regulatory focus theory, our study aims to explain two different factors that motivate the adoption of fintech in china"
2016-0011,3,we plan to collect data from university students who used alipay and tenpay (two of the leading fintech companies in china)
2016-0011,4,the findings from our study will be valuable to fintech companies in strategizing and promoting usage of their services
2016-0017,0,overview: a succession of new user-oriented services combining finance and it have been appearing recently
2016-0017,1,"known as fintech, these services influence competitive advantage for their ability to create innovation beyond the framework of conventional financial services"

2016-0008,0,we investigate the effects of entry of financial technology (fintech) based firms on competition in the retail payments market
2016-0008,1,"with a model of two-sided market with vertical restraints, we derive the following results"
2016-0008,2,"when only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants opt for multi-homing or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement"
2016-0008,3,"on the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is allowed, a partial multi-homing equilibrium could emerge under certain conditions, in which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur"
2016-0008,4,"without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant in general"
2016-0008,5,this suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market
2016-0001,0,"the rapid development of information and communications technology is transforming the entire industry landscape, heralding a new era of convergence services"
2016-0001,1,"as one of the developing countries in the financial sector, china is experiencing an unprecedented level of convergence between finance and technology"

2016-0002,0,this paper examined the acceptance of payment-type fintech services of users by utilizing the elaboration likelihood model by petty and cacioppo [1] and by applying variables associated with the technology acceptance model
2016-0002,1,"in addition, it analyzed the causal relationship between concern for information privacy and self-efficacy by adopting them as moderating variables"
2016-0002,2,"results suggested that usefulness, ease of use and credibility had an effect on intention to use, and self-efficacy was found to have an moderating effect on independent and dependent variables"
2016-0002,3,"further, concern for information privacy was found to be a factor obstructing the path to intention to use"
2016-0002,4,"the implications of this study are that in the promotion of payment-type fintech services, convenience and usefulness are the most critical and influential variables in terms of usage, while government deregulation and stronger security are called for from an institutional aspect"

2016-0000,0,there is currently no consensus about what the term fintech means
2016-0000,1,"this paper explores the complexity of fintech, and attempts a definition, drawn from a process of reviewing more than 200 scholarly articles referencing the term fintech and covering a period of more than 40 years"
2016-0000,2,"the objective of this study is to offer a definition which is distinct as well as succinct in its communication, yet sufficiently broad in its range of application"
2016-0000,3,"as the origins of the term can neither be unequivocally placed in academia nor in practice, the definition concentrates on extracting out the quintessence of fintech using both spheres"
2016-0000,4,"applying semantic analysis and building on the commonalities of 13 peerreviewed definitions of the term, it is concluded that fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities"
2016-0000,5,the implications as well as the shortcomings of this definition are discussed
2016-0015,0,"after the recent cyber-attacks on financial institutions around the world, we are faced with a whole new set of challenges never seen before"
2016-0015,1,"traditionally, fraud and theft were conducted in person or through traditional telecommunications such as telephone"
