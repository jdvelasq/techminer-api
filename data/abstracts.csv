2022-0003,1,"in this research, banking financial data were collected from three kuwaiti banks"
2022-0003,2,"the data included usage information in all electronic banking channels for each customer, their characteristics and financial portfolio"
2022-0003,3,"the aim of this study is to predict the customer use of electronic channels, treated as dependent variables, considering individual customer information, which is treated as independent variables"
2022-0003,4,"to bring the most benefit to bankers and financial analysts, machine learning techniques (ml), specifically multinomial logistic regression, were used to deal with the data from cleaning to analysing"
2022-0003,5,the results disclosed that banks can determine the preferred electronic banking channel for each of their customers by knowing some information about their characteristics and financial product portfolio
2022-0004,0,"in the current era of deepening financial openness, with the development of big data in computer finance, the vigorous development of fintech has brought technology spillover effect and competition effect to the risks of banks"
2022-0004,1,"computer big data has a wide range of applications in all aspects in order to analyze the comprehensive impact of financial technology and financial openness on the risks of commercial banks, this paper adopts the data of 126 commercial banks in china from 2011 to 2018 to conduct empirical analysis by using systematic gmm method, double-fixed effect model and mediating effect model"
2022-0004,2,"the results show that, in general, financial technology has a negative impact on the risks of commercial banks, that is, the technology spillover effect and competitive effect brought by financial technology to commercial banks are greater than, and the positive impact is greater than the negative impact"
2022-0004,3,opening up the financial sector would make banks more risky
2022-0004,4,fintech has a masking effect
2022-0004,5,"although the opening of the financial industry will increase the risk taking of banks, the opening of the financial industry will promote the development of fintech, which in turn will reduce the risk taking of banks"
2022-0004,6,"therefore, the financial industry needs to pay attention to the risks of banks in the process of opening up"
2022-0004,7,banks can increase investment in the research and development of blockchain and artificial intelligence technology and improve the development level of financial technology
2022-0005,0,"with the rapid development of information technology, internet finance is increasingly prosperous"
2022-0005,1,"while financial technology has brought new directions to china's finance, it is also accompanied by regulatory problems"
2022-0005,2,traditional financial supervision concepts and models need to be reformed urgently
2022-0005,3,"in terms of supervision methods, it is also necessary to upgrade supervision technology accordingly, establish a big data supervision platform, give full play to the role of third-party credit service agencies on this basis, improve the technical knowledge of supervisors, and strengthen the work of network security to fill the regulatory loopholes"
2022-0006,0,the digitisation process is affecting all markets and raising consumer awareness about companies sustainable behaviour
2022-0006,1,this work studies the effect of the sustainability profile of fintech companies on the firm (market value and book value) as the factors that add value to investors and motivate their evolution in markets are still unknown
2022-0006,2,"using the kbw and nasdaq fintech indices, and the nasdaq insurance index (ixis), we composed a panel of 95 companies over a 10-year period (20102019) with economic-financial variables and data about green certificates and sustainability indices"
2022-0006,3,the applied methodology is based on dynamic (gmm-sys) and static (pcse) panel data models
2022-0006,4,"our results show that the market value of fintech companies is positively driven by an csr report being issued, the position in the csr reptrak, company size and board size"
2022-0006,5,"in contrast, the number of green certificates, particularly their position in the green ranking, is negatively related to their market value"
2022-0006,6,"surprisingly in the most transparent companies, the direction of the variables effect evidenced for the book value per share is the opposite to market capitalisation"
2022-0007,0,"in the recent years, the concerns raised by environmentalists, over the excessive usage of electricity, particularly in the mining of cryptocurrencies, have caught the attention of the community at large"
2022-0007,1,"in this regard, regulators and stakeholders have been reevaluating the costs and benefits of technological development in general, as well as in fintech, specifically targeting their efforts towards the restoration of the environment"
2022-0007,2,"considering that technology has long been perceived as dual edged sword for the environment, this would be the appropriate time to assess its true role in the environmental improvement, or rather, even deterioration"
2022-0007,3,"therefore, this study attempts to address the question of whether the fintech development is helping economies towards a smooth transition towards a lower level of carbon and greenhouse gasses emissions"
2022-0007,4,"our results in this aspect are highly encouraging, and confirm that fintech development can in fact help to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, after the inclusion of appropriate control variables"
2022-0007,5,"moreover, these results are robust even after the incorporation of the potential endogeneity of fintech development, by the usage of 2sls and gmm estimations"
2022-0008,0,"technological advances seem to have no limit so that its power can penetrate many sectors, one of them is business"
2022-0008,1,"on the one hand, the development of financial technology has proven to be of benefit to consumers, business actors and the world economy, but on the other hand it has potential risks that if it does not adequately follow technological developments it could disrupt the financial system"
2022-0008,2,"cooperatives are understood as legal entities that are established based on the principle of kinship and also adheres to the principles of social economy with the aim to improve their members in carrying out dominant transactions using cash, then modelled for the future will rely on cashless and fintech virtual accounts"

2022-0009,1,"more and more science and technology are applied to the financial field, which greatly promotes a new round of prosperity and development of chinas financial market"
2022-0009,2,"however, because big data has the characteristics of fast spreading speed, wide penetration area, strong concealment, and difficulty in supervision, the integration of technology and finance in the era of big data will also generate some new risk problems"
2022-0009,3,"based on this, this article starts with the connotation and characteristics of financial technology, summarizes the risk performance of financial technology, and proposes corresponding countermeasures, aiming to promote the healthy and stable development of chinas financial technology"
2022-0000,0,technology firms are increasingly moving to finance
2022-0000,1,they are able to make use of a large stock of user data and offer a range of services that otherwise were not possible
2022-0000,2,this move may pose fresh challenges to financial stability
2022-0000,3,this paper empirically evaluates the tail risk and systemic risk of technology firms
2022-0000,4,"our data sample consists of technology firms, and for comparison we also evaluate the tail risk and systemic risk of finance firms"
2022-0000,5,we use daily equity returns data from 2 april 1992 to 31 december 2019 and we adopt the univariate extreme value theory (evt) to determine equity tail risk
2022-0000,6,our selection criteria is the market capitalisation and we choose the top twenty technology and the top twenty finance firms to evaluate tail risk and systemic risk
2022-0000,7,"we found that the tail risk of technology firms is higher than the financial firms, whereas they are less likely to be in distress conditional upon a shock from the system"
2022-0000,8,"however, this finding for technology firms reverses when we use recent data via our six-year rolling estimates"
2022-0000,9,"we conclude that, similar to finance firms, there should be tighter regulations for technology firms since technology firms are riskier than the finance firms"
2022-0000,10,our paper has significant implications for both national and global financial regulators
2022-0010,0,the time-to-success of reward crowdfunding campaigns constitutes a relevant topic that has been neglected in business literature
2022-0010,1,"in this study, we employ parametric and semi-parametric models of survival analysis to identify the determining factors of the duration of success of these campaigns"
2022-0010,2,"based on more than 4200 reward crowdfunding campaigns, our results are robust for controls and reveal that the campaigns that attain success most rapidly are located predominantly in cities with greater income inequality"
2022-0010,3,these are cities that are characterized by lower fundraising targets and receive a larger number of pledges
2022-0010,4,"in addition, our covariates indicate a non-constant influence on time-to-success during the fundraising period"

2022-0011,1,artificial intelligence (ai) technology has been integrated into investing activities to create automated investment management services known as robo-advisors
2022-0011,2,"despite the fact that numerous efforts have been attempted to publicize robo-advisors, its adoption among malaysian retail investors remains relatively low"
2022-0011,3,"hence, the aim of this paper is to extend the existing technology acceptance model (tam) to examine the main drivers of intention to adopt robo-advisors that explain the robo-advisors adoption process among malaysian retail investors"
2022-0011,4,"in this study, 300 valid primary responses from malaysian retail investors aged 18 to 77 who have used robo-advisors were collected through online questionnaire and analyzed using partial least square structural equation modelling (pls-sem) method"
2022-0011,5,all the hypotheses in this study were supported
2022-0011,6,"in particular, attitude was found to be the strongest predictor of behavioral intention to adopt robo-advisors followed by perceived usefulness, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and lastly perceived risk"
2022-0011,7,"as such, robo-advisory vendors and the relevant regulatory authorities should focus on these key drivers to boost robo-advisors adoption in malaysia"
2022-0012,0,one of the main purposes of financial technology solutions is to reduce the infrastructure costs of financial institutions
2022-0012,1,"adopting the use of fintech technologies implies, in addition to a reduction in costs derived from physical entities, an improvement in user satisfaction, greater flexibility in terms of data access on different devices and more transparency in financial management"

2021-0171,1,this fact led to the creation of two committees of enquiry in the german bundestag and the european parliament to try to improve the public mechanisms for supervising large digital financial corporations
2021-0171,2,"the role played by bafin, the german supervisory authority, and wirecard's fierce defence in an exercise of collective economic nationalism, have been widely questioned in the face of reports published in a british media"
2021-0171,3,"the reports commissioned by the european parliament to various groups of experts, and the academic articles that have been published as a result of the wirecard case, allow us to reflect on the correct protection of whistleblowers in the midst of the process of national transpositions of european directive 2019/1937, as well as to defend the proposal that more ambition is needed to encourage this type of actions, in a horizon of growing business complexity, and the rise of a digital economy model that is not always well regulated, opaque and refractory to accountability"
2021-0172,0,this paper conducted a comprehensive analysis based on bibliometrics and science mapping analysis

2021-0174,1,we employ a novel approach to choose the optimal combination for the power law exponent and the minimum value for the volatilities bending the power law
2021-0174,2,our results indicate that bitcoin volatility is well-behaved in a statistical sense with a finite theoretical variance
2021-0174,3,"surprisingly, the volatilities of stablecoins are statistically unstable and contemporaneously respond to bitcoin volatility"
2021-0174,4,"also, whereas the volatilities of stablecoins are not granger-causal for bitcoin volatility, lagged bitcoin volatility exhibits granger-causal effects on the volatilities of stablecoins"
2021-0174,5,we conclude that bitcoin volatility is a fundamental factor that drives the volatilities of stablecoins

2021-0179,3,the results obtained using partial least squares (pls) path modelling indicate that perceived usefulness and privacy are the most decisive factors with a one percent higher perceived usefulness (higher privacy) increasing usage intentions by 0.57 % (0.25 %)
2021-0179,4,the results are robust to various socio-demographic and fintech-related controls as well as alternative estimation procedures such as generalized structured component analysis (gsca)
2021-0180,0,"using comprehensive credit bureau data, we document that consumers who borrow from marketplace lending (mpl) platforms have lower credit scores and higher default rates in the long run relative to observably similar applicants for bank loans"
2021-0180,1,"the long-run credit scores and default rates of mpl borrowers are especially worse when the mpl platforms provide less information to mpl investors, when mpl borrowers are benchmarked against relationship bank borrowers, and for one-time mpl borrowers as compared to repeat mpl borrowers"
2021-0180,2,"overall, our results suggest that mpl lenders face greater information asymmetries with respect to their borrowers than traditional banks"
2021-0181,0,this paper presents an analytical framework that describes the business model of banks
2021-0181,1,it draws on the classical theory of banking and the literature on digital transformation
2021-0181,2,"it provides an explanation for existing trends and, by extending the theory of the banking firm, it illustrates how financial intermediation will be impacted by innovative financial technology applications"
2021-0181,3,it further reviews the options that established banks will have to consider in order to mitigate the threat to their profitability
2021-0181,4,deposit taking and lending are considered in the context of the challenge made from shadow banking and the all-digital banks
2021-0181,5,"the paper contributes to an understanding of the future of banking, providing a framework for scholarly empirical investigation"
2021-0181,6,"in the discussion, four possible strategies are proposed for market participants, (1) customer retention, (2) customer acquisition, (3) banking as a service and (4) social media payment platforms"
2021-0181,7,"it is concluded that, in an increasingly digital world, trust will remain at the core of banking"
2021-0181,8,"that said, liquidity transformation will still have an important role to play"
2021-0181,9,"the nature of banking and financial services, however, will change dramatically"
2021-0182,0,"in recent years, biometric technologies have been widely embedded in mobile devices"
2021-0182,1,these technologies were originally employed to enhance the security of mobile devices
2021-0182,2,"with the rise of financial technology (fintech), which uses mobile devices and applications as promotional platforms, biometrics has the important role of strengthening the identification of such applications for security"
2021-0182,3,"however, users still have privacy and trust concerns about biometrics"
2021-0182,4,previous studies have demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (tam) can rigorously explain and predict user acceptance of new technologies
2021-0182,5,this study therefore modifies the tam as a basic research architecture
2021-0182,6,"based on a literature review, we add two new variables, namely, perceived privacy and perceived trust, to extend the traditional tam to examine user acceptance of biometric identification in fintech applications"
2021-0182,7,"first, we apply the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to evaluate the defined objects and relevant criteria of the research framework"
2021-0182,8,"second, we use the ahp results in the scenario analysis to explore biometric identification methods that correspond to objects and criteria"
2021-0182,9,the results indicate that face and voice recognition are the two most preferred identification methods in fintech applications
2021-0182,10,"in addition, there are significant changes in the results of the perceived trust and perceived privacy dominant scenarios"
2021-0037,0,"this study examines the spillover effect between financial technology (fintech) stocks and other financial assets (gold, bitcoin, a global equity index, crude oil, and the us dollar) during the covid-19 crisis"
2021-0037,1,"employing daily data from june 2019 to august 2020, our empirical analysis shows that the outbreak of covid-19 exacerbated volatility transmission across asset classes, while subsequent decreases in new confirmed cases globally reduced the intensity of these spillovers"
2021-0037,2,"the evidence for the usd and gold supports their safe haven properties during catastrophic events, while innovative technology products as represented by a financial technology index (kftx) and bitcoin were highly susceptible to external shocks"
2021-0037,3,"these results show that when push comes to shove, the buck stops with the usd and gold and that the exorbitant privilege enjoyed by the usd prevailed during the covid-19 pandemic"
2021-0054,0,"inclusive finance is a core concept of finance that makes various financial products and services accessible and affordable to all individuals and businesses, especially those excluded from the formal financial system"
2021-0054,1,one of the leading forces affecting people's ability to access financial services in rural areas is financial literacy
2021-0054,2,"this study investigated the impacts of financial knowledge on financial access through banking, microfinance, and fintech access using the bangladesh rural population data"
2021-0054,3,"we employed three econometrics models: logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary loglog regression to examine whether financial literacy significantly affects removing the barriers that prevent people from participating and using financial services to improve their lives"
2021-0054,4,the empirical findings showed that knowledge regarding various financial services factors had significant impacts on getting financial access
2021-0054,5,"some variables such as profession, income level, knowledge regarding depositing and withdrawing money, and knowledge regarding interest rate highly affected the overall access to finance"
2021-0054,6,the study's results provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve financial inclusion in the developing country context
2021-0054,7,"a comprehensive and long-term education program should be delivered broadly to the rural population to make a big stride in financial inclusion, a key driver of poverty reduction and prosperity boosting"
2021-0001,0,"financial technology (fintech) makes a significant contribution to the financial system by reducing costs, providing higher quality services and increasing customer satisfaction"
2021-0001,1,"hence, new studies play an essential role to improve fintech investments"
2021-0001,2,this study evaluates fintech-based investments of european banking services with an application of an original methodology that considers interval type-2 (it2) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and it2 fuzzy topsis models
2021-0001,3,empirical findings are controlled for consistency by applying the vikor method
2021-0001,4,"moreover, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by considering six distinct cases"
2021-0001,5,this study contributes to the existing literature by identifying the most important fintech-based investment alternatives to improve the financial performance of european banks
2021-0001,6,"our empirical findings illustrate that results are coherent, reliable, and identify competitive advantage as the most important factor among fintech-based determinants"
2021-0001,7,"moreover, payment and money transferring systems are the most important fintech-based investment alternatives"
2021-0001,8,"it is recommended that, among fintech-based investments, european banks should mainly focus on payment and money transferring alternatives to attract the attention of customers and satisfy their expectations"
2021-0001,9,this is also believed to have a positive impact on the ease of bank receivable collection
2021-0001,10,another important point is that fintech-based investments in money transferring systems could help to decrease costs
2021-0137,0,this study aims to evaluate the crowdfunding alternatives regarding new service development process pathways of clean energy investment projects
2021-0137,1,"in this framework, a new model has been generated by considering the consensus-based group decision-making with incomplete preferences, pythagorean fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis)"
2021-0137,2,"moreover, a comparative evaluation has been performed with vise kriterijumska optimizacija i"
2021-0137,3,kompromisno resenje methodology and sensitivity analysis has been made by considering 4 different cases
2021-0137,4,the main contribution is to identify appropriate crowdfunding-based funding alternatives for the improvement of the clean energy investments with a novel mcdm model
2021-0137,5,"by considering the iteration technique and consensus-based analysis, the missing parts in the evaluations can be completed and opposite opinion problems can be reduced"
2021-0137,6,"furthermore, with the help of hybrid mcdm model by combining dematel and topsis, more objective results can be reached"
2021-0137,7,it is concluded that the analysis results are coherent and reliable
2021-0137,8,the findings indicate that the full launch is the most significant criterion for equity and debt-based crowdfunding alternatives
2021-0137,9,"on the other side, the analysis has the highest weight for reward and donation-based alternatives whereas design is the most essential item regarding the royalty-based alternative"
2021-0137,10,"additionally, it is also defined that equity-based crowdfunding alternative is the most significant for the service development process of clean energy investment projects"
2021-0137,11,"in this way, it will be possible to provide a continuous resource for clean energy investment projects"
2021-0137,12,"on the other hand, by providing financing with equity, there will be no fixed financing cost for clean energy investors"
2021-0137,13,"if these investors make a profit, they distribute dividends with the decision of their authorized bodies"

2021-0183,1,"financial markets faced an unprecedented rapid decline and recovery on may 6, 2010, known as the may 6 flash crash"
2021-0183,2,roughly one trillion $ market value in less than thirty minutes vanished with the biggest one-day point decline in the history of the djia at the time
2021-0183,3,"since the market events took place in electronic markets, and algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading, parts of fintech, played significant roles, we handle the may 6 flash crash from the fintech, suptech, and financial supervision perspectives"
2021-0183,4,"with the flashback method, we analyzed the reactions of market participants, media, and two financial supervisors, the sec, and the cftc, to the market crash"
2021-0183,5,"we find that the technological imbalance between financial markets or institutions and their supervisors drove the markets in uncertainty, hence in a fear and panic environment"
2021-0183,6,"since the imbalance has not diminished yet, the same risks still exist"
2021-0183,7,"as a remedy, we introduce a new concept and model with a well-functioning suptech system to cope with the may 6 type fintech crises"
2021-0021,0,"rural microfinance must contend with the triple challenges of isolation, small-scale transactions, and risk"
2021-0021,1,these challenges result in information asymmetries and transaction costs that render markets for financial services costly or missing
2021-0021,2,"this paper examines how emerging digital technologies (e.g., mobile money, digital credit scoring, and earth observation) can reshape rural markets for savings, credit, and insurance services, especially in developing countries"
2021-0021,3,"although our synthesis of the literature suggests reason for hope in all three domains, the imperfections of these digital technologies require evaluation and oversight if the resulting rural financial system is to be more efficient and equitable than its predecessor"

2021-0020,0,"based on daily data of 749 active online p2p lending platforms in chinese market, this study explores the key factors affecting the net cash inflow rate of the platform which is vital for its operation and survival from the perspective of reputation, structure design and fintech ecosystem"
2021-0020,1,internal governance issues of p2p lending platforms are further discussed according to the model results
2021-0020,2,a positive u-shaped relationship has been found between the platform duration and its net cash inflow rate which proves the role of reputation in the long-term development of p2p lending platforms
2021-0020,3,"in addition, we demonstrate that both capital and operational structure design of the platform (e.g"
2021-0020,4,"shareholders background, credit assignment, trusteeship and guarantee) have a significant impact on the platforms net cash inflow rate"
2021-0020,5,the cash flow level of the platform has also been affected by the regional fintech ecosystem
2021-0020,6,"platforms in a medium-developing ecosystem may have the highest net cash inflow rate, while a backward ecosystem will lower the cash flows of the platforms located in this area on average"
2021-0020,7,some suggestions on cash flow management and internal governance of p2p lending platforms for both platform founders and governments are put forward in the end of the study
2021-0184,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to gauge the awareness and perception of indian individual investors about a new fintech innovation known as robo-advisors in the wealth management scenario
2021-0184,1,"robo-advisors are comprehensive automated online advisory platforms that help investors in managing wealth by recommending portfolio allocations, which are based on certain algorithms"
2021-0184,2,design/methodology/approach: this is a phenomenological qualitative study that used five focussed group discussions to gather the stipulated information
2021-0184,3,purposive sampling was used and the sample comprised investors who actively invest in the indian stock market
2021-0184,4,a semi-structured questionnaire and homogeneous discussions were used for this study
2021-0184,5,discussion time for all the groups was 203 min
2021-0184,6,one of the authors moderated the discussions and translated the audio recordings verbatim
2021-0184,7,"subsequently, content analysis was carried out by using the nvivo 12 software (qsr international) to derive different themes"
2021-0184,8,"findings: factors such as cost-effectiveness, trust, data security, behavioural biases and sentiments of the investors were observed as crucial points which significantly impacted the perception of the investors"
2021-0184,9,"furthermore, several suggestions on different ways to enhance the awareness levels of investors were brought up by the participants during the discussions"
2021-0184,10,it was observed that some investors perceive robo-advisors as only an alternative for fund/wealth managers/brokers for quantitative analysis
2021-0184,11,"also, they strongly believe that human intervention is necessary to gauge the emotions of the investors"
2021-0184,12,"hence, at present, robo-advisors for the indian stock market, act only as a supplementary service rather than a substitute for financial advisors"
2021-0184,13,"research limitations/implications: due to the explorative nature of the study and limited participants, the findings of the study cannot be generalised to the overall population"
2021-0184,14,future research is imperative to study the dynamic nature of artificial intelligence (ai) theories and investigate whether they are able to capture the sentiments of individual investors and human sentiments impacting the market
2021-0184,15,"practical implications: this study gives an insight into the awareness, perception and opinion of the investors about robo-advisory services"
2021-0184,16,"from a managerial perspective, the findings suggest that additional attention needs to be devoted to the adoption and inculcation of ai and machine learning theories while building algorithms or logic to come up with effective models"
2021-0184,17,many investors expressed discontent with the current design of risk profiles of the investors
2021-0184,18,this helps to provide feedback for developers and designers of robo-advisors to include advanced and detailed programming to be able to do risk profiling in a more comprehensive and precise manner
2021-0184,19,"social implications: in the future, robo-advisors will change the wealth management scenario"
2021-0184,20,it is well-established that data is the new oil for all businesses in the present times
2021-0184,21,"technologies such as robo-advisor, need to evolve further in terms of predicting unstructured data, improvising qualitative analysis techniques to include the ability to gauge emotions of investors and markets in real-time"
2021-0184,22,"additionally, the behavioural biases of both the programmers and the investors need to be taken care of simultaneously while designing these automated decision support systems"
2021-0184,23,"originality/value: this study fulfils an identified gap in the literature regarding the investors perception of new fintech innovation, that is, robo-advisors"
2021-0184,24,it also clarifies the confusion about the awareness level of robo-advisors amongst indian individual investors by examining their attitudes and by suggesting innovations for future research
2021-0184,25,"to the best of the authors knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the awareness, perception and attitudes of individual investors towards robo-advisors"
2021-0185,0,"abstract: the changes in the world economy since the early 1990s, such as the globalization of financial and commodity markets, deregulation of the financial sector, and its growing role in the economy, have led to significant changes in the real estate market, traditionally one of the most conservative markets"
2021-0185,1,the process of financial institutions entering the top players in the real estate market is most commonly referred to in various researches as financialization
2021-0185,2,"in the last decade, this trend has been supplemented by processes associated with disruptive technologies that have emerged within the rapidly developing fintech industry and offer a number of mechanisms that make investing in real estate (crowdfunding), using real estate (sharing), and turnover of digital choses in action secured by real estate assets (tokenization) significantly more democratic"
2021-0185,3,"as a result, the excess of the total capitalization of the financial component of the market (including the growing digital share) over the total value of real estate assets can exceed reasonable limits and become an independent cause of another crisis similar to the 20062008 crisis in the united states"
2021-0186,0,the contemporary innovations in financial technology (fintech) serve society with an environmentally friendly atmosphere
2021-0186,1,fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services
2021-0186,2,"therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic"
2021-0186,3,"this is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being"
2021-0186,4,we have used the bibliometrix 3.0 package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically
2021-0186,5,the study suggests that acm international conference proceedings is the core source of published fintech literature
2021-0186,6,china leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications
2021-0186,7,bina nusantara university is the most relevant affiliation
2021-0186,8,arner and buckley provide impactful fintech literature
2021-0186,9,"in the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes"
2021-0186,10,these research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech
2021-0186,11,the study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams
2021-0186,12,"these research streams are related to cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology, financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech), and machine learning and deep learning innovations"
2021-0186,13,"the study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density"
2021-0186,14,"these various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics"
2021-0187,0,payment systems around the world are evolving with the emergence of digital money issued by private firms and central banks
2021-0187,1,we provide a conceptual framework to compare and contrast traditional forms of money with their new digital equivalents
2021-0187,2,"we suggest that some forms of digital money, while less stable as a store of value, could be rapidly adopted given their advantages as a means of payment"
2021-0187,3,we review the benefits and risks that would emerge
2021-0187,4,one approach to managing risks would be to require full backing of selected digital money with central bank reserves
2021-0187,5,"we call the arrangement synthetic central bank digital currency (scbdc), a private-public partnership that combines the advantages of private sector innovation and customer orientation with the safety and stability of central bank-backed money"
2021-0187,6,"we offer policy considerations, directions for research, and an overview of the literature to date"
2021-0187,7,the analysis of digital currencies is an exciting new field crossing into monetary and financial economics that will reshape the monetary and financial systems for many years to come
2021-0188,0,"financial inclusion has gone beyond the rhetoric surrounding social development and financial stability, but also expanding into pathos of arbitrage benefits made from cheap retail deposits by large banks and banks from technologically developed regions"
2021-0188,1,this study investigates whether a higher degree of fintech-based financial inclusion (ffi) intensifies banks risk-taking by analysing data from 534 banks from 24 oic countries
2021-0188,2,the results indicate that higher degree of ffi controls bank's risk-taking behaviour
2021-0188,3,the nexus turns stronger in the post-industrial revolution 4.0 (ir4.0) era
2021-0188,4,our results are robust across multiple proxies and estimation methods
2021-0188,5,we discuss how competition surrounding investing in fintech may expose the banks towards severe uncertainty
2021-0189,0,it is widely claimed that financial technology democratizes financial access and promotes financial inclusion
2021-0189,1,this paper challenges this dominant narrative of financial technology using the popular us-based mobile investing platform robinhood as a case study
2021-0189,2,"analyzing press articles on robinhood and regulatory filings of online brokerages, the concepts of financial infrastructures and platforms are used to unpack the capitalist logics that drive the platform business model"
2021-0189,3,"specifically, this paper shows how digital interface design plays a central role in robinhood's articulation of investors into the stock markets, through its simple, minimalist app that keeps users engaged by the productive management of frictions"
2021-0189,4,the ease of investing via platform-based brokerages has seen investors taking on greater amounts of risk
2021-0189,5,this paper argues that robinhood's success is driven by the continued expansion of its user base using various interface design techniques
2021-0189,6,"this allows platform capitalism to be enacted by extracting rent through various revenue streams, where higher rents are derived from more frequent and riskier trading behaviors"
2021-0189,7,the narrative of democratizing finance as employed widely in the financial technology sector thus obscures the capitalist logics and predatory practices that underlie financial technology
2021-0190,0,vast evidence exists of discrimination in lending against african americans
2021-0190,1,"does such widespread discrimination persist in peer-to-peer lending, in the absence of information about borrowers ethnicity? to investigate this question, we gather data from a large peer-to-peer lender that uses algorithms and no face-to-face interviews to determine loan approval and conditions"
2021-0190,2,"with data from 3.6 million loan applications and 817,000 granted loans during 2016 and 2017, we perform regressions of loan acceptance and loan conditions on the percentage of african american residents by 3-digit zip area"
2021-0190,3,the evidence shows the persistence of discrimination in peer-to-peer lending against african american borrowers
2021-0190,4,"in areas with higher proportions of african american residents, the results reveal higher loan rejection, higher loan spread, and shorter loan maturity"
2021-0190,5,discrimination in peer-to-peer lending also affects native american and asian borrowers
2021-0190,6,"thus, the expansion of peer-to-peer lending cannot end discrimination in lending"
2021-0191,0,"supply chain finance (scf) is a set of financing processes and technology-based business that links supply chain members, in which innovative financial products and technologies, i.e., asset-backed securitization (abs) and blockchain, have been widely adopted"
2021-0191,1,we use a game-theoretic approach to study the operations strategy for scf with abs
2021-0191,2,"more precisely, we explore the issue of centralization, that is, whether a retailer, as a core company in a decentralized supply chain system, should establish her own originated channel, and the impacts of the blockchain adoption on supply chain systems"
2021-0191,3,we find that the core company should not establish her own originated channel when her main business is to sell high-cost products or when the marginal cost of blockchain implementation is sufficiently large
2021-0191,4,"besides, when the core company builds her own originated channel, the manufacturer should decrease the wholesale price, but the core company should increase the retail price under certain conditions"
2021-0191,5,"interestingly, both the service rate and interest rate in the financing channel remain unchanged"
2021-0191,6,"in addition, we find that the impacts of the blockchain technology on the wholesale price, retail price, and discount of the fund depend on the production cost"
2021-0191,7,"however, both the service rate and interest rate always decline when the blockchain technology is introduced, because the market becomes more creditable"
2021-0191,8,"moreover, in both decentralized and centralized systems, all supply chain members profits are increased if the marginal cost of the blockchain technology is sufficiently low"
2021-0192,0,financial technology (fintech) is currently rising due to its essential impact on the economy
2021-0192,1,the availability of fintech provides an easier way for consumers to access various financial products through digitalised platforms
2021-0192,2,"unfortunately, the rate of fintech adoption in the market is still scant due to various risks and the market perception towards its products"
2021-0192,3,this article aims to develop a systematic literature review on the fintech product adoptions during the last decades
2021-0192,4,the article provides a review of various theoretical frameworks used by previous research
2021-0192,5,"as a result, this study outlines the factors that enhance fintech adoption from the adopters (consumers) and innovators (firms) standpoint"
2021-0192,6,the article also offers a new theoretical framework to enhance market adoption by highlighting firms internal and external focus together with consumers internal and external factors
2021-0192,7,this study highlights the importance of communications between firms and consumers in order for the firms to match their focus with consumers factors to enhance the fintech adoption
2021-0193,0,developing country lenders are taking advantage of fintech tools to create fully digital loans on mobile phones
2021-0193,1,"using administrative and survey data, we study the take up and impacts of one of the most popular digital loan products in the world, m-shwari in kenya"
2021-0193,2,"while 34% of those eligible for a loan take it, the loan does not substitute for other credit"
2021-0193,3,the loans improve household resilience: households are 6.3 percentage points less likely to forego expenses due to negative shocks
2021-0193,4,fintech tools can be a crucial way to improve financial access and household resilience
2021-0194,0,"fintech, which stands for financial technology, is growing fast globally since the economic crisis hit the united states in 2008"
2021-0194,1,fintech companies are striving to secure a competitive advantage over existing financial services by providing efficient financial services utilizing the latest technologies
2021-0194,2,fintech companies can be classified into several areas according to their business solutions
2021-0194,3,"among the fintech sector, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending companies are leading the domestic fintech industry"
2021-0194,4,p2p lending is a method of lending funds directly to individuals or businesses without an official financial institution participating as an intermediary in the transaction
2021-0194,5,the rapid growth of p2p lending companies has now reached a level that threatens secondary financial markets
2021-0194,6,"however, as the growth rate increases, so does the potential risk factor"
2021-0194,7,"in addition to government laws to protect and regulate p2p lending, further measures to reduce the risk of p2p lending accidents have yet to keep up with the pace of market growth"
2021-0194,8,"since most p2p lenders do not implement their own credit rating system, they rely on personal credit scores provided by credit rating agencies such as the nice credit information service in korea"
2021-0194,9,"however, it is hard for p2p lending companies to figure out the intentional loan default of the borrower since most borrowers credit scores are not excellent"
2021-0194,10,this study analyzed the voices of telephone conversation between the loan consultant and the borrower in order to verify if it is applicable to determine the personal credit score
2021-0194,11,"experimental results show that the change in pitch frequency and change in voice pitch frequency can be reliably identified, and this difference can be used to predict the loan defaults or use it to determine the underlying default risk"

2021-0195,0,"following the emergence of cryptocurrencies, the field of digital assets experienced a sudden explosion of interest among institutional investors"
2021-0195,1,"however, regarding icos, there were a lot of scams involving the disappearance of firms after they had collected significant amounts of funds"
2021-0195,2,"we study how well one can predict if an offering will turn out to be a scam, doing so based on the characteristics known ex-ante"
2021-0195,3,"we therefore examine which of these characteristics are the most important predictors of a scam, and how they influence the probability of a scam"
2021-0195,4,we use detailed data with 160 features from about 300 icos that took place before march 2018 and succeeded in raising most of their required capital
2021-0195,5,various machine learning algorithms are applied together with novel xai tools in order to identify the most important predictors of an offerings failure and understand the shape of relationships
2021-0195,6,"it turns out that based on the features known ex-ante, one can predict a scam with an accuracy of about 6570%, and that nonlinear machine learning models perform better than traditional logistic regression and its regularized extensions"
2021-0196,0,"purpose: recently, the concept of financial technology (fintech) has attracted extensive attention from international organisations and regulators, in particular, how to achieve a winwin situation between financial institutions' fintech innovation and effective regulation has become a hot topic"
2021-0196,1,this study purposes to explore the evolutionary game relationship between fintech innovation and regulation by constructing both static and dynamic earmarking game models
2021-0196,2,design/methodology/approach: a simulation experiment was conducted using primary data obtained from a commercial bank in china
2021-0196,3,"findings: the results of the theoretical analysis of evolutionary game models were consistent with the corresponding simulation results, proving the validity of the proposed evolutionary game models"
2021-0196,4,it was also found that the dynamic earmarking game model was more stable and effective than the static earmarking game model in promoting fintech innovation and regulation
2021-0196,5,"furthermore, when the regulators utilised a dynamic earmarking mechanism, the evolutionary path of financial institutions and regulators' behaviour strategies took the shape of a spiral and eventually converged to a central point, indicating the existence of an evolutionary stable strategy and nash equilibrium"
2021-0196,6,"finally, because the behaviour strategies of financial institutions were mainly influenced by the regulators' policies, the regulators were inspired to adjust the corresponding regulation policies on fintech innovation"
2021-0196,7,"originality/value: this study bridges the knowledge gap in the existing literature on financial innovation and regulation, in particular by establishing evolutionary game models from the perspective of financial earmarking policies"
2021-0196,8,"also, the case study for simulation experiments can gain a more intuitive insight into fintech innovation and financial earmarking policies"
2021-0197,0,fintech has been in the focus of discussion for quite some time
2021-0197,1,"however, the market share of fintech companies is still relatively small compared to that of more traditional financial services"
2021-0197,2,"the purpose of this paper is to analyse the status quo, current developments, and challenges ahead for the latvian fintech sector"
2021-0197,3,"we combine three analyses: a political and legal, economic, social, and technological environment (pest) analysis"
2021-0197,4,a survey among fintech companies
2021-0197,5,and an analysis of the size and financial performance of fintech companies during the last 10 years
2021-0197,6,"we find that the current status of regulation is one of the main obstacles to fintech development, because it does not sufficiently consider fintech-specific aspects"
2021-0197,7,problems in attracting a skilled workforce and an environment that is not very supportive of new developments in finance are further challenges and might explain at least part of the growth and financial performance difficulties
2021-0197,8,"a revision, modernization, and harmonization of regulation is essential to create a level playing field for all market participants: fintech companies, traditional financial service providers, and those originally traditional players that are integrating fintech solutions in their business model"
2021-0197,9,further efforts are also required to foster latvias attractiveness for a skilled workforce
2021-0197,10,we hope that this study helps increase the visibility of latvian fintech and contributes to the development of the new latvian fintech strategy
2021-0198,0,"in this paper, we conduct a fast calibration in the jump-diffusion model to capture the bitcoin price dynamics, as well as the behavior of some components affecting the price itself, such as the risk of pitfalls and its ambiguous effect on the evolution of bitcoins price"
2021-0198,1,"in addition, in our study of the bitcoin option pricing, we find that the inclusion of jumps in returns and volatilities are significant in the historical time series of bitcoin prices"
2021-0198,2,"the benefits of incorporating these jumps flow over into option pricing, as well as adequately capture the volatility smile in option prices"
2021-0198,3,"to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the phenomenon of price jump risk and to interpret bitcoin option valuation as exceptionally ambiguous"
2021-0198,4,"crucially, using hedging options for the bitcoin market, we also prove some important properties: bitcoin options follow a convex, but not strictly convex function"
2021-0198,5,this property provides adequate risk assessment for convex risk measure
2021-0199,0,wearable sensing technologies are having a worldwide impact on the creation of novel business opportunities and application services that are benefiting the common citizen
2021-0199,1,"by using these technologies, people have transformed the way they live, interact with each other and their surroundings, their daily routines, and how they monitor their health conditions"
2021-0199,2,"we review recent advances in the area of wearable sensing technologies, focusing on aspects such as sensor technologies, communication infrastructures, service infrastructures, security, and privacy"
2021-0199,3,"we also review the use of consumer wearables during the coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), and we discuss open challenges that must be addressed to further improve the efficacy of wearable sensing systems in the future"
2021-0200,0,"the covid-19 epidemic has accelerated the digital economys pervasiveness throughout the chinese economy, leading to a sharp rise in demand for contactless services in the financial industry"
2021-0200,1,"we examine the digital transformation of the chinese banking industry using the dea malmquist index method, supplemented by a distance function and time to compare the dynamic changes of productivity"
2021-0200,2,our paper then conducts an empirical study on the digital transformation of chinese commercial banks based on their improvements in efficiency
2021-0200,3,we analyze banks with superior efficiency in science and technology investment and evaluate their digital maturity and digital transformation experience
2021-0200,4,results show that digitalization investment has contributed to substantial production efficiency improvement for commercial banks
2021-0200,5,"however, heterogeneity ex-ists across banks"
2021-0200,6,we further advocate a path for banks digital transformation based on theoretical research and empirical digital transformation experience in this area
2021-0201,0,we study the personal credit market using unique individual-level data covering fintech and traditional lenders
2021-0201,1,"we show that fintech lenders acquire market share by lending first to higher-risk borrowers and then to safer borrowers, and rely mainly on hard information to make credit decisions"
2021-0201,2,fintech borrowers are significantly more likely to default than neighbor individuals with the same characteristics borrowing from traditional financial institutions
2021-0201,3,"furthermore, they tend to experience a short-lived reduction in the cost of credit, because their indebtedness increases more than non-fintech borrowers after loan origination"
2021-0201,4,"however, fintech lenders' pricing strategies are likely to take this into account"
2021-0202,0,"this study aims to examine and validate the impact of big data analytical capabilities (individual, organizational, and technological) on bank performance via the mediating role of fintech innovation in commercial banks operating in the united arab emirates (uae)"
2021-0202,1,"based on a literature review, resource-based theory, and financial innovation theory, an integrated conceptual framework was developed to guide the study"
2021-0202,2,"a quantitative survey approach was used, and the data was collected from 236 banks senior managers (it, financial, and marketers)"
2021-0202,3,amos 21 structural equation modeling (sem) was used to analyze and verify the study variables
2021-0202,4,the main findings revealed that big data analytical capabilities had a significant positive influence on bank performance

2021-0203,0,"this study uses fintech approaches, including web crawler technology with distributed architecture to select internet news messages largely and efficiently and a dictionary-based linguistic text mining to create sentiment variables, to explore the respective impacts of investors' optimism and pessimism on stock returns"
2021-0203,1,the construction of sentiment variables in network- and dictionary-based messages is more precise and variable than that in traditional-based messages
2021-0203,2,"our results show that firms with investors' optimistic sentiments have significantly higher stock returns in the current month, whereas those with pessimistic sentiments have significantly opposite effects"
2021-0203,3,the effect of both investors' optimism and pessimism on stock returns subsequently reverses
2021-0203,4,"then, the negative impacts of investors' largely pessimistic sentiments on stock returns are larger than the positive impacts of their largely optimistic sentiments within a quarter"
2021-0203,5,"next, investors' optimistic sentiments significantly raise stock return volatility by approximately a quarter, but their pessimistic sentiments have the opposite effects"
2021-0203,6,"furthermore, investors' high optimism more significantly and persistently raises stock return volatility than their general optimism, but the negative effects of their high pessimism on volatility become smaller and the persistence is shorter than general pessimism"
2021-0203,7,"in addition to the advantage of our methodology in creating sentiment variables, the simultaneous consideration of investors' optimism and pessimism to analyze the effects on the returns and the volatility of individual stocks in this study is more complete than previous related studies"
2021-0204,0,this article probes how uneven access to digital financial technologies maps onto and reinforces existing inequalities in the global south
2021-0204,1,"grounded in sen's capability approach, it deploys a network science approach to examine emergent factors reinforcing techno-financial inequality or the uneven access to fintech instruments, such as mobile money (mm) or m-banking services"
2021-0204,2,"focusing on a case study in dhaka, bangladesh, our findings suggest that unequal access to mm services is driven by a lack of capability inputs (e.g., low income and savings) needed to access certain goods (e.g., mobile phones)"
2021-0204,3,"this lack affects and is affected by personal conversion factors (e.g., functional and financial illiteracies), environmental conversion factors within the mm ecosystem (e.g., unreliable mm operators), and socio-cultural practices (e.g., gender norms) within which mm services are embedded"
2021-0204,4,we argue that these factors must be understood and analyzed as a network of converging forces that constrain digital financial capabilities and wellbeing within the peripheries of the global south
2021-0204,5,"this network understanding highlights the need to avoid one-size-fits-all policy interventions, including moving beyond techno-centric paradigms that privilege the proffering of technological fixes: dumping more fintech instruments into global south markets"
2021-0204,6,"rather, fintech policy models must recognize and carefully address the intersection of micro and macro factors inhibiting fintech access in the global south"
2021-0205,0,we examine the differences in the loan performance of fintech and bank borrowers in turkey
2021-0205,1,"using data of 5.5 million consumer loans by the fifth-largest private commercial bank in turkey and its fintech subsidiary, we demonstrate that fintech borrowers are on average younger, better educated, have higher income and savings levels, pay less interest and have better credit history than traditional bank borrowers"
2021-0205,2,"furthermore, fintech borrowers are less likely to default"
2021-0205,3,superior performance of fintech loans is driven by the fintech firm's ability to identify creditworthy borrowers among individuals with low-credit scores
2021-0205,4,these results contrast with the earlier evidence for developed markets where fintech borrowers are found to be more risky
2021-0136,0,mobile money is a widespread innovation throughout emerging countries
2021-0136,1,"since neither country-level institutions nor firm-level factors alone offer satisfactory explanations for mobile money's success, we draw on institutional theory to uncover how firms interact with institutions in target markets and explain the adoption of mobile money services"
2021-0136,2,we perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis on 110 mobile money services from 46 emerging countries revealing four recipes for widespread adoption
2021-0136,3,"in configuration 1, providers with high market power reach high adoptionirrespective of enabling institutionsif institutional voids are large"
2021-0136,4,"however, configurations 2 and 3 suggest that in most cases either enabling regulation or sufficient mobile and educational infrastructure are key for successful adoption"
2021-0136,5,"in these three configurations, providers are part of multinational telecommunication firms operating in markets with financial market voids"
2021-0136,6,configuration 4 suggests that certain fintech firms reach high adoption rates in more developed financial services sectors because they offer a broad scope of services
2021-0136,7,"we highlight the usefulness of a configurational lens for institutional theory to understand phenomena at the intersection of innovation, society, and business  especially in emerging markets with complex institutional settings"
2021-0206,0,peer-to-peer (p2p) lending is an emerging field in fintech and is an alternative source of personal loans
2021-0206,1,"however, p2p lending faces severe credit risk due to high information asymmetry and insufficient collateral"
2021-0206,2,we develop a novel heterogeneous stacking ensemble (hse) approach by using two real-world datasets to improve the loss given default (lgd) forecasting in the p2p lending domain
2021-0206,3,some special data in p2p lending and macroeconomic variables are employed as supplementary data sources to further enhance the model performance
2021-0206,4,"our proposal is compared with several popular models, including parametric and non-parametric ones, in terms of predictive accuracy and capital requirement"
2021-0206,5,"our finding reveals that special data in p2p lending (e.g., number of investors and loan description) and macroeconomic variables are powerful predictors of lgd in p2p lending"
2021-0206,6,the proposed hse model outperforms the benchmark models in most cases and significantly achieves optimal average ranks across all the evaluation metrics
2021-0206,7,the results remain robust under several validations
2021-0207,0,"the initial coin offerings (icos) subject has been gaining relevance due to its novelty, due to the capital amounts involved in the projects, as well as the disruptive technology and methods involved"
2021-0207,1,icos are a disruptive way to finance new projects which involve high risks and which are mainly technological
2021-0207,2,"this way to finance a project has been compared to others, namely, crowdfunding, venture capital or initial public offerings (ipos)"
2021-0207,3,"nevertheless, icos have very specific characteristics which make them unique"
2021-0207,4,we have studied the ico projects and developed a literature review on the topic
2021-0207,5,"building on the human capital theory (hct), we have also studied the importance given to the projects team and its perceived impact on projects success"
2021-0207,6,our contribution to fill in this literature gap was to develop an econometric model which measures the impact of teams characteristics on the success of a project
2021-0207,7,the database was collected with the combination of two data sources and is composed of 3158 profiles and 340 ico projects
2021-0207,8,we have concluded that team variables are significant contributors to projects success
2021-0207,9,our data suggests that peoples location contributes to projects success as well as promoters networks
2021-0207,10,the ratings attributed by external parties to the project are also indicators of success
2021-0207,11,"several control variables such as the implementation of thresholds to investment, the number of currencies accepted, the platform in which the ico is developed, the existence of bonus schemes and the year of the project were found to be statistically significant having an impact on projects outcome"
2021-0066,0,prior research suggests that corporate boards and directors play important roles in firm strategy and performance
2021-0066,1,"in this paper, we examine an important yet under-explored avenue and focus on their role in overcoming the multilevel psychic distance (pd) faced by internationalizing small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) originating from an emerging market"
2021-0066,2,"analysing indian fintech smes, using multiple case studies, our findings reveal that boards contribute important network-level resources and knowledge about foreign markets, which in turn assists internationalizing smes in mitigating pd"
2021-0066,3,"we demonstrate that the human and social capital of boards play important, yet distinctly different, roles in mitigating pd at pre- and post-internationalization phases"
2021-0066,4,"at the pre-internationalization phase, directors prior international and industry experience, as well as board interlocks and prior connections, are most valuable, whereas at the post-entry phase, transnational boards, and those with stronger trust-based personal relationships (i.e"
2021-0066,5,"greater depth of social capital, facilitate faster experiential learning"
2021-0066,6,"taken together, our findings contribute novel insights into the mechanisms through which boards affect the outcomes of firms operating, and originating from, extreme institutional environments"
2021-0066,7,"further, we draw implications for research and practice"
2021-0007,0,the increasing pervasiveness of technology-driven firms that offer financial services has led to growing pressure on traditional banks to modernize their core business activities and services
2021-0007,1,many banks tackle the challenges of digitalization by cooperating with startup firms that offer technology-driven financial services and novel service packages (fintechs)
2021-0007,2,"in this article, we examine which banks typically collaborate with fintechs, how intensely they do so, and which form of alliance they prefer"
2021-0007,3,"using hand-collected data covering the largest banks from canada, france, germany, and the united kingdom, we provide detailed evidence on the different forms of alliances occurring in practice"
2021-0007,4,we show that banks are significantly more likely to form alliances with fintechs when they pursue a well-defined digital strategy and/or employ a chief digital officer
2021-0007,5,"moreover, in line with incomplete contract theory, we find that banks more frequently invest in small fintechs but often build product-related collaborations with larger fintechs"
2021-0208,0,"nowadays, understanding the complexity of fintech is vitally important due to its practical implication"
2021-0208,1,"thereby, it is one of the most relevant topics of financial research"
2021-0208,2,in the study we investigate the impact of fintech into social and economic development within modern society
2021-0208,3,"in particular, the attention is paid to the fintech companies' and the trends within ukrainian financial technology market"
2021-0208,4,"the further study concerns the nature of fintech innovative effects, namely: client, business and social effects"
2021-0208,5,"for further practical use, it is proposed to define fintech startups competencies, considering definition and functions of the main ukrainian startups innovative activity in financial sector"
2021-0209,0,"the implementation of machine learning models that lie at the heart of traditional financial institutions like banks has primarily remained a ""black box"""
2021-0209,1,"techniques such as extreme gradient boosting, random forest and support vector machines are challenging to interpret"
2021-0209,2,this restricts the commercial application of these techniques as they lack transparency and often hide potential biases inherited by the machine learning algorithms
2021-0209,3,"ultimately, this further limits the ability of these techniques to assess an individual's ability to pay for a loan"
2021-0209,4,"the biases lead to credit applications being rejected or individuals being offered ""unfair""credit terms based on their credit risk"
2021-0209,5,recently there have been attempts to predict credit default risk in literature
2021-0209,6,"however, the majority of studies are conducted using data from developed countries, where most individuals are banked and data is complete"
2021-0209,7,"therefore, this study aims to investigate and compare statistical classification techniques and machine learning techniques, with the focus being on interpreting the results and explaining which features contribute to the credit approval processes that may excel in both developed and developing countries"
2021-0209,8,"to achieve this goal, we explored three datasets from fintech organisations, namely home credit, xente, and super lender"
2021-0209,9,two of the datasets are from uganda and nigeria (developing countries in africa) and one from the usa (a developed country in north america)
2021-0209,10,we adopted shapley additive explanation (shap) to interpret the models
2021-0209,11,"using shap, we identified that for all three datasets, the external ratings, total due and loan duration increase the likelihood of an individual defaulting on a loan"
2021-0209,12,"additionally, we also found that the tree-based algorithms, particularly the extreme gradient boosting algorithm outperforms logistic regression, random forest and other statistical learning techniques"
2021-0210,0,this article examines the roles digital technologies have played in propelling the shifts in modes of financial governance which have been led by the chinese communist party and enacted by a wide spectrum of regulative actors
2021-0210,1,"based on analyses of the laws, policies and regulations surrounding digital financial technologies, or so-called fintechs, as well as in-depth interviews with government officials and fintech business executives, i argue that the proliferation of fintechs challenged the existing regulatory schemes defined by the central bank and the state council"
2021-0210,2,this forced a reconsideration of the chinese governments hegemonic strategies in governing the rapidly changing financial industries
2021-0210,3,"while digital technologies have been promoted to accomplish the goals set by the party for financial marketization and modernization, a set of institutions including regulatory, organizational and normative rules have been developed to strengthen the partys control over the digitization of finance"
2021-0210,4,this contradiction is pivotal to understanding the partys financial policymaking in the digital age
2021-0211,0,booming online consumer lending encounters high credit risk and thus needs well-designed credit scoring models
2021-0211,1,"as a supplementary data source, multilevel macroeconomic variables (mvs), which means mixed regions, data frequency, and lags of mvs, are combined with application data for credit scoring"
2021-0211,2,"moreover, we propose a bayesian mv selection and lag optimization method to handle the highly correlated mvs and capture flexible lag effects"
2021-0211,3,a structural model for consumer default behavior is proposed to analyze the potential role of multilevel mvs in theoretically predicting default loans
2021-0211,4,"validated on a real-world dataset from an anonymous chinese online consumer lending platform, the empirical results confirm that multilevel mvs are significant determinants of consumer credit risk"
2021-0211,5,the comparison of classification performance further implies the superiority of incorporating multilevel mvs and the proposed mv selection and lag optimization method relative to benchmarks
2021-0211,6,gradient boosting decision tree-based approaches provide significantly better performance than industry benchmarks while maintaining interpretability via shapley additive explanations values
2021-0212,0,"on 1 september 2020, australias enhanced regulatory sandbox (ers) finally became operational"
2021-0212,1,"the ers replaced the previous fintech sandbox established and operated by the australian securities and investments commission (asic), which had existed since 2016 but attracted only seven participants"
2021-0212,2,this research analyses how and why australias sandbox framework  with its unique non-authorisation model of operation  has evolved until now and evaluates whether the new enhanced sandbox regime can help to achieve its stated objectives
2021-0212,3,this article shows that the current sandbox reform merely scrapes the surface of the many challenges underlying asics fintech sandbox and argues that these challenges can only be adequately resolved by revising the chosen sandbox model and switching to an authorisation-based sandbox design
2021-0213,0,"this study aims to provide an attempt by raising a framework for assessing the digital technology perspective in the application of financial technology by consumers, especially in the era of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 in indonesia"
2021-0213,1,"digital technology in fintech in collaboration with online transportation is utilized by quite a few big firms in indonesia to meet the needs of consumers during strict, large-scale restrictions but not lockdown"
2021-0213,2,this paper mainly acknowledged the problem related to digitizing solid digital technology which prioritizes technology 4.0
2021-0213,3,"digital technology applications, especially among the millennial generation regarding the accessibility, pace and value of financial services are increasingly in demand"
2021-0213,4,"this research spent 5.5 months with millennial respondents who are accustomed to using everyday technology applications in jakarta, depok and tangerang and surrounding areas"
2021-0213,5,the method of analyzing data in a quantitative way to find findings is complemented by discussion
2021-0213,6,the findings prove that
2021-0213,7,all variables have positive strong effect on driving the choice of digital fintech technology in ordering food and others to survive during the pandemic of covid-19
2021-0213,8,"the existence of digital-based technology applications related to the internet, big data, smart mobile phones, safe and comfortable technology power has motivated consumers to use them"
2021-0213,9,"in conclusion, there are several new business opportunities open to newcomers in the digital financial sector and other accessories using information systems and information ecosystems"
2021-0214,0,the integration of the financial industry and financial technology (fintech) plays a pivotal role in increasing financial services reach and inclusion for the large unbanked population in indonesia
2021-0214,1,"fintech adoption optimization expands the financial access to formal financial institutions, especially to vulnerable groups such as the unbanked population who predominantly reside in rural areas far from formal financial institutions"
2021-0214,2,fintech is viewed as a game changer to bring finance to the unreached communities via information technology and digital financial landscape
2021-0214,3,"in this causal research, data collection was done via online questionnaires to 485 fintech users between december 2020 and april 2021"
2021-0214,4,data analysis and path modelling was performed using smartpls 3.0 software
2021-0214,5,"result shows user innovativeness as a significant predictor, directly and indirectly affecting the adoption of fintech in indonesia, while user attitude found the most important factor towards fintech adoption"
2021-0214,6,"financial literacy is the least important variable to predict fintech adoption, contrary to popular belief"
2021-0214,7,this indicates that fintech usage requires less financial literacy and is potential to reach unbanked population and those with low financial literacy
2021-0214,8,"to make fintech more inclusive, the government needs to accelerate improving information and communications technology (ict) infrastructure such as widening mobile broadband penetration and soft infrastructure by encouraging fintech startup, allowing regulatory sandbox for startups, and driving financial institutions to innovate through fintech to bring financial services to unbanked population"
2021-0215,0,"with transformative evolution involving crypto-assets, machine learning applications and data-driven finance models, complex regulatory and policy issues are emerging"
2021-0215,1,inadequate frameworks in fintech markets create regulatory friction and regulatory fragmentation
2021-0215,2,these limitations continue to feature when piecemeal regulatory transition occurs
2021-0215,3,the danger of eu member states being left behind in the fintech innovation race if the regulatory landscape is cumbersome or incomplete for new business models is real
2021-0215,4,regulatory lag and regulatory friction also act as a disenabler for ease of cross-border fintech trade in the eu
2021-0215,5,this article critically engages with the manner in which the regulatory sandbox has rapidly gained critical mass in member states as a valuable adaptive measure supporting a route to market for fintech entrepreneurs
2021-0215,6,"against the backdrop of the european commissions digital finance strategy, the article further advances scholarship on fintech in the eu by probing the eus resulting regulatory dilemma, undertaking a systematic evaluation of the continuum of complex policy options available to the european union in response to the spreading regulatory sandbox phenomenon"
2021-0135,0,many people share investment ideas online
2021-0135,1,this study investigates whether individual investors trade on investment-related internet postings
2021-0135,2,"we use unique data from a social trading platform that allow us to observe the shared portfolios of traders, their posted comments, and the replicating transactions of followers"
2021-0135,3,we find robust evidence that followers increasingly replicate shared portfolios of traders after the posting of comments
2021-0135,4,"however, postings do not help followers identify portfolios that deliver superior performance in the future"
2021-0135,5,"in a cross-sectional analysis, we show that it is mainly followers typically considered to be unsophisticated who trade after comment postings"
2021-0216,0,tech-leading organizations are embracing the forthcoming artificial intelligence revolution
2021-0216,1,intelligent systems are replacing and cooperating with traditional software components
2021-0216,2,"thus, the same development processes and standards in software engineering ought to be complied in artificial intelligence systems"
2021-0216,3,this study aims to understand the processes by which artificial intelligence-based systems are developed and how state-of-the-art lifecycle models fit the current needs of the industry
2021-0216,4,"we conducted an exploratory case study at ing, a global bank with a strong european base"
2021-0216,5,we interviewed 17 people with different roles and from different departments within the organization

2021-0052,1,"using detailed data on the almost 1000 fintech startups in france to date, we find that most fintechs are geographically clustered and that the location of new fintech startups is affected, among other things, by the size of clusters and the presence of incubators"
2021-0052,2,"larger clusters attract more new fintech startups, and incubators are shown to be an effective mechanism to attract new fintech startups"
2021-0052,3,we further examine entrepreneurial exits of fintechs and find that being located in a larger cluster reduces the risk of failure but increases the likelihood of being acquired
2021-0052,4,increased competition within a given segment of fintech increases failure rates
2021-0052,5,"moreover, the risk of failure is significantly lower for fintech startups that have been developed in an incubator"
2021-0232,0,"in order to achieve the goal of ""non-nuclear homeland and realize the policy target that renewable energy accounts for 20% of power generation, the taiwan government has actively promoted the integration of energy generation"

2021-0237,0,a distributed stock exchange system encompasses multiple network hosts that participate in the sharing and exchange of resources
2021-0237,1,"in such exchanges, the mediator or stock exchange must manage and delineate all operations in a cohesive manner"
2021-0237,2,"stock exchange (se) also acts as the transaction manager to provide consistent, isolated, durable, and atomic transactions for participating entities"
2021-0237,3,"however, the work for the stock exchange is not so straightforward as it may sound"
2021-0237,4,"with multiple transactions happening per second, the global serializability and concurrency control becomes an issue resulting in multiple threats and vulnerabilities"
2021-0237,5,we propose a novel stock exchange that integrates time series prediction to distributed transactions and understanding the rapid global transactions and limitations of resources at the stock exchange
2021-0237,6,we use distributed acyclic graph (dag) based distributed ledger technology iota to provide security and consensus for independent users

2021-0239,1,"using data from the chinese general social survey and the index of digital financial inclusion, this study examines the impact of fintech on the gender wage gap"
2021-0239,2,we find that fintech (i) narrows the gender wage gap
2021-0239,3,"(ii) reduces capital constraints and operating costs, thereby promoting female entrepreneurship, driving more women into employment, and enabling women to increase their wages and bargaining power within the household"
2021-0239,4,"and (iii) positively impacts the wages of women (and men) who have lower family economic status, and helps women (but not men) counter the risk of decline in wages caused by childbearing and caring under the two-child policy"
2021-0239,5,these findings have important policy implications and provide evidence of women's improving economic conditions leading to a reduced gender wage gap
2021-0240,0,this study reviews the literature of online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending from 2008 until 2020 as an emergent but fast spreading phenomenon in the context of digital finance
2021-0240,1,previous literature is geographically skewed towards united states and china with focus on determinants of funding success and loan attributes
2021-0240,2,"recent studies shift from using logit and survival analysis methods to examine funding success and default predictions, towards applying artificial intelligence"
2021-0240,3,there is a controversial debate regarding adopting a self-regulatory approach versus stricter financial institutions-based regulations with a few studies suggesting a hybrid approach
2021-0240,4,"we suggest several avenues for future research, such as examining the determinants and performance of p2p lending platforms in emerging and developing markets"
2021-0240,5,"regulatory differences, the effects of behavioral characteristics such as cultural impact, language, information technology literacy, and the innovation quotient on p2p funding attributes"

2021-0032,0,"this paper is one of the first to offer a comprehensive analysis of the impact of green finance related policies in china, utilizing text analysis and panel data from 290 cities between 2011 and 2018"
2021-0032,1,employing the semi-parametric difference-in-differences (sdid) we show that overall china's green finance related policies have led to a significant reduction in industrial gas emissions in the review period
2021-0032,2,"additionally, we found that fintech development contributes to the depletion of sulphur dioxide emissions and has a positive impact on environmental protection investment initiatives"
2021-0032,3,china is poised to be a global leader in green finance policy implementation and regulators need to accelerate the formulation of green finance products and enhance the capacity of financial institutions to offer green credit
2021-0032,4,"while minimizing the systemic risk fintech poses, policy makers should encourage fintechs to actively participate in environmental protection initiatives that promote green consumption"
2021-0241,0,"the availability of financial technology services, accessibility, ease of use and performance, transaction costs, and service security of fintech have a positive and significant effect on banks' customer satisfaction"
2021-0241,1,"effective financial technology services assist and preserve customers, who increase the revenues generated by the banks and economic growth"
2021-0117,0,current concerns about environmental issues have led to many new trends in technology and financial management
2021-0117,1,"within this context of digital transformation and sustainable finance, fintech has emerged as an alternative to traditional financial institutions"
2021-0117,2,"this paper, through a literature review and case study approach, analyzes the relationship between fintech and sustain-ability, and the different areas of collaboration between fintech and sustainable finance, from both a theoretical and descriptive perspective, while giving specific examples of current technological platforms"
2021-0117,3,"additionally, in this paper, two fintech initiatives (clarity ai and pensumo) are described, as well as several proposals to improve the detection of greenwashing and other deceptive behavior by firms"

2021-0117,5,"furthermore, this paper highlights the importance of european and global regulation, mainly from the perspective of consumer protection"
2021-0242,0,rationally justifying bitcoin's immense price fluctuations has remained a persistent challenge for both investors and researchers in this field
2021-0242,1,a primary reason is our potential weakness toward robustly quantifying unquantifiable risks or ambiguity in bitcoin returns
2021-0242,2,this paper introduces a behavioral channel to argue that the degree of ambiguity aversion is a prominent source of abnormal returns from investment in bitcoin markets
2021-0242,3,"using data over a ten-year period, we show that bitcoin investors exhibit, on average, an increasing aversion to ambiguity"
2021-0242,4,"furthermore, investors are found to earn abnormal returns only when ambiguity is low"
2021-0242,5,robustness exercises reassure on the validity of our results
2021-0243,0,fintech companies are challenging established financial institutions' dominance by offering the same products with a superior customer experience and delivering new features faster
2021-0243,1,the adoption of agile software development partially enables this competitive advantage
2021-0243,2,"in response to this challenge, banks explore how they can improve their agile processes"
2021-0243,3,"lhv, a mid-sized bank, uses agile practices but faces the challenge of further improvement to stay competitive with fintech companies"
2021-0243,4,"in this article, we explore how lhv can improve its agile software development process"
2021-0243,5,we conduct a case study at lhv where we first derive eight change proposals based on a literature review and interviews
2021-0243,6,"then, we report on how lhv implemented the change proposals and their perceived impact"
2021-0243,7,our results stress the importance of taking a coherent approach to improving agile processes by considering both business units and operations involved in the product life-cycle
2021-0243,8,"it is also necessary to align organizational structures to enable team autonomy by, for instance, decentralizing decision authority"
2021-0243,9,"finally, it is beneficial to adapt agile practices to their context and have an it architecture and technology supporting the agile approach"
2021-0061,0,technology advancements have increased the hopes of banks around the world in terms of securing a prominent place in global finance
2021-0061,1,the chinese government explicitly regards the development of financial technology (fintech) as an essential strategy for improving banking performance
2021-0061,2,"however, the debate on the impact of costly fintech innovation on chinese banking performance has not been resolved"
2021-0061,3,this study therefore applies the data envelopment analysis (dea) approach to define the metafrontier cost malmquist productivity index (cmm) under variable returns to scale (vrs) in order to analyze the factors and identify the sources of changes in cost-side productivity and their economic implications
2021-0061,4,"the results show that the average cmm score was 1.0626, implying a 6.26% improvement in the cost malmquist productivity during the study period"
2021-0061,5,"the results of implementing the system-gmm model also indicate that the greater the banks share of mobile device transactions and the larger the banks third-party payment transactions volume, the higher the cost productivity growth rate"
2021-0014,0,"with the promotion of the concept of green development on a global scale, various industries are pursuing high profit returns while also considering the harmony between human and nature"
2021-0014,1,green finance is put forward under this background
2021-0014,2,"in this paper, 815 green finance and energy policy literatures are retrieved from the web of science database"
2021-0014,3,"we first carry out descriptive statistical analysis, including the overall growth, publication sources, research regions and high-level scientific research institutions"
2021-0014,4,"after that, we conduct clusters analysis to find the research hotspots in recent years and point out the research trends in the future"
2021-0014,5,"important journals, scholars, research findings and future research focuses of green finance and energy policy are identified in this paper"
2021-0014,6,"the purpose of this paper is to promote the research and discussion of green finance, and to conduct a clear policy-related discussion on its impact on the energy field"
2021-0014,7,four possible green finance-related energy policies are also summarized
2021-0014,8,"this research facilitates a systematic and comprehensive understanding of green finance and energy policy research, and offers that green bonds, government subsidies and carbon dioxide emissions are the research opportunities in the future, and further research can be done by combining fintech, big data and blockchain"
2021-0024,0,this paper examines whether the development of the financial technology (fintech) industry affects cost efficiency and the technology adopted for china's banking industry over the period 20032017
2021-0024,1,"fintech industry development indices are constructed using fintech enterprise-level data, and these indices measure the development extent of entire fintech industry and four sub-industries including (1) credit, deposit and capitalraising services, (2) payment, clearing and settlement services, (3) investment management services and (4) market support services"
2021-0024,2,the relevant efficiency scores for chinese banks under different ownership structures are measured by applying the stochastic metafrontier approach
2021-0024,3,the results show that state-owned commercial banks have the lowest cost efficiency and operate under inferior technology
2021-0024,4,"when considering the influence of fintech development, fintech innovations not only improve the cost efficiency of banks, but also enhance the technology used by banks"
2021-0024,5,this double beneficial effect is more significant in the case of market support service innovations
2021-0082,0,credit scoring has been attracting increasing attention in the chinese consumer financial industry
2021-0082,1,"traditional approaches are easily influenced by sample selection bias because they use accepted applicant samples only, while the applicant population also includes rejected applicants"
2021-0082,2,"reject inference is a technique to infer good/bad labels for rejected applicants, which can overcome biases in credit scoring"
2021-0082,3,"however, previously proposed reject inference methods usually ignore the imbalanced distribution in accepted data, which means that good applicants are much more than bad ones in most practical consumer loan applications"
2021-0082,4,both the neglect of rejected data and the imbalanced distribution in accepted data weaken the performance of current credit scoring models
2021-0082,5,"in this paper, we propose a novel reject inference framework that takes into account the imbalanced data distribution for consumer credit scoring"
2021-0082,6,"first, we use an advanced graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to solve the reject inference problem, which is called label spreading"
2021-0082,7,"second, faced with an imbalanced distribution of good and bad samples in accepted applicants, we conduct imbalanced learning using a modified synthetic minority over-sampling technique before reject inference"
2021-0082,8,"then, six binary classifiers are studied in our proposed framework for credit scoring modeling"
2021-0082,9,"finally, we present the results of four exact experiments as well as online a/b tests for performance evaluation using data provided by a leading chinese fintech company"
2021-0082,10,"empirical results indicate that the proposed framework performs better than traditional scoring models across different evaluation metrics, representing a progressive method that promotes credit scoring research as well as improving fintech practices"
2021-0036,0,this opinion paper addresses and contributes to the discourse on whether there is a central artifact that captures the essence of the information systems (is) discipline
2021-0036,1,"it argues that the is discipline can, and should be, faithfully captured by an is artifact"
2021-0036,2,we offer a theoretical conception of the is artifact by drawing upon general systems theory (gst)
2021-0036,3,key concepts of gst are distilled as meta-principles which inform our formulation of the is artifact
2021-0036,4,we use the meta-principles of the is artifact to develop salient assertions that theorize what an is is
2021-0036,5,"to demonstrate the appropriateness of our conception, we illustrate how the assertions we developed are consistent with patterns related to emerging topics in is research, notably, healthcare and it, and fintech"
2021-0036,6,we formulate a research agenda on these emerging topicsbased upon the conceptions developed in the paperto guide future research
2021-0036,7,"we conclude with the contributions and implications of our study, including the relevance for it-enabled work in the era of the covid-19 pandemic"
2021-0127,0,financial technology (fintech) has flourished in recent years
2021-0127,1,"from 2008 to 2016, the global investment in fintech increased more than threefold"
2021-0127,2,"however, most of the extant literature has focused on fintech innovation or the litigation of financial patents, while few studies have explored the effects of fintech patents in the financial industry"
2021-0127,3,"therefore, this paper employs machine learning algorithms for classification and association rule purposes in order to analyze the relationship between fintech patents and performance from 2008 to 2016"
2021-0127,4,our results show that fintech patents can indeed improve the profitability of the financial industry
2021-0127,5,we also find that the influence of return on asset is more significant than that of return on equity
2021-0126,0,the business conditions surrounding japanese regional banks have deteriorated for decades amid continuing ultra-low interest rates
2021-0126,1,we examine stock price reactions of regional banks to information technology (it) investment announcements and analyze the factors that affect market responses
2021-0126,2,we provide three main findings
2021-0126,3,"first, regional banks stock prices as a whole do not respond significantly to it investment announcements"
2021-0126,4,"second, stock price responses to it investment announcements are more positively correlated with the regional banks size and with the individual shareholders ratio"
2021-0126,5,"third, regional banks stock prices respond more negatively when there's news regarding equity investments to fintech companies"
2021-0244,0,"in today's business era, it is a very difficult to predict the extract value of the stock market index, accordingly the field has a notable scope for research in forecasting the stock price index and it's movement"
2021-0244,1,"diverse factors such as market trends, behavioral finance, economic indicators, exchange rates, gross domestic product growth, interest rates, unemployment, efficient market, stock option and evaluation and value investors"
2021-0244,2,the paper represents and compares the basic types of input variables and modular overview of the variables and its relations to predict the daily stock market
2021-0244,3,the model consists of 36 kinds of financial and economic features
2021-0244,4,a model through artificial neural network is developed to predict the daily stock market index
2021-0244,5,a multi-layer feed forward network is developed to discuss the issues predicting the stock market index
2021-0244,6,"fintech favors every investor, by bringing more relevant and richer data to our fingertips"
2021-0244,7,"factors are evaluated using python, results are satisfactory"
2021-0245,0,fintech is the innovative use of technology in the design and delivery of financial products and services
2021-0245,1,this study aims to statistically investigate the fintech and other determinants that affect the profitability of six state-owned commercial banks (sobs) in china using the data from the 2014-2019 period
2021-0245,2,"theoretically, fintech serves as a disruption for its banking services through adverse impacts on asset business, liquidity business and intermediary business"
2021-0245,3,"empirically, the result shows that the development of fintech has a negative impact on the profitability of sobs and the regression results from the ols estimation, the fgls estimation, the prais-winsten estimation and the fe estimation are compared to ensure the validity of the statistical inference"
2021-0246,0,portugal offers few solutions for sharing private information on negative debts and the existing solutions are restricted or unknown to the general public
2021-0246,1,"therefore, a comprehensive solution, which aims to link the industrial, commercial and services sectors, based on an online platform, with automatic and large-scale adhesion, has not yet been tried"
2021-0246,2,"this article analyzes the need for a platform to reduce information asymmetry between people and companies, in order to minimize adverse selection in the portuguese credit market"
2021-0246,3,"encouraging good payers to have access to interest-free or lower-rate credit, ensuring that creditors have minimum conditions for risk analysis and the respective effective collection of overdue debts is the purpose of the nice payer system, proposed here"
2021-0246,4,"the article presents a scalable prototype of the proposed system, for managing negative information and whose purpose is to support the existence of a private credit bureau with multinational operations"
2021-0247,0,information technology is a driving innovation in the financial industry now
2021-0247,1,fintech is a disruptive innovation capable of changing traditional financial markets
2021-0247,2,"although the fintech has been widely discussed, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of the term in the scientific literature"
2021-0247,3,"this article investigates the concept of fintech, discusses the emergence and development of fintech sector, and points out new routes and trends in the field of study"
2021-0247,4,"this research focuses on the next generation technologies impact on fintech, key drivers and challenges in the global fintech industry"

2021-0247,7,"from practical aspect, this paper is also a direction for companies to help them find out promising technology in fintech"
2021-0247,8,the paper can inspire future research on fintech and its application in the business world
2021-0248,0,this paper provides a detailed analysis of the difference between the chinese stock market and the u.s
2021-0248,1,stock market under the development of financial technology
2021-0248,2,"in conclusion, we find that the chinese stock market is more dominated by retail investors, but the united states owns more stocks, mostly held by institutional investors, and has a better financial mindset"
2021-0248,3,the behavior of investors in the chinese stock market is mainly the excessive speculation of investors in the chinese market
2021-0248,4,this is one of the reasons for the many fluctuations in the chinese stock market
2021-0248,5,"due to the speculative nature of china's stock market, the floating ratio reflects the management mechanism of china's stock market and helps to observe the correlation with the u.s"
2021-0248,6,stock market
2021-0248,7,and technology and digitalization affect the trading of the stock market
2021-0248,8,"this research is correlational, and there is no causality implied"
2021-0249,0,"in the recent years, data science methods have been developed considerably and have consequently found their way into many business processes in banking and finance"
2021-0249,1,one example is the review and approval process of credit applications where they are employed with the aim to reduce rare but costly credit defaults in portfolios of loans
2021-0249,2,but there are challenges
2021-0249,3,"since defaults are rare events, it iseven with machine learning (ml) techniquesdifficult to improve prediction accuracy and improvements are often marginal"
2021-0249,4,"furthermore, while from an event prediction point of view, a non-default is the same as a default, from an economic point of view much more relevant to the end user it is not due to the high asymmetry in cost"
2021-0249,5,"last, there are regulatory constraints when it comes to the adoption of advanced ml, hence the call for explainable artificial intelligence (xai) issued by regulatory bodies like finma and bafin"
2021-0249,6,"in our study, we will address these challenges"
2021-0249,7,"in particular, based on an exemplary use case, we show how ml methods can be adapted to the specific needs of credit assessment and how, in the case of strongly asymmetric costs of wrong forecasts, it makes sense to optimize not for accuracy but for an economic target function"
2021-0249,8,"we showcase this for two simple and ad hoc explainable ml algorithms, finding that in the case of credit approval, surprisingly high rejection rates contribute to maximizing profit"

2021-0258,0,"gba has a strong foundation of fintech industry, and its industrial talents are crucial for promoting the innovation of fintech in the bay area"
2021-0258,1,"through the investigation of the aggregation of fintech talent in the gba and the comparison of talent policies among guangzhou, hong kong and shenzhen, we have found that there is still relatively large room for improvement in terms of the structural proportion of age, academic qualifications and professional of talents, life and work satisfaction of talents, and talent aggregation system"
2021-0258,2,"therefore, we proposed some policy recommendations such as strengthening the deep integration of industry-university-research, improving the education and training mechanism and salary incentive distribution mechanism for fintech enterprises, implementing a more open policy on talent introduction, and realizing the talent integration of the gba"
2021-0259,0,"fair digital signature of contracts and agreements is an essential process in any electronic commerce scenario, and therefore also in data marketplaces, where the relationships and agreements among the different parties (consumers and providers) are more dynamic"
2021-0259,1,"in multi-party contract signing, n parties wish to sign a contract in a such a way that either all signatories obtain evidence of the signing or none obtains conflicting evidence regarding the honest signatories"
2021-0259,2,the exchange must be fair
2021-0259,3,"in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multi-party contract signing protocol"
2021-0259,4,"this solution does not require the existence or potential intervention of a trusted third party (ttp), thus avoiding the difficulty of n signatories agreeing upon a ttp"
2021-0259,5,"in addition, this proposal meets the necessary requirements: fairness, timeliness, non-repudiation of origin, and non-repudiation of receipt"
2021-0259,6,"furthermore, confidentiality can be easily achieved"
2021-0259,7,"to minimize costs associated with the use of blockchain, it should be invoked in the case of exception (analogous to optimistic solutions with a ttp) and by only one of the n signatories"
2021-0259,8,"however, when the use of blockchain is required, we show that its cost is within perfectly manageable margins"
2021-0125,0,cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are breakthrough financial technologies that promise to revolutionize the digital economy
2021-0125,1,"unfortunately, their long-term adoption in the business world is imperiled by a lack of stability that manifests as dramatic swings in transaction fees and severe participant dissatisfaction"
2021-0125,2,"to date, there has been little academic effort to study how system participants react to volatility in fee movements"
2021-0125,3,"our study addresses this research gap by conceptualizing the bitcoin platform as a data space market and studying how market equilibrium forms between users who demand data space while trying to avoid transaction delays, and miners who supply data space while trying to maximize fee revenues"
2021-0125,4,our empirical analysis based on past bitcoin transactions reveals the existence of a relatively flat downward-sloping demand curve and a much steeper upward-sloping supply curve
2021-0125,5,"regarding users, the inelastic nature of demand signals the utility of bitcoin as a niche platform for transactions that are otherwise difficult to conduct"
2021-0125,6,this result challenges the belief that users may easily abandon bitcoin technology given rising transaction costs
2021-0125,7,we also find that the use of bitcoins as a trading asset is associated with higher levels of tolerance to fees
2021-0125,8,"regarding miners, the comparatively elastic nature of supply indicates that higher fees stimulate mining by a larger magnitude than suppressing demand"
2021-0125,9,"this finding implies that, ceteris paribus, the bitcoin system turns to self-regulate transaction fees in an efficient manner"
2021-0125,10,our work has implications for the management of congestion in blockchain-based systems and more broadly for the stability of cryptocurrency markets
2021-0260,0,online financial technology products are an important consumer finance innovation
2021-0260,1,"while a large body of previous research has focused on initial adoption and consumer willingness to use these products, little research explores the continued use of these products beyond the initial adoption phase"
2021-0260,2,"in particular, special attention should be paid to how users trust and perceptions of privacy and security affect continued use behavior"
2021-0260,3,"this paper integrates the expectation confirmation model of information system continuance (ecm-isc), the information system success model (issm) and the security and trust literatures to investigate continued use of online financial technology"
2021-0260,4,"to test the research model, we collected 398 valid questionnaires from ant credit pay users"
2021-0260,5,"the research results show that system and service quality positively impact users expectation confirmation, while information quality has no significant impact"
2021-0260,6,expectation confirmation and perceived usefulness positively affect user satisfaction
2021-0260,7,"moreover, the users perception of privacy and security plays a vital role in user satisfaction"
2021-0260,8,satisfaction and perceived trust jointly promote users continuance behaviors
2021-0260,9,findings of this study indicates the importance of the information system success factors and security factors due to their influence on the continued use of fintech products
2021-0260,10,this conclusion has implications for enterprises in improving the product qualities and enhancing the degree of security to meet user needs
2021-0124,0,the purpose of this study is two-folded
2021-0124,1,"the first purpose is to examine the perception of islamic finance experts and shariah scholars on the islamic cryptocurrency (i.e., goldx and onegram)"
2021-0124,2,the question is whether it has a role in reconciling cryptocurrency in islamic finance
2021-0124,3,the second is to introduce the new islamic cryptocurrency to serve these rich islamic populaces
2021-0124,4,the study used a qualitative research approach by conducting interviews to explore the islamic scholars views on the framework of the new islamic cryptocurrency
2021-0124,5,the scholars have been deemed to meet particular requirements of having comprehensive knowledge and have extensive experience in both the islamic shariah and cryptocurrency
2021-0124,6,"accordingly, the number of such scholars was limited, and eventually, with the access offered only to five scholars from different islamic countries"
2021-0124,7,we thoroughly analyzed the collected data from the interviews
2021-0124,8,the findings reveal that islamic law is absent on the essential models for the conventional cryptocurrency utilization(such as bitcoin) as either a legitimate or illicit apparatus exchange device
2021-0124,9,"consequently, introducing new islamic cryptocurrencies is to reconcile cryptocurrencies such as goldx and onegram"
2021-0124,10,they will play a vital role in attracting more than 1.5 billion muslims around the globe to enter the world of cryptocurrency
2021-0261,0,the growth of digital technologies has changed the way of doing financial transactions
2021-0261,1,"even though the transaction value for financial technology in 2018 grew by 24%, the financial inclusion rate in indonesia is still low, with 64% unbanked"
2021-0261,2,the aim of the study was to analyze the factors of the growing digital technology that influence customer decisions in choosing financial technology services using customer knowledge as the intervening variable
2021-0261,3,"the growing digital technology is measured using social networking, regulatory services, and financial service facilities variables"
2021-0261,4,the sample of this research focused on the microsegment customers located in java island
2021-0261,5,statistical data are analyzed using algorithm pls
2021-0261,6,results show that customer decision in choosing financial technology services was strongly influenced by customer knowledge
2021-0261,7,"customer knowledge was formed from information gathered from the social network, the formal assurance by the government, the financial service facilities, and financial inclusivity"
2021-0261,8,"the study recommends a need to educate, promote, and provide adequate information to increase familiarity and literacy rate with regard to financial technology"
2021-0261,9,the study also recommends an urgent clear government regulation to protect the interests of customers and industries
2021-0262,0,crowfunding is a type of financial technology platform that funding a project or venture by raising money from a large number of people
2021-0262,1,"there are three actors in crowdfunding, first is the project owner, second is the crowdfunder and third is the donator"
2021-0262,2,as a new way of raising money for business financing crowdfunding is very interesting subject to discuss
2021-0262,3,"this paper is a research paper, to analyze the utilization of crowdfunding in business financing in indonesia and to analyze the obstacle of crowdfunding in business financing in indonesia"
2021-0262,4,the methodology of this research is an empirical legal research
2021-0262,5,"the research finding are indonesian business association already utilized the crowdfunding platform to finance several business sectors such as realestate, modern store franchise, movie production etc"
2021-0262,6,"the obstacle of crowdfunding utilization was the absence of financial technology regulation, including the crowdfunding regulation, many investors did not understand about the crowdfunding platform scheme and its risk"
2021-0081,0,"digital financial inclusion (dfi) refers to efforts to make digital financial services available and affordable to all individuals and institutions, regardless of their net expense or institution size and demographic location"
2021-0081,1,"despite the immense benefits of dfi and dfi-based products and services such as mobile money and payment systems, users acceptance is thin, limited, and disappointing in some developing countries as jordan"
2021-0081,2,"consequently, this study has investigated the factors influencing the acceptance of the mobile payment system in the jordanian context"
2021-0081,3,this studys research model synthesizes the technology acceptance model (tam) variables and extended the model with perceived financial cost as an independent variable
2021-0081,4,the research model has been empirically confirmed by fitting the model to data collected from 304 jordanian citizens using a survey instrument
2021-0081,5,the data were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling (pls-sem)
2021-0081,6,the result has confirmed that behavioural intention to use the m-payment system is significantly and positively influenced by perceived usefulness and perceived financial cost
2021-0081,7,behavioural intention to use m-payment system was not found to be significantly and positively influenced by perceived ease of use and hence the related hypothesis was not supported
2021-0081,8,"finally, conclusions and recommendations are further discussed in the last section of this paper"
2021-0123,0,"in the digital era, we witness the increasing use of artificial intelligence (ai) to solve problems, while improving productivity and efficiency"
2021-0123,1,"yet, inevitably costs are involved with delegating power to algorithmically based systems, some of whose workings are opaque and unobservable and thus termed the black box"
2021-0123,2,central to understanding the black box is to acknowledge that the algorithm is not mendaciously undertaking this action
2021-0123,3,it is simply using the recombination afforded to scaled computable machine learning algorithms
2021-0123,4,"but an algorithm with arbitrary precision can easily reconstruct those characteristics and make life-changing decisions, particularly in financial services (credit scoring, risk assessment, etc.), and it could be difficult to reconstruct, if this was done in a fair manner reflecting the values of society"
2021-0123,5,"if we permit ai to make life-changing decisions, what are the opportunity costs, data trade-offs, and implications for social, economic, technical, legal, and environmental systems? we find that over 160 ethical ai principles exist, advocating organisations to act responsibly to avoid causing digital societal harms"
2021-0123,6,"this maelstrom of guidance, none of which is compulsory, serves to confuse, as opposed to guide"
2021-0123,7,"we need to think carefully about how we implement these algorithms, the delegation of decisions and data usage, in the absence of human oversight and ai governance"
2021-0123,8,"the paper seeks to harmonise and align approaches, illustrating the opportunities and threats of ai, while raising awareness of corporate digital responsibility (cdr) as a potential collaborative mechanism to demystify governance complexity and to establish an equitable digital society"
2021-0263,0,financial technology (fintech) has become a disruptive innovation
2021-0263,1,"being one form of fintech financing, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending has been widely developed and has grown rapidly for the last few years"
2021-0263,2,the main challenge for p2p lending is on managing risks
2021-0263,3,fintech with artificial intelligence (ai) can be used as a strategic tool in mitigating risks for fintech companies in assessing creditworthiness of a potential customer
2021-0263,4,"however, ai-enabled assessment has created several ethical issues and dilemmas for the stakeholders in the industry"
2021-0263,5,this paper aims to examine the ethical issues and dilemmas by deploying theories of consequentialism and deontology in assisting an ethical decision-making process
2021-0263,6,an ai-enabled risk assessment will automate processes in understanding potential applicants for p2p lending
2021-0263,7,the automation process can potentially mitigate any ethical shortcomings as well as the negative impacts in mining the potential customers data
2021-0122,0,"banks attempt to invest in emerging financial technology (fintech), such as blockchain, to enhance competitiveness"
2021-0122,1,there is a great deal of literature on the technical and legal aspects of blockchain
2021-0122,2,"however, there is little specific guidance on how banks can apply a holistic model to evaluate the blockchainbased business"
2021-0122,3,this study proposes a hybrid decision model with confidenceweighted fuzzy assessments to address this valuable research topic
2021-0122,4,"supported by a group of seasoned experts, five major blockchainbased business models are evaluated for a domestic bank in taiwan"
2021-0122,5,the key findings contribute to understanding the importance of the involved factors and identifying the ideal business strategy for the bank
2021-0122,6,"the result suggests that the most crucial dimension is policies and regulations, not the technical capability of banks"
2021-0078,0,the purpose of the current study is to investigate the role of the islamic financial system in recovery post-covid-19 and the way fintech can be utilized to combat the economic reverberations created by covid-19
2021-0078,1,the global financial crisis of 2008 has established the credentials of the islamic financial system as a sustainable financial system which can save the long run interests of the average citizens around the world while adding value to the real economy
2021-0078,2,the basic ethical tenets available in the islamic financial system make it more suited and readymade to fight the economic aftershocks of a pandemic like covid-19
2021-0078,3,the basic principles of ethical islamic finance have solid connections to financial stability and corporate social responsibility within the wide-reaching business context
2021-0078,4,with the emergence of financial technology (fintech) it has provided a missing impetus to the islamic financial system to compete on equal ground with its conventional counterpart and prove its mettle
2021-0078,5,the study uses discourse analysis along with the content analysis to extract content and draw a conclusion
2021-0078,6,"the findings of the study indicate that covid-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for the social and open innovation to grow and finance world have turned to open innovation to provide a speedy, timely, reliable, and sustainable solution to the world"
2021-0078,7,the findings of the study provide significant implications for governments and policy makers in efficient application of fintech and innovative islamic financial services to fight the economic consequences of the covid-19 pandemic
2021-0264,0,"the information asymmetry caused by the virtual nature of the internet is a challenge faced by fintech innovation regulation, whereas new media participation makes the information environment more complex"
2021-0264,1,"from the perspective of finding a dynamic balance between innovation and regulation, this study considers reputation adjustment under new media participation, as well as the corresponding selection of an innovation path"
2021-0264,2,it is found that the equilibrium strategy of an excessive innovative fintech platform is directly related to its time preference
2021-0264,3,"for platforms that pay more attention to the current interests, the high-pressure regulatory environment and public opinion supervision can effectively restrain excessive innovation, whereas for platforms that focus on long-term interests, appropriate relaxation of regulatory pressure and public opinion environment can encourage the platform to maintain its reputation by pretending to be compliant"
2021-0265,0,the title of the article should be read as: financial geography i: exploring fintech  maps and concepts
2021-0121,0,"as the global startup ecosystem matures its constituent actors are co-evolving in interrelated ways, producing localised entrepreneurial ecosystems around the world"
2021-0121,1,"the entrepreneurial ecosystem literature has identified the shared attributes of these systems, but understandings of their inner-workings, interconnectedness, and variance across such systems is lacking"
2021-0121,2,"this paper explores the emergence of fintech entrepreneurial ecosystems in london and singapore, finding that a single accelerator actor has played a significant role in driving their emergence out of the existing, broader, entrepreneurial ecosystems"
2021-0121,3,"it argues that while the entrepreneurial ecosystem literature benefits from a conceptualisation of these ecosystems as complex adaptive systems, there must be a consideration of the potential for transformative agency by actors in the evolutionary dynamics of entrepreneurial ecosystems"
2021-0022,0,this article surveys research on the effects of digitalization on access to finance
2021-0022,1,we focus the review on access through fintech
2021-0022,2,"we review the growth of three main fintech technologies, fintech lending (incl"
2021-0022,3,"peer-to-peer lending), crowdfunding and initial coin offerings"
2021-0022,4,we discuss existing evidence on how fintech affects access to finance for firms and investors and consider the regulatory challenges it poses
2021-0022,5,"we incorporate the papers in this special issue, underlining their significant contributions to our understanding of the digitalization of finance and its effects"
2021-0022,6,"finally, we discuss the challenges of research in the digital finance area and propose some new avenues for future research"
2021-0120,0,we document a novel pattern that campaign goal amounts set by entrepreneurs on kickstarter exhibit clear clustering at round numbers
2021-0120,1,"we propose that the round number heuristic, a tendency to adopt round numbers as cognitive shortcuts when facing complicated and uncertain situations, may explain the clustering pattern and predict campaign outcomes"
2021-0120,2,"based on 162,863 campaigns between 2009 and 2017, we find a negative relation between the use of round goal amounts and the likelihood of campaign success"
2021-0120,3,our findings suggest that setting a round number goal conveys useful information about entrepreneur quality that could be used by campaign backers or platforms
2021-0077,0,"with thousands of co-existing and competing platforms, the chinese peer-to-peer (p2p) lending market experienced both high growth and high failure rate"
2021-0077,1,we hand collect unique data for these p2p platforms and investigate the differences in performances and survivals for platforms with and without affiliations with state-owned enterprises (soes)
2021-0077,2,"p2p platforms with soe affiliations have higher trading volumes, attract more investors, and offer lower interest rates"
2021-0077,3,"these platforms also survive significantly better than those without the soe affiliations, especially during market downturns"
2021-0077,4,"using p2p platforms with fake soe affiliations as identification, we show that the soe affiliation itself (not related to the fundamentals) is an important signal for p2p market participants"
2021-0077,5,"these results can be helpful to investors and regulators, especially those from other emerging markets"
2021-0076,0,this paper examines the impact of large-scale alternative data on predicting consumer delinquency
2021-0076,1,"using a proprietary double-blinded test from a traditional lender, we find that the big data credit score predicts an individual's likelihood of defaulting on a loan with 18.4% greater accuracy than the lender's internal score"
2021-0076,2,"moreover, the impact of the big data credit score is more significant when evaluating borrowers without public credit records"
2021-0076,3,we also provide evidence that big data have the potential to correct financial misreporting
2021-0074,0,financial technology will be widespread attention
2021-0074,1,it is growing rapidly
2021-0074,2,"as a result of its continued development, new regulations have already been introduced in this field"
2021-0074,3,"the word ""fintech"" is one such word"
2021-0074,4,financial technology will be used in the field for various activities
2021-0074,5,"usually, these procedures are performed by the company or organization that provides information technology-based service that is requested by using an application"
2021-0074,6,"various other important issues, such as network attack security restrictions and privacy threat accounts, should not be left unattended"
2021-0074,7,"it integrates various state-of-the-art technologies such as mobile, embedded systems, mobile networks, mobile computing, cloud, big data, data analysis technology, and embedded cloud computing, including fintech development"
2021-0074,8,"it is important to embedded finance (ef) for its seamless integration and finance of its customers' business services, just as ride-sharing companies uber and lyft have integrated very successful payments"
2021-0074,9,refers to the provision of services
2021-0074,10,"embedded finance is a financial service on the terms of the customer, from anywhere, anytime"
2021-0074,11,there is no longer a need to visit banks that have access to their money
2021-0074,12,"in some cases, embedded finance (in more specifically embedded banks) eliminates traditional banks"
2021-0266,0,"successful portfolio management requires, in addition to advanced optimization strategies, effective recruitment of specialized financial advisors"
2021-0266,1,hiring the wrong ones can be detrimental to investors' financial goals
2021-0266,2,"in this article, we propose an automated crowdsourcing system to organize cooperation between financial advisors and investors"
2021-0266,3,"without interfering with their private portfolio optimization techniques, we design a recruitment framework that matches financial advisors to investors based on their profiles and features, as well as the previous activities of their peers"
2021-0266,4,"using the database of the crowdsourcing platform, we employ an unsupervised technique to regroup advisors with a high degree of similarities into clusters and, hence, shrink the search space"
2021-0266,5,"afterward, we train a machine learning regression model to predict the matching score that can be achieved if an investor hires a particular advisor"
2021-0266,6,these scores are converted to weights of bipartite graphs to which we apply a double-phased many-to-many maximum weight matching algorithm to determine a suitable investor-advisor combination
2021-0266,7,"in the simulations, we investigate the performance of the proposed recruitment approach and show that, compared with other traditional approaches, higher returns can be reached for both investors and financial advisors"
2021-0072,0,initial coin offerings (icos) represent an innovative and new funding mechanism for new technology ventures
2021-0072,1,"in our comprehensive review of the industry's evolution, we show that despite its short history, there have been dramatic changes and shifts in the number of icos, the amount of money raised, the geographic distribution of icos, and their regulation"
2021-0072,2,this dynamism calls into question current research practices and findings
2021-0072,3,we propose that scholars sort out and differentiate supply of vs
2021-0072,4,"demand for ico funding, taking geography and regulation into account with a global perspective"
2021-0053,0,"in the first of two reports on fintech, i review definitions, roots and taxonomies of fintech, survey studies charting fintech development, and theoretical approaches to fintech"
2021-0053,1,emerging empirical research shows a dynamic growth of fintech characterized by heterogeneity and diversity
2021-0053,2,"ecosystems, financial ecologies, and digital platform economies are the most popular approaches to fintech, and i argue that they can be used fruitfully in combination with more established concepts, such as networks and agglomeration"
2021-0053,3,"overall, i show that fintech research is in a state of flux concerning concepts and empirics, and highlight the potential of geography to tame the beast"
2021-0267,0,this paper reviews the development and assesses the future of peer-to-peer (p2p) lending in china
2021-0267,1,chinese p2p lending has expanded by a factor of 60 over the 4 years from 2013 to 2017
2021-0267,2,"consequently, it is now much greater, both in absolute terms and relative to the size of the economy, than in any other country"
2021-0267,3,"the industry though has been plagued by problematic often fraudulent business models in what was, until 2015, effectively a regulatory vacuum"
2021-0267,4,a strict new regulatory regime is currently being introduced
2021-0267,5,"however, the introduction of the strict new regulatory regime, especially the requirements on capital and registration are substantially reducing the volume of p2p lending"
2021-0267,6,we consider the future of p2p lending concluding it is facing substantial uncertainties
2021-0010,0,the rise of digital technologies enables new manifestations of racialization in financial services with marketplace implications
2021-0010,1,"akin to redlining in the lending market, racialization in the spatial availability of digital technologiesincluding financial technologies or fintechmay raise the costs of banking in black and brown communities"
2021-0010,2,this paper investigates associations between communities' racial makeup and rates of fintech by leveraging 2015 esri business analyst market potential data from the universe of high-poverty zip codes
2021-0010,3,poor black and brown communities experience a form of digital redlining by having the lowest fintech rates
2021-0010,4,"every percentage increase in a community's black population was associated with an 18% decrease in their rate of high-speed internet access, 1% decrease in smartphone ownership, 12% decrease in online banking, and 3% decrease in mobile banking"
2021-0010,5,"relationships were opposite for communities with increasing white populations where whiteness attracts higher rates of fintech, even amidst high poverty"
2021-0031,0,a vast digital ecosystem of entrepreneurship and exchange has sprung up with bitcoins digital infrastructure at its core
2021-0031,1,we explore the worldwide spread of infrastructure necessary to maintain and grow bitcoin as a system (bitcoin nodes) and infrastructure enabling the use of bitcoins for everyday economic transactions (bitcoin merchants)
2021-0031,2,"specifically, we investigate the role of legal, criminal, financial, and social determinants of the adoption of bitcoin infrastructure"
2021-0031,3,"we offer some support for the view that the adoption of cryptocurrency infrastructure is driven by perceived failings of traditional financial systems, in that the spread of bitcoin infrastructure is associated with low trust in banks and the financial system among inhabitants of a region, and with the occurrence of country-level inflation crises"
2021-0031,4,"on the other hand, our findings also suggest that active support for bitcoin is higher in locations with well-developed banking services"
2021-0031,5,"finally, we find support for the view that bitcoin adoption is also partly driven by cryptocurrencies usefulness in engaging in illicit trade"
2021-0268,0,"with the application of big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, block chain and other technological innovations in various financial fields, the integration of finance and technology is becoming a new trend in the future development of the financial industry"
2021-0268,1,"in the background of financial technology development, the course designing of financial engineering is facing many opportunities and challenges"
2021-0268,2,"under the background of integration of the beijing-tianjin-hebei region, colleges and universities are using this opportunity and servicing talent to different areas, and with the development of financial technology, the original financial engineering course system need adjustment and improvement, and under the background of the integration of the beijing-tianjin-hebei region, this article will promote the curriculum reform and the construction of financial engineering course program"
2021-0269,0,the paper analyzes the current trends of fintech companies' development in relation to the quality of digital logistics
2021-0269,1,"by using the data from fintech companies' ceo interviews, we assess the key trends in fintech companies' development over the past 3 years, reveal key technologies used by these companies and their evolution, and state the importance and relevance of digital logistics issues for fintech companies clients' satisfaction"
2021-0269,2,the research indicates that for fintech company client the ease of getting through the service (optimization of information flows) appears to be more important than other characteristics of the offered product
2021-0269,3,"from the theoretical point of view, our research indicates, that besides key growth driving factors, outlined in existing literature, such as strategy, prerequisites for rapid growth, business model choice, international business networks, entrepreneur's characteristics, product development or theoretical frameworks for development, especially within the international market, the quality of digital logistics performance of fintech companies seem to matter"
2021-0270,0,fintech utilizes innovative technology to offer improved monetary administrations and financial solutions
2021-0270,1,according to data from the prediction of autonomous research artificial intelligence (ai) technologies will allow financial institutions to reduce their operational costs by 22% by 2030
2021-0270,2,"throughout this paper, we study how ai and machine learning algorithms can lead to credit card fraud detection"
2021-0270,3,"after making the theoretical approach to the subject, we develop two different methods autoencoder (semi-supervised learning) and logistic regression (supervised learning) for fraud detection with a high level of accuracy"
2021-0270,4,the results obtained with both methods are promising as we were able to predict fraud transactions with 94% certainty
2021-0271,0,"while the growth of fnancial technologies (fintech) is making the fow of money faster, easier, and more secure, such technologies are often unable to serve many countries due to the global political environment"
2021-0271,1,"despite its severe impact, this issue has remained understudied in the hci literature"
2021-0271,2,"we address this gap by presenting our fndings from a three-month-long ethnography with the iranian community in toronto, canada"
2021-0271,3,"we present their struggles in transferring money to and from their home country -a process that entails fnancial loss, fear, uncertainty, and privacy breaches"
2021-0271,4,"we also outline the informal workarounds that allow this community to circumvent these challenges, along with the associated hassles"
2021-0271,5,this paper contributes to broadening the scope of fintech in the hci literature by connecting it with the politics surrounding transnational transactions
2021-0271,6,we discuss the design implications of our fndings and their contribution to the broader interests of hci in mobilities and social justice
2021-0272,0,"this paper conceptualizes creative transactions' - payment for creative work - as a rich site for the study, design and innovation of new fnancial technologies, and special digital monies'"
2021-0272,1,"for most, creative labor remains highly precarious and underfunded and those working in the creative industries frequently rely on diverse forms of funding for their work"
2021-0272,2,"as a case study, we draw on a corpus of 87 break kickstarter' crowdfunding campaigns, where project creators were encouraged to break conventions and rethink what a kickstarter campaign can be"
2021-0272,3,"by studying how these innovative projects broke fundraising conventions and experimented with the transactional attributes of a kickstarter campaign, we show how they reconfgured the payment for creative work, and developed new relations between creators and their audiences"
2021-0272,4,"drawing on these analyses,we derive newideas and opportunities for the design of special digital monies to support novel creative transactions beyond crowdfunding campaigns"
2021-0273,0,"smart donations is a blockchain-based platform that ofers users 'contracts' that donate funds to certain causes in response to real-world events e.g., whenever an earthquake is detected or an activist tweets about refugees"
2021-0273,1,"we designed smart donations with oxfam australia, trialled it for 8-weeks with 86 people, recorded platform analytics and qualitatively analysed questionnaires and interviews about user experiences"
2021-0273,2,"temporal qualities emerge when automation enforces conditions that contributed to participants' awareness of events that are usually unconscious, and senses of immediacy in contributing to crisis response and ongoing involvement in situations far-away while awaiting conditions to be met"
2021-0273,3,"we suggest data driven automation can reveal diverse temporal registers, in real-world phenomena, sociality, morality and everyday life, which contributes to experiencing a 'right time' to donate that is not limited to productivity or efciency"
2021-0273,4,"thus, we recommend a sensitivity to right time in designing for multiple temporalities in fintech more generally"
2021-0274,0,it is well documented that people living with mental health conditions are more likely to experience financial difficulties
2021-0274,1,"when explaining this association, emphasis has often been placed on financial capability, i.e"
2021-0274,2,the capacity of those living with poor mental health to manage their money
2021-0274,3,this paper challenges such capability-based explanations by reporting on a diary study and interviews with 14 people who self-identify as living with a mental health condition
2021-0274,4,"we focused on their experiences of financial technology use, and explored the role technology played in their strategies to minimise the impact of mental health on their economic circumstances"
2021-0274,5,"rather than lacking capability, participants' practices revealed shortcomings of existing financial technologies and how they sought to work around these"
2021-0274,6,"we conclude by providing a set of design directions for technologies that engage those living with poor mental health not as vulnerable targets for financial inclusion, but as full financial citizens"
2021-0275,0,"in recent years, emerging technologies such as blockchain, big data, and artificial intelligence have developed rapidly and been applied in the financial field, which has caused earth-shaking changes in the overall structure of the financial industry and exerted a profound impact on the banking industry in particular"
2021-0275,1,"this paper starts with an overview of financial technology, analyzes the opportunities and challenges faced by the banking industry in the context of financial technology, and makes relevant recommendations on the coordinated development and transformation of the banking industry"
2021-0276,0,"with an innovation to offer in product services in the banking and financial services industry, fintech has received both attention from investors and regulatory bodies across globe"
2021-0276,1,"with a primary objective to improve financial inclusion for unbanked population in emerging economies through mobile devices, fintech have become new commercial entities that promise to deliver millennium goals of world bank and g20 nations"
2021-0276,2,"the availability of huge user data due to use of mobile devices and its use to generate sales of financial products, fintech companies and solutions are constantly changing and are unique to each fintech company"
2021-0276,3,"fintech have devised a business model to provide financial services in the form of payment services, wealth management, crowd funding, lending services, forex services for remittance, digital wallets and digital currencies"
2021-0276,4,"the data driven business model, connected customers over mobile phones and several financial services demand new regulatory framework that also protects consumers and prevents systemic risk in the economy"
2021-0276,5,"in this paper, we have identified the regulatory guidelines issued for various financial product for customers and challenges fintech will need to solve to provide innovative services"
2021-0276,6,"the paper aims to cover the life cycle of products, scope of innovation for fintech and methods to meet requirements by regulatory bodies"
2021-0276,7,this paper covers the requirements by products in 'account services' offered by banking and financial services industry
2021-0119,0,this article focuses on the relationship between fintech and bank risk-taking behavior
2021-0119,1,"since robo-advisor is one of the mature applications of fintech, we found that the development of fintech will have a greater impact on small and medium-sized banks through the establishment of a robo-advisor model"
2021-0119,2,this paper uses a benchmark regression model to analyze the municipal digital financial inclusion index compiled by peking university and the annual report data of 155 small and medium-sized banks from 2011 to 2016
2021-0119,3,we found that the development of fintech has significantly reduced bank risk-taking level
2021-0119,4,this result is still valid after the robustness test of replacing the banks risk-taking index and replacing the fintech development index
2021-0119,5,"we used the urban innovation index as an instrumental variable to deal with the endogenous problem, and obtained consistent estimation results"
2021-0119,6,"the test of the intermediary effect shows that the development of fintech will affect the bank risk-taking through channels such as the banks internal interest margin, management capabilities, the banks external competition intensity, and residents saving willingness"
2021-0119,7,"heterogeneity analysis shows the reduction effect of fintech on bank risk-taking is more pronounced in banks in eastern and western regions in china, the large banks and the urban commercial banks"
2021-0073,0,ending poverty in all its forms by 2030 remains the first agenda of sustainable development goals set by the united nations in 2015
2021-0073,1,"motivated by this agenda, this study examined the direct and indirect effect of financial technology (fintech) and its sub-measures of third-party payment and credit on poverty measured by household per capita consumption"
2021-0073,2,we used a panel of 31 provinces in china from 2011 to 2017
2021-0073,3,the results indicated that fintech and these sub-measures reduce poverty in china
2021-0073,4,the results further showed that fintech complements economic growth and financial development to reduce poverty in china
2021-0277,0,both academic and nonacademic literature is evolving following the oscillating development of artificial intelligence (ai) and computing power's evolution in their application to finance and financial markets
2021-0277,1,"the limits to economic growth encountered after the financial crisis and, successively, the recent pandemic bursts have posed new challenges to ai-related technologies"
2021-0277,2,"the surveyed publications have given hope in harvesting improved efficiency, new data, information, advisory and management services, risk mitigation, and some unanswered questions regarding negative impacts on sustainable growth and increasing economic welfare"
2021-0118,0,the role of digital technostress and self-efficacy in digital marketing research is seldom discussed and even more rarely examined among gen z consumers
2021-0118,1,"this study investigates the relationships between four sub-dimensions of technostress (complexity, overload, invasion, and uncertainty), digital technology self-efficacy, and fintech usage intention"
2021-0118,2,data from a total of 266 chinese gen z consumers were used in multiple regression analysis
2021-0118,3,the results of the study generally support that all sub-dimensions of technostress were negatively related to fintech usage intention
2021-0118,4,"related to the moderating effects of digital technology self-efficacy on the relationship between the four sub-dimensions of technostress and fintech usage intention, significant interaction effects with complexity and overload were found"
2021-0118,5,"finally, the study discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of the research findings"
2021-0140,0,"although fintechs and incumbents are applying artificial intelligence (ai) differently, they both expect that the status-quo will likely be maintained through collaboration rather than competition"
2021-0140,1,both perceive bigtechs as a strategic threat given their ai capabilities and their entrance into financial services
2021-0140,2,incumbents are experimenting with more different kinds of ai than fintechs: fintechs use the technologies for new products and services while incumbents are using them for incremental innovations to existing products and services
2021-0140,3,"the incumbents expect that adopting ai will lead to a loss in jobs of 9% over the next 10 years and, because these companies represent a large percentage of the workforce (median company size surveyed has more than 10,000 employees), this loss in jobs cannot be compensated by the 19% increase in jobs provided by existing fintechs (median company size surveyed has less than 50 employees)"
2021-0140,4,"ai can reduce and increase risk, and most incumbents and fintechs agree that there will be no effect on risk at the organizational level but that there will be an increase in risk at the societal level"
2021-0140,5,"while both fintechs and incumbents agree on the relative importance of legal and human hurdles and consider the biggest hurdle is related to data and regulations concerning data, fintechs perceive these hurdles to be greater than do incumbents"
2021-0028,0,"artificial intelligence (ai) is creating a rush of opportunities in the financial sector, but financial organizations need to be aware of the risks inherent in the use of this technology"
2021-0028,1,"financial organizations are integrating ai in their operations: in-house, outsourced, or ecosystem-based"
2021-0028,2,"the growth of ai-based fintech firms has encouraged several mergers and acquisitions among financial service providers and wealth managers as they grapple with volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity"
2021-0028,3,ai's unique promise of combined cost reduction and increased differentiation makes it generally attractive across the board
2021-0028,4,"however, perhaps other than fraud detection, these benefits depend on the scale of an organization"
2021-0028,5,"risk arises from nonrepresentative data, bias inherent in representative data, choice of algorithms, and human decisions, based on their ai interpretations (and whether humans are involved at all once ai has been unleashed)"
2021-0028,6,risk reduction requires a vigilant division of labour between ai and humans for the foreseeable future
2021-0079,0,"due to the impact of covid-19, it is important now more than ever to analyze the relationship between the improvement in digitization and the flow of remittances in order to fill the void that has come as a result of stay at home and quarantine orders"
2021-0079,1,"using a comprehensive measure of digitization that encompasses the commonly used proxies of financial technology (fintech) and employing a system generalized method of moments (gmm) panel estimation methodology on annual data over the period 20042018, this paper examines the impact of digitization, as a proxy of fintech, on the inflow of remittances for a sample of 34 developed and developing countries"
2021-0079,2,"our analysis provides an interesting case study on brazil, russia, india, china and south africa (brics), known as five emerging markets with a great number of workers out of abroad but below the average level of digital transfers"
2021-0079,3,"using the digital ecosystem development index developed by katz and callorda (2018), the results of the paper uncover a statistically significant nonlinear relationship between the improvement in digitization measures and the inflow of remittances with an exact threshold level"
2021-0079,4,"more specifically, our results indicate that improvement in digitization may initially increase the remittances inflow leading to an increase in the stock of remittances received"
2021-0079,5,"nevertheless, once the digitization index reaches its threshold level further improvement in digitization tends decrease as penetration increases, giving rise to a decline in the rate of remittances inflow"
2021-0079,6,"this result implies that the marginal effect of the digital penetration is larger when at its lower level, before the threshold level"
2021-0079,7,"for countries such as the brics, with a level of digitization below the average of our sample, policy makers should apply more aggressive and comprehensive policies to recoup the maximum gains of a digital ecosystem"
2021-0079,8,"hence, our policy implications are directed towards increasing the investments in developing human capacity including carrying different skill development training programs to prepare individuals for the information age, expanding the internet coverage and speed especially in educational establishments, encouraging the use and access of electronic banking by consumers, producers, and governments, and taking cyber security and fraud protection more seriously to encourage the flow of remittances, especially in light of its renewed utility due to the recent pandemic"
2021-0129,0,research on incubation models indicates that incubators and accelerators are crucial catalysts for the development of start-ups
2021-0129,1,"to facilitate start-ups in financial markets, several regulatory authorities have adopted a new incubation model called a regulatory sandbox"
2021-0129,2,regulatory sandboxes enable eligible applicants to test their technology-enabled financial solutions for a certain period of time (subject to conditions the regulator imposes)
2021-0129,3,"as such, these instruments allow innovation while preventing severe instability in financial markets caused by systemic risk"
2021-0129,4,"despite their importance, management research has devoted little attention to studying how sandboxes operate as a new incubation model"
2021-0129,5,"in our abductive study, we adopt the activity system framework and a qualitative analysis approach to investigate the activities of five leading sandboxes and compare them with the activities of other incubation models"
2021-0129,6,"the data analysis yielded an activity model with three design elements (achieving membership, participating and detaching) and one design theme (improving connectedness)"
2021-0129,7,"thus, sandboxes are characterized by providing regulatory guidance and facilitating access to testing across international jurisdictions, distinguishing them from both generic and specialized incubation models"
2021-0129,8,our primary contribution to the incubation literature is extending the knowledge of a unique incubation model through a set of theoretical propositions
2021-0019,0,blockchain technology has been advocated as a possible solution to enduring trust issues among trading partners in trade finance
2021-0019,1,we conducted in-depth interviews with industry experts to examine how blockchain technology influences the trust relationships among trading partners
2021-0019,2,"our results show that the technology enhances trust relationships by (1) improving the security of transactions and data exchanges, (2) facilitating the expression of benevolence, (3) enhancing the efficiency and the quality of communication, and (4) increasing the predictability of trading partners"
2021-0019,3,the paper concludes with implications for both research and practice
2021-0018,0,"as the impacts of the covid-19 pandemic play out globally, the banking industry has been affected in both positive and negative ways, with the crisis creating both opportunities and threats for the collaborations between fintech and banks"
2021-0018,1,the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of fintech products (ftps) on commercial bank's performance in china
2021-0018,2,required data are collected with a quantitative approach and two self-designed questionnaires were distributed to customers and employees of commercial banks in china
2021-0018,3,the gathered data were examined using the structural equation modeling technique
2021-0018,4,"the results of this study reveal that the perceived usefulness (pu) of ftps has positive and significant impacts on customer satisfaction, low expectation of bank employee assistance, bank's service quality and employee work efficiency"
2021-0018,5,"additionally, the perceived difficulty of use (pd) of ftps has negative and significant impacts on customer satisfaction and low expectation of assistance"
2021-0018,6,"interestingly, there is a positive and significant relationship between pd and banks' service quality and work efficiency, meaning that the service quality and work efficiency can reduce some shortcomings of using ftps"
2021-0018,7,this study recognizes the need to enhance the understanding of ftps on non-financial firm performance
2021-0018,8,this is the first study that helps commercial banks in china understand the perception of ftps from both customer and employee perspectives
2021-0030,0,"in the fourth industrial revolution, the prevalence of innovation and technology in the financial sector is indisputable"
2021-0030,1,"the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of it investments on intellectual capital, aggregated and decomposed into its components, competitive advantage, and the performance of banks (tobin's q and camels)"
2021-0030,2,"these forces are further classified in terms of dual banking, bank size, and market position, and any country-based phenomena that might be applicable"
2021-0030,3,"moreover, data is collected from 65 banks in the saarc region, based on a time span of 11 years, from the years 2008 to 2018, and involving a total of 715 observations"
2021-0030,4,"based on the endogeneity of it investments, this study uses gmm regression for empirical analysis"
2021-0030,5,"the findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate a positive impact of it investments on the intellectual capital, and some sub-components"
2021-0030,6,"in the case of the impact of it investments' on competitive advantage, the results are have come out to be diverse in nature"
2021-0030,7,"from a theoretical perspective, this paper contributes to the existing literature by presenting a valuable analytical framework for exploring the role of it investments in a rapidly changing financial sector"
2021-0141,0,"in this paper we present the impact of alternative data that originates from an app-based marketplace, in contrast to traditional bureau data, upon credit scoring models"
2021-0141,1,these alternative data sources have shown themselves to be immensely powerful in predicting borrower behavior in segments traditionally underserved by banks and financial institutions
2021-0141,2,"our results, validated across two countries, show that these new sources of data are particularly useful for predicting financial behavior in low-wealth and young individuals, who are also the most likely to engage with alternative lenders"
2021-0141,3,"furthermore, using the treeshap method for stochastic gradient boosting interpretation, our results also revealed interesting non-linear trends in the variables originating from the app, which would not normally be available to traditional banks"
2021-0141,4,our results represent an opportunity for technology companies to disrupt traditional banking by correctly identifying alternative data sources and handling this new information properly
2021-0141,5,at the same time alternative data must be carefully validated to overcome regulatory hurdles across diverse jurisdictions
2021-0278,0,"this article proposes a digital banking accelerator-a ""starter kit""for helping traditional banks having little or no service-oriented architecture (soa) competencies to rapidly implement an effective soa to accelerate their digital banking capability"
2021-0279,0,"with the rapid development of big data and cloud computing, the analysis and prediction of user loan repayment behavior has become a research hotspot in the field of financial technology"
2021-0279,1,"the majority of previous studies on such issues have focused on e-commerce platforms and commercial banks, but we innovatively apply the data mining and machine learning methods to the provident fund users"
2021-0279,2,"in addition to the traditional two prediction classes of normal loan repayment and loan overdue, we have also added the early loan repayment class to help the provident fund center better manage asset liquidity"
2021-0279,3,"we proposed a model based on stacking ensemble method, and compared with six individual models: cart decision tree, random forest, adaboost, xgboost, catboost and lightgbm"
2021-0279,4,"after experiments, our stacking model has a good improvement under the classification performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, recall score, f1 score, auc score, and kappa score"
2021-0279,5,"furthermore, we also analyzed the importance of features in the process of training the loan repayment behavior prediction model"
2021-0279,6,"through our stacking model and research analysis, the provident fund centers can reduce loan risks and provide better services to their customers"

2021-0280,2,"the focus is mainly on the kenya-based m-pesa given its success, but also discusses more recent innovations that build on mobile money systems to deliver additional financial services and value"
2021-0280,3,"it is noted that although these innovations exist, they have not given rise to a thriving fintech sector"
2021-0280,4,"the chapter therefore also discusses the constraints to the growth of mobile money and what this implies for the future of mobile money in developing economies, and where the most exciting opportunities for research may be"
2021-0281,0,"this book documents important milestones in the epic journey traversed by the central bank of kenya over the last 50 years, putting into perspective the evolution of central banking globally and within the east african region, and contemplating future prospects and challenges"
2021-0281,1,"the book is timely, mainly because the global financial landscape has shifted"
2021-0281,2,"central bankers have expanded their mandates, beyond the singular focus on inflation and consider economic growth as their other important objective"
2021-0281,3,"financial crises have continued to disrupt the functioning of financial institutions and markets, the most devastating episodes being the global financial crisis, which broke out in 2008 and from which the global financial system has not fully recovered, and the unprecedented challenges posed by the global coronavirus pandemic"
2021-0281,4,"bank regulation has moved from basel i, to basel ii, and somehow migrated to basel iii, although some countries are still at the crossroads"
2021-0281,5,"the book originated from the wide-ranging discussions on central banking, from a symposium to celebrate the 50 year anniversary on 13 september 2016 in nairobi"

2021-0080,0,"open banking (ob) is an emerging business field in the financial sector, which relies on intensive collaboration between banks and non-banking service providers"
2021-0080,1,"however, how to evaluate ob business partners from multiple perspectives for banks is underexplored"
2021-0080,2,"therefore, this study proposed a hybrid decision model with supports from seasoned domain experts"
2021-0080,3,this study also adopts a domestic bank from taiwan and four non-banking service providers to illus-trate the hybrid approach with the confidence-weighted fuzzy assessment technique
2021-0080,4,the proposed model might be the first attempt to explore the ob adoption strategy by the novel approach
2021-0080,5,"however, its limitations are the presumed independent relationship among the factors of this hybrid model"
2021-0080,6,"additionally, the results hinge upon domain experts knowledge"

2021-0299,9,"the national banking system, founded in 1863, envisioned the creation of a uniform medium of exchange in the form of national bank notes, which replaced the preexisting system of state bank note issuance"
2021-0299,10,but the creation of the national banking system soon resulted in the diminished importance of bank notes as a medium of exchange
2021-0299,11,"under the new system, state banks faced a prohibitive tax of 10 percent per year on any notes they issued, and national banks had to maintain collateral at the treasury for their outstanding national bank notes equal to 111 percent of their outstanding notes, and also had to maintain an additional 5 percent in required government-currency (greenback) cash reserves on hand"
2021-0299,12,"that meant that if a bank wanted to make loans, it had to find an alternative to bank notes as a funding source for those loans"

2021-0058,1,"although it may be obvious that replacing humans with machines would increase efficiency, it is not clear whether and how machines can improve human decisions"
2021-0058,2,"we answer this question in the context of crowd lending, in which decisions are traditionally made by a crowd of investors"
2021-0058,3,"using data from prosper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ml algorithm predicts listing default probability more accurately than crowd investors"
2021-0058,4,the improvement of the machine over the crowd predictions is more pronounced for highly risky listings
2021-0058,5,we then use the machine to make investment decisions and find that the machine improves upon investors' decisions and leads to greater welfare for both investors and borrowers simultaneously
2021-0058,6,"when machine prediction is used to select loans, it leads to a higher rate of return for investors and more funding opportunities for borrowers with few alternative funding options"
2021-0058,7,we also find suggestive evidence that the machine is biased in gender and race even when it does not use gender and race information as input
2021-0058,8,"we propose a general and effective ""debiasing"" method that can be applied to any prediction-focused ml applications and demonstrate its use in our context"
2021-0058,9,"we show that the debiased ml algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still improves the crowd's investment decisions in our context"
2021-0058,10,these results indicate that ml can help crowd-lending platforms better fulfill the promise of providing access to financial resources to otherwise underserved individuals and ensure fairness in the allocation of these resources
2021-0303,0,"companies like fidelity, etrade, charles schwab, saxo bank and vanguard have dominated the do it yourself online trading platforms since the mid-1990s.what made these platforms so popular is twofold: lower cost of commissions and accessibility"
2021-0303,1,"in recent years, there has been an influx of new competitors into this space"
2021-0303,2,"in particular, millennial traders are gravitating to more modern platforms on the market like robinhood, acorns and stash, which provide even lower commissions, more functionality and interactivity"
2021-0303,3,"as accessibility, ease and no-fee stock trading are no longer differentiators, but rather barriers to entry, brands need to move beyond functionality"
2021-0303,4,this paper examines how brands need to understand and research what makes a millennial loyal to a financial institution
2021-0060,0,small food businesses have difficulty accessing banks for financing
2021-0060,1,the growth of the sharing economy through financial technology (fintech) makes it possible for small enterprises to receive access for credit
2021-0060,2,"however, not all small business owners want to receive financing from fintech companies"
2021-0060,3,this study aims to analyze factors affecting fintech adoption in small enterprises and its impact on business sustainability
2021-0060,4,the modified utaut 2 model was applied in this study
2021-0060,5,there were 184 small food business owners participating as respondents
2021-0060,6,"to analyze the causal relationship between variables, structural equation modeling (sem) was implemented"
2021-0060,7,"the results of the research found that knowledge, safety perceptions, performance expectations, social influence, facilitation conditions and price values affect fintech adoption by small food business owners"
2021-0060,8,"moreover, fintech adoption influences small food business sustainability"
2021-0060,9,"several important recommendations for researchers, the fintech industry and policy makers are formulated"
2021-0165,0,"in the context of current crises following covid-19 and growing global economic uncertainties, the issues regarding financial transactions with fintech are increasingly apparent"
2021-0165,1,"consequently, in our opinion, the utilization of fintech financial transactions leads to  risk-reduction approach when in contact with other people"
2021-0165,2,"moreover, financial transactions with fintech can save up customers pecuniary funds"
2021-0165,3,"therefore, during crises, fintech applications can be perceived as more competitive than the traditional banking system"
2021-0165,4,all the above have provoked us to conduct research related to the utilization of financial transactions with fintech before and after the covid-19 crisis outbreak
2021-0165,5,the aim of the article is to present a survey analysis of fintech utilization of individual customers before and after the crisis in bulgaria
2021-0165,6,the methodology includes a questionnaire survey of 242 individual respondents
2021-0165,7,"for the data processing, we implemented statistical measures and quantitative methods, including two-sample paired t-tests, levenes test, and anovas performed through the computer language python in a web-based interactive computing environment for creating documents, jupyter notebook"
2021-0165,8,the findings bring out the main issues related to the implementation of financial transactions with fintech under the conditions of the crisis

2021-0304,0,"financial technology, or fintech, represents an emerging industry on the global market"
2021-0304,1,"with online transactions on the rise, the use of it for automation of financial services is of increasing importance"
2021-0304,2,fintech enables institutions to deliver services to customers worldwide on a 24/7 basis
2021-0304,3,its services are often easy to access and enable customers to perform transactions in real-time
2021-0304,4,"in fact, advantages such as these make fintech increasingly popular among clients"
2021-0304,5,"however, since fintech transactions are made up of information, ensuring security becomes a critical issue"
2021-0304,6,"vulnerabilities in such systems leave them exposed to fraudulent acts, which cause severe damage to clients and providers alike"
2021-0304,7,"for this reason, techniques from the area of machine learning (ml) are applied to identify anomalies in fintech applications"
2021-0304,8,they target suspicious activity in financial datasets and generate models in order to anticipate future frauds
2021-0304,9,we contribute to this important issue and provide an evaluation on anomaly detection methods for this matter
2021-0304,10,"experiments were conducted on several fraudulent datasets from real-world and synthetic databases, respectively"
2021-0304,11,the obtained results confirm that ml methods contribute to fraud detection with varying success
2021-0304,12,"therefore, we discuss the effectiveness of the individual methods with regard to the detection rate"
2021-0304,13,"in addition, we provide an analysis on the influence of selected features on their performance"
2021-0304,14,"finally, we discuss the impact of the observed results for the security of fintech applications in the future"

2021-0164,1,"however, detailed empirical evidence concerning the impact of various fintech-level and ecosystem-specific factors as determinants of fintech success and survival is yet to be discussed"
2021-0164,2,this paper investigates the underlying factors influencing the success of uae-based fintech ventures
2021-0164,3,"several factors are included in the analysis, controlling for the hedonics of the fintech, including the business model, availability of and access to finance, and business ecosystem framework"
2021-0164,4,data are pooled using a semi-structured questionnaire conducted with 32 fintech founders
2021-0164,5,a qualitative analysis with an ordered logistic regression model was performed
2021-0164,6,"the findings suggest that the availability of resources, in particular through venture capital, is vital to the success and survival of fintechs as microbusinesses"
2021-0164,7,"however, financial barriers, the regulatory environment, and legal issues have a detrimental impact on facilitating the creation and growth of fintech ventures"
2021-0164,8,"furthermore, the business model dimensions product/service offering and value proposition tend to influence the success of these ventures"
2021-0164,9,the empirical models findings will serve as a data-driven tool to help guide finance policymakers in their decisions on how to promote this new sector
2021-0040,0,the fintech industry is gradually maturing and offers a wide range of financial services on the global stage
2021-0040,1,"still, the understanding of fintech business models remains at its infancy with a shortage of cross-country comparisons"
2021-0040,2,this paper aims to determine the differences in business model attributes of fintechs in five rapidly emerging fintech hotspots in central and eastern europe (cee)
2021-0040,3,"survey results from estonia, latvia, lithuania, poland, and russia, accompanied by cluster analysis, enable us to provide unique in-depth evidence on fintech business models"
2021-0040,4,"across the selected countries, we observe significant differences in the attributes of fintech business models: key activities, key resources, value propositions, customer segments, delivery channels, cost structure, and revenue stream"
2021-0040,5,"we identify four clusters of fintechs: lending community, mixed services, payment service, and payment community"
2021-0040,6,"although these clusters share similarities with fintech archetypes proposed in previous research, they remain rather unevenly distributed across countries"
2021-0042,0,clean and modern energy is still inaccessible for large sections of rural populations globally with sub-saharan africa being the largest
2021-0042,1,rising population and unfolding climate change only compound this problem
2021-0042,2,"however, sub-saharan countries  especially ones with large populations and economies  must find avenues to sustainably finance renewable energy development, including in otherwise ignored rural areas where climate vulnerability is disproportionately high"
2021-0042,3,"here we argue that small-scale renewable energy financing from multilateral financial institutions (mfis), banks and government has been long neglected and combining the inherent strengths of community based organisations (cbos) with technology can help improve access to small-scale renewable energy finance in rural sub-saharan africa"

2021-0305,2,"using the 2017 survey of household economics and decision-making (shed) (n = 11,359), we examine the relationship between saving behavior related to emergency, long-term and periodic expenses and personal, technological, and hybrid bank account access methods"
2021-0305,3,binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of reporting various saving behaviors in relation to various banking access methods
2021-0305,4,"findings suggest that the personal access method is positively associated with savings behavior for periodic expenses for the general population, and negatively associated with emergency savings in people with lower education attainment"
2021-0305,5,"technology is associated with all types of saving behavior, while the hybrid access method is associated only with saving for periodic expenses"
2021-0305,6,"as investments in self-service technology increase, the importance of access methods to savings behavior must be considered"

2021-0069,0,this is the first paper that explores lottery-like demand in cryptocurrency markets
2021-0069,1,"since recent research provides evidence that cryptocurrency returns appear to be short-memory processes, we modify bali, cakici and whitelaw's (2011) and bali, brown, murray, and tang's (2017) max measure and employ a weekly forecast horizon and daily log-returns from the previous week to calculate the metric for our portfolio sorts"
2021-0069,2,"from an econometric point of view, this study proposes statistical tests that are robust to unknown dynamic dependency structures in the cryptocurrency data"
2021-0069,3,our results show that average raw and risk-adjusted return differences between cryptocurrencies in the lowest and highest max quintiles exceed 1.50% per week
2021-0069,4,these results are robust after controlling for bitcoin risk or potential microstructure effects
2021-0069,5,"our findings are important also from a theoretical point of view because they suggest that parallel to stock markets, similar behavioral mechanisms of underlying investor behavior are present also in new virtual currency markets"
2021-0075,0,this research examines individuals feasibility of adopting digital wallet also known as ewallet
2021-0075,1,it aims at assessing the technological readiness among customers especially youth by measuring the acceptance level of digital wallet adoption in a massive implementation of the digital economy
2021-0075,2,adoption of ewallet can potentially enhance the efficiency of financial institutions and the provision of new services for the convenience of the customers
2021-0075,3,the nature of this study was developed in the context of south east asia focusing on brunei darussalam
2021-0075,4,"the study using a framework for assessment based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model revealed that the main construct of the model to be predictors of behavioral intention, was attitude towards using technology and anxiety"
2021-0075,5,"these results might be as a result of the millennial generation being in constant interaction with various types of technology, paired with the rising internet connectivity leading to the minimal impact of the digital wallet adoption"
2021-0035,0,we conduct a detailed analysis of investors in successful initial coin offerings (icos)
2021-0035,1,the average ico has 4700 contributors
2021-0035,2,the median participant contributes small amounts and many investors sell their tokens before the underlying product is developed
2021-0035,3,large presale investors obtain tokens at a discount and flip part of their allocation shortly after the ico
2021-0035,4,ico contributors lack the protections traditionally afforded to investors in early-stage financing
2021-0035,5,"nevertheless, returns 9 months after the ico are positive on average, driven mostly by an increase in the value of the ethereum cryptocurrency"
2021-0306,0,"in this research, we communicate the design and evaluation of a consumer financial goals ontology to be utilized as a knowledgebase within recommender systems applications designed to provide decision support in the domain of financial planning"
2021-0306,1,the goal of this research is to provide a domain conceptualization and knowledge classification of a comprehensive set of financial capability enhancing objectives contextually appropriate for a wide range of socio-economically situated consumers
2021-0306,2,"currently, to the best of our knowledge, within the domain of consumer financial planning no formal conceptual model or knowledge classification of financial goals exists which might be utilized as a knowledgebase for applications such as a fintech recommender system"
2021-0306,3,"achieving financial goals is a key behavior associated with consumer financial capability, a topic of national economic importance"
2021-0306,4,a holistic representation of domain concepts is critical for advancement of solutions to problems pertinent to a domain
2021-0306,5,one primary reason for the dearth of applications designed to assist consumers with financial goal setting is the absence of a common domain ontology of financial goals
2021-0306,6,this study addresses a gap in the literature by contributing to the research knowledgebase an ontology for a domain of consumer financial goals
2021-0306,7,"in doing so, it advances scholarly research through novel domain knowledge classification while providing researchers and practitioners with an ontological knowledgebase for indexing and retrieval within applications designed to improve consumer financial capability through identification and recommendation of specific, context-aware financial goals"
2021-0306,8,"the ontology could be used, for example, as a knowledgebase for a personal financial recommender system (pfrs), or other financial technology (fintech) application, designed to assist users with identification, setting, and tracking of financial goals"
2021-0006,0,this study examines the impact of financial technology (fintech) on the ability of banks to offer credit to small and medium enterprises (smes)
2021-0006,1,"by analyzing the lending records of banks in chinese provinces from 2011 to 2018, we demonstrate that fintech effectively facilitates the banking sector's credit supply to smes"
2021-0006,2,we also consider whether the impact of fintech varies according to the size of the bank
2021-0006,3,"compared with small banks, fintech has a more significant influence on the increase in credit for smes in large banks"
2021-0006,4,"thus, maybe it is more important to utilize fintech than to develop many small banks"

2021-0098,2,"based on the 1230 daily returns of fintech index ranges from july 2, 2014, to september 10, 2019, the empirical results indicate that the fintech industry possesses a higher risk, and is affected by both the past development and internal macroeconomic condition"
2021-0093,0,there has been a substantial build-up of non-performing assets in the indian banking sector
2021-0093,1,"despite multiple initiatives and regulatory changes, there is a need to revisit the reporting and regulatory frameworks and redefine the focus areas"
2021-0093,2,banks credit problem has often been explored under the lens of asymmetric information
2021-0093,3,spreads are generally directly proportional to probability of default and an inverse function of collateral and security
2021-0093,4,"however, in india, there is a noticeable gap in academic literature to suggest robust institutional reforms to address the twin curse of adverse selection and moral hazard"
2021-0093,5,"regulatory frameworks, particularly with respect to risk management function of banks, also grapple with predicting forthcoming disruptions"
2021-0093,6,"as banks redesign their corporate customer experience on a digitalized scale, leveraging large-scale available data, there is a bigger challenge to the regulator to ensure risk regulations are effective and save costs as well"
2021-0093,7,"the authors suggest that if information asymmetry exists, the blockchain protocols may mitigate uncertainty"
2021-0093,8,"though blockchain technology has been leveraged to increase effectiveness of certain corporate banking products, the originality of the paper lies in coming out with a detailed framework for the possible use of blockchain (a distributed ledger based technology) for credit decisions, timely generation of red-flags and tightening the regulatory framework"
2021-0093,9,the paper also lists down suggestions to improve the enabling regulatory and reporting architecture using regulatory technology (regtech) to support unification of data already available in the banking system
2021-0093,10,"this will improve the quality of information available to the lenders and enable them to take more informed credit decisions (data-driven finance), while granting and monitoring loans"
2021-0093,11,"ultimately, it will lead to an optimization of credit risk capital"
2021-0307,0,at present the phenomena what is happening is on the use of financial technology in particular with regard to digital payments

2021-0307,4,the current research design is based on survey data collected from 200 respondents from all generations who have used a digital wallet based application
2021-0307,5,the data analysis procedure uses structural equation modeling with pls
2021-0307,6,"the research findings show that performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation and trust influence behavioral intention of digital wallets and effort expectancy does not affect the behavioral intention of a digital wallet"
2021-0307,7,while behavioral intention has a positive effect on the use of behavior of digital wallets
2021-0307,8,this paper tries to shed new light on the use of application-based digital wallets for all generations
2021-0307,9,"in addition, this model needs to be extended to the external factors of the user and consider the location of each user, in the context of this study the use of an application-based digital wallet is more often used for culinary shopping"
2021-0308,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of social disclosure on loan funding and repayment within the fixed-rate peer-to-peer (p2p) lending model
2021-0308,1,"design/methodology/approach: by analyzing 31,637 loans from the largest p2p lending company in the usa, the authors study the effects of different forms of social disclosures and the specific contents of such disclosures on the speed of funding, amount borrowed, recovered principal amount and loan default"
2021-0308,2,findings: some social disclosures help to fund a loan and are positively associated with loan repayment
2021-0308,3,the findings reveal prescriptive ways p2p borrowers indicate creditworthiness through social disclosure on loan listings
2021-0308,4,practical implications: the results suggest that it is advantageous for p2p borrowers to invest time into well-written loan descriptions and remain engaged with potential lenders
2021-0308,5,originality/value: the authors show that some social disclosure factors that affect funding time and likelihood do not necessarily affect the loan default and repayment in the same way

2021-0033,10,our intent is to provide a primer for those of us in the latter two fields so that we can embrace the rapidly changing built environment landscape as it adjusts and adapts to a post covid-19 environment that will be critical to maintain real estate investment values and enhance the real estate user's experience
2021-0310,0,financial technology intelligent intrusion detection system based on the financial data feature extraction and dnns is designed and implemented in this paper
2021-0310,1,highlights of the paper are focused on the following aspects
2021-0310,2,"(1) we propose the automatic generation method of the multi-dimensional variation of the test data, and define different data generation rules for different protocol field types by referring to the attack mode of common vulnerabilities"
2021-0310,3,the novel dnns framework is designed for the analysis of the system
2021-0310,4,"(2) the upgrading of the financial technology in the general terminal interface technology, big data analysis, cloud computing and various data collection methods makes it easier for data, we use the collected data to ensure the further processing framework"
2021-0310,5,the simulation results compared with the state-of-the-art models have proven effectiveness
2021-0039,0,this paper assesses the variables influencing the expansion of cryptocurrency (crypto for short) use in households
2021-0039,1,to carry on the study we apply a consumer-behavior focus and so-called fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca)
2021-0039,2,"in a previous research, that was grounded on unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) and partial least squares (pls), we found that main factors to explain the intention to use of cryptos by individuals were performance expectancy (in fact, it was the main factor), effort expectancy and facilitating conditions"
2021-0039,3,"we did not found evidences about the relevance of social influence, perceived risk and financial literacy"
2021-0039,4,this study revisits these results by applying fsqca instead pls
2021-0039,5,"empirical research on factors influencing cryto use is relatively scarce due to the novelty of blockchain techs, so the present paper expands the literature on this topic by using an original analytical tool in this context"
2021-0039,6,the main contribution of this paper consists in showing empirically that fsqca provides a complementary and enriching perspective to interpret data about the use of cryptos
2021-0039,7,we obtain again that the most relevant factor to explain the intention of using cryptocurrencies is perceived expectancy and that also effort expectancy and facilitation conditions are relevant
2021-0039,8,"but also fsqca has allowed us discovering that despite social influence, perceived risk and financial literacy were not significant in the pls model, they impact on the intention to use cryptocurrencies when are combined with other factors"
2021-0039,9,social influence acts as an enable factor for the rest of explanatory variables and it is linked positively with intention to use cryptos
2021-0039,10,also financial literacy is relevant because its lack is a sufficient condition for the non-acceptance of that blockchain tech
2021-0039,11,likewise we have checked that perceived risk influences the intention of using cryptos
2021-0039,12,"however, this influence may be positive or negative depending of the circumstances"
2021-0311,0,"fee-based buy-now-pay-later services (bnpl) are becoming widely adopted in many developed countries, including australia"
2021-0311,1,across a variety of regulatory approaches there appears to be relatively minimal regulatory coverage of fee-based bnpl
2021-0311,2,"this review applies a results-ori-ented, behaviourally informed market failure approach to assess the regulatory outcomes of fee-based bnpl"
2021-0311,3,the review makes the case that the impacts of the regulation of fee-based bnpl in australia demonstrate multiple forms of regulatory failure
2021-0311,4,the regulatory failure is particularly due to regulatory capture at a broad level and especially in terms of a lack of consumer protections
2021-0311,5,consumers may particularly need consideration and protection because understanding the increasing complexity and financial knowledge at the heart of many fintech services is beyond the capabil-ity or responsibility of the consumer
2021-0311,6,incorporating social and consumer considerations into analyses of regulatory structures can enable analyses of the regulation of fintech and move financial services regulation toward providing more socially useful and sustainable financial services
2021-0311,7,"in the future, a behaviourally informed approach to the regulation of fintech may be beneficial and en-hance sustainability"
2021-0312,0,"based on the data of peer-to-peer (p2p) platforms, employing the arimax model and analyzing the risk outbreak process of p2p platforms, we find that the risk outbreak of p2p is a spreading process from weak to strong along the qualification chain of the platforms"
2021-0312,1,this risk outbreak process along the qualification chain is dubbed the fuze effect in this paper as the process is similar to that of the fuze detonating explosives
2021-0312,2,"this finding implies that the real risk comes from the uneven quality of p2p platforms, which is different from the dominant opinion that of their credit enhancement services"
2021-0312,3,our further study suggests that the fuze effect comes from deadweight cost caused by market competition
2021-0312,4,this study is of significance for risk prevention in emerging industries such as fintech
2021-0312,5,"that is, for the sake of sustainable development of emerging industries, the government must be vigilant about the fuze effect"
2021-0313,0,"currently, there are a great number of platform-projects and frameworks based on blockchain technology"
2021-0313,1,"consequently, it is necessary to define the most relevant blockchain platforms and analyze them taking into consideration a variety of features"
2021-0313,2,"also, there is a need to investigate the logistics growth and the price of bitcoin on the binance cryptocurrency exchange"
2021-0313,3,the authors have examined modern technologies used by manufacturing companies in the field of fintech in the context of the 2019-2024 period
2021-0313,4,the results show that sensors and automatic identification take the leading position both at present and in 2024
2021-0313,5,"artificial intelligence and blockchain are also in demand by manufacturers today, however in the nearest future their ranking positions will increase sixfold from 10% to 60%"
2021-0313,6,in the current paper the authors review the largest companies that effectively use blockchain technology in their businesses
2021-0313,7,the conducted survey shows that 18% of companies use blockchain technology based on bitcoin
2021-0313,8,the authors have analysed a number of bitcoin transactions for the period from january 2017 to february 2021 and concluded that the covid-19 pandemic has had a favourable effect on the indicator data
2021-0313,9,a maximum number of transactions equal to 10.15 million was carried out in july 2020
2021-0313,10,using the method of the ordinary least squares (ols) and statistical estimation methods the authors have revealed an underestimation of the equilibrium state of the empirical distribution of price data and the volume of daily trading of bitcoin on the binance cryptocurrency exchange through the channel of the right-hand confidence interval
2021-0313,11,the blockchain technology based on bitcoin has positively reacted to the macroeconomic factors such as the covid-19 pandemics and further growth in bitcoin transactions is expected
2021-0313,12,"with the help of economic modelling, the authors have defined the predictable volume and the price of bitcoin on the binance cryptocurrency exchange"
2021-0314,0,"in recent years, traditional banking has experienced a series of changes due to the arrival of new competitors, which through a new business model called fintech denoting financial technology, has revolutionized the offer of financial products and services"
2021-0314,1,"these changes motivated the development of this research, with the aim of identifying what this new model consists of and its main impacts"
2021-0314,2,"to achieve this, a systematic literature review was carried out on the most relevant publications in the last 5 years, as a result of which it was found that the main impacts were the digitization of products and services, followed by changes in the business model of financial institutions"
2021-0314,3,"furthermore, it was identified that taking advantage of opportunities and reaction to threats will be the differentiator for traditional banks to ensure their permanence in the market"
2021-0315,0,"smart beta strategies across economic regimes seek to address inefficiencies created by market-based indices, thereby enhancing portfolio returns above traditional benchmarks"
2021-0315,1,our goal is to develop a strategy for re-hedging smart beta portfolios that shows the connection between multifactor strategies and macroeconomic variables
2021-0315,2,"this is done, first, by analyzing finite correlations between the portfolio weights and macroeconomic variables and, more remarkably, by defining an investment tilting variable"
2021-0315,3,the latter is analyzed with a discriminant analysis approach with a twofold application
2021-0315,4,the first is the selection of the crucial re-hedging thresholds which generate a strong connection between factors and macroeconomic variables
2021-0315,5,the second is forecasting portfolio dynamics (gain and loss)
2021-0315,6,the capability of forecasting is even more evident in the covid-19 period
2021-0315,7,"analysis is carried out on the ishares us exchange traded fund (etf) market using monthly data in the period december 2013may 2020, thereby highlighting the impact of covid-19"
2021-0048,0,this paper examines the role of cross-listings in the digital token marketplace ecosystem
2021-0048,1,"using a unique set of publicly available and hand-collected data from 3625 tokens traded in 108 marketplaces, we find significant increases in price, trading volume, network growth and on-chain activity around the date of a token's first cross-listing"
2021-0048,2,tokens earn a 16% crypto-market adjusted return in the two weeks around the cross-listing date
2021-0048,3,daily network growth triples on the day of cross-listing
2021-0048,4,"using the uniquely heterogeneous characteristics of token marketplaces, we identify specific value-creation channels"
2021-0048,5,we provide the first evidence supporting value creation through network externalities proposed by recent token-valuation models
2021-0048,6,"consistent with equity cross-listing theory, we find higher returns for cross-listings that reduce market segmentation and improve information production"
2021-0048,7,our reported findings have significant policy implications in terms of more transparent regulations to reduce financial misconduct in the digital marketplace
2021-0099,0,"the article aims to show the opportunities for the formation of new fintech startups in poland and further development of the sector, as well as to identify the most critical threats"
2021-0099,1,the study offers the descriptive and deductive analysis based on the literature review
2021-0099,2,the empirical part relies on the data from external databases as well as the dataset collected in a survey run among the fintechs in poland in january 2020
2021-0099,3,"the paper reveals that poland is a fast-growing fintech market which satisfies various requirements such as the number of secure internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, the available labor force, as well as growing tertiary education enrolment"
2021-0099,4,the crucial obstacles to the development of the sector is the uncertainty about the availability of skilled workers in the future and the lack of proper legal regulations
2021-0046,0,"nowadays, we mainly depend on financial consultants or advisors to conduct risk assess-ments for individual investors before providing them with any investment advice or recommenda-tions"
2021-0046,1,individual investors should understand the risk level of their investment choices and their investment decisions should match their risk profile
2021-0046,2,this process is usually conducted in face-to-face meetings
2021-0046,3,"however, during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which has seriously impacted daily life with social distancing, in order to maintain sustainability, contact-free advising, such as robo-advising, becomes more important"
2021-0046,4,"the aim of this paper was to assess customers risk in regards to investment and identify important risk factors needed to profile individual risk preferences, in order to prepare for robo-advising"
2021-0046,5,"inductive content analysis is applied to classify 180 questions from 20 risk assessment questionnaires, sourced from banks and investment service providers, into different types"
2021-0046,6,"then, the number of types is reduced by collapsing similar areas into broader higher order categories (the important risk factors)"
2021-0046,7,this paper also makes specific recommendations for the implementation of risk profiling in robo-advising
2021-0045,0,one of the major beneficiaries of the fourth industrial revolution is fintech
2021-0045,1,"however, despite the unprecedented growth of, investment in, and returns generated by this sector, a conducive environment and fintech support ecosystem is essential to exploit the true potential of fintech"
2021-0045,2,"the biggest challenge for many governments across the globe is not only setting priorities in which fintech services to invest (e.g., digital wallets, peer-to-peer lending, e-insurances) but also in which geographical area to invest"
2021-0045,3,"since technology is independent of physical interaction and geographical confinement, governments face a dilemma: keep fintech growth geographically diverse or concentrated within a few cities"
2021-0045,4,this study evaluates the fintech success of countries with its spread in different cities and attempts to formulate a policy direction to accelerate the wave of the fourth industrial revolution
2021-0045,5,"our results suggest that rather than a widespread presence, countries should concentrate their efforts, investment, and attention to developing a fintech ecosystem in fewer cities to facilitate them as much as possible"
2021-0045,6,this concentrated effort could help countries improve their global fintech scores and specialize in specific core areas
2021-0017,0,small and medium enterprises (smes) play a vital role in an economy
2021-0017,1,"therefore, it is important to study the avenues that contribute towards their viability"
2021-0017,2,"as a result, we examine the impact of financial technologies (fintechs) on sme efficiency"
2021-0017,3,"using the generalized method of moments methodology and 1,617 sme firms from 22 oecd countries during the period 20112018, we find that fintechs are positively associated with sme efficiency"
2021-0017,4,interesting results emerge when we incorporate culture
2021-0017,5,masculine societies positively moderate the link between fintechs and sme efficiency
2021-0017,6,we also find that individualistic and long-term oriented cultures negatively affect the association between fintechs and sme efficiency
2021-0017,7,our findings have multiple implications
2021-0017,8,this study suggests the need for countries to introduce policies supporting fintech startups in order to improve sme efficiency
2021-0017,9,"moreover, if the sme managers aim to achieve higher firm efficiency, then adopting fintechs may act as a mechanism to attain this objective"
2021-0017,10,"further, it may be important to consider both fintechs and culture when evaluating cross-border investments"
2021-0316,0,"covid-19 pandemic has brought us to a new norm that spawn the world towards new way of working, communicating, and doing business"
2021-0316,1,the evolution of globalization and digital technology with a rapid speed has position fintech as one of the important innovations that would support millions of smes in the current economic situation
2021-0316,2,"based on the contribution and raising number of smes across the world, this paper illustrates the technical and managerial challenges of smes that lie ahead upon the emergence of fintech"
2021-0316,3,the finding is meant to create an awareness towards the potentials of innovative fintech platforms in solving financial issues of smes
2021-0316,4,"however, there is a need for substantial further research and development which should include ongoing assessments on emerging fintech innovation"
2021-0317,0,"financial technology (fintech), including a series of advanced technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence and block-chain, has been gradually applied to various industries after years of development and will become the major driver of the future financial industry"
2021-0317,1,"as one of the largest financial markets in the world, the traditional foreign exchange service industry is gradually entering the era of fintech, bringing new vitality to the foreign exchange market through advanced technology and improving the efficiency of foreign exchange management"
2021-0317,2,"however, while enjoying the opportunities brought by fintech to the foreign exchange field, practitioners in both fintech and the foreign exchange industry should also actively face the challenges and try to build a safe and efficient foreign exchange market environment"
2021-0004,0,"following the operational paradigms proposed by industry 4.0, the last years have been characterized by the rapid growth of technology-based firms increasingly adopting sustainable business models"
2021-0004,1,"in particular, an increasing number of fintech enterprises have started to launch new services in order to avoid the organizational barriers that impact negatively on the voluntary adoption of sustainable business models by smes"
2021-0004,2,"however, research is still scarce in systematizing the efforts and identifying the facilitating factors for such a transition"
2021-0004,3,"drawing on a diverse set of companies, case studies linking fintech application and circular economy (ce) in diverse industries and contexts are analyzed and discussed"
2021-0004,4,"the findings of the qualitative analysis suggest that fintech, an example of sectors developed under the influence of industry 4.0, can play a relevant role in the transition of smes toward a more sustainable business model leading to better integration of circular economy practices"
2021-0004,5,a conceptual framework using the resolve model is then presented with relevant implications for both research and practice
2021-0318,0,"purpose: this paper aims to examine the risks associated with smart contracts, a disruptive financial technology (fintech) innovation, and assesses how in the future they could threaten the integrity of the global financial system"
2021-0318,1,"design/methodology/approach: a qualitative approach is used to identify risk factors related to the use of new financial innovations, by examining how over-the-counter (otc) derivatives contributed to the global financial crisis (gfc) which occurred during 2007 and 2008"
2021-0318,2,"based on this analysis, the potential for similar concerns with smart contracts are evaluated, drawing on the failure of the dao on the ethereum blockchain, which involved the loss of over $60m of digital currency"
2021-0318,3,"findings: extensive use of bilateral agreements, complexity and lack of standardization, lack of transparency, misuse and speed of contagion were factors that contributed to the gfc that could also become material concerns for smart contract technology as its adoption grows"
2021-0318,4,"these concerns, combined with other contextual factors, such as the risk of defects in smart contracts and cyberattacks, could lead to potential destabilization of the broader financial system"
2021-0318,5,"practical implications: the papers findings provide insights to help make the design, management and monitoring of smart contract technology more robust"
2021-0318,6,they also provide guidance for key stakeholders on proactive steps that can be taken with smart contract technology to avoid repeating the types of oversights that contributed to the gfc
2021-0318,7,originality/value: this paper draws attention to the risks associated with the adoption of disruptive fintech

2021-0163,0,purpose: this paper aims to examine whether high levels of financial inclusion is associated with greater financial risk
2021-0163,1,design/methodology/approach: the study uses regression methodology to estimate the effect of financial inclusion on financial risk
2021-0163,2,"findings: the findings reveal that higher account ownership is associated with greater financial risk through high non-performing loans and high-cost inefficiency in the financial sector of developed countries, advanced countries and transition economies"
2021-0163,3,"increased use of debit cards, credit cards and digital finance products reduced risk in the financial sector of advanced countries and developed countries but not for transition economies and developing countries"
2021-0163,4,the findings also show that the combined use of digital finance products with increased formal account ownership improves financial sector efficiency in developing countries while the combined use of credit cards with increased formal account ownership reduces insolvency risk and improves financial sector efficiency in developing countries
2021-0163,5,research limitations/implications: the paper offers several implications for policy and financial regulation
2021-0163,6,it suggests policies that would reduce the financial risk that financial inclusion poses to the financial sector
2021-0163,7,originality/value: the recent interest in financial inclusion and the unintended consequences of policy-driven financial inclusion in some parts of the world is raising concern about the risks that financial inclusion may introduce to the formal financial sector
2021-0163,8,little is known about the risks that financial inclusion may pose to the financial sector
2021-0320,0,[no abstract available
2021-0162,0,"our contribution lies on an alternative axis of research, as yet scarcely investigated, focusing on the question of the rehumanization/dehumanization that would result from the digital offer of financial services"
2021-0162,1,"through four original case studies (china, vietnam, europe and the united states), we found that the automation of routines by fintechs, generating economies of both scale and transaction costs, allowed operators (banks, bigtech, telecom, mfis) to capture this additional value in various forms"
2021-0162,2,"among these, our results suggest that the time freed up from bureaucratic formalities by the institutions employees can be reallocated to customer relations and the personalization of the services offered"
2021-0162,3,"we conclude that this additional value can contribute to foster, in a paradoxical way, human interactions (and therefore rehumanization) within these business relationships"
2021-0321,0,"fintech, which means the combination of finance and technology, is becoming increasingly popular in the world"

2021-0043,5,"for the analysis, the structural equation modeling (sem) was used"
2021-0043,6,the study revealed novel results in predicting covid-19 spread
2021-0043,7,"these three variables (fintech behavior before covid-19, fintech behavior after covid-19, and fintech perception after covid-19) could predict 52.5% of the variance in the dependent variable (covid-19 spread) (r2 = 0.525, p &lt"
2021-0043,8,0.05)
2021-0043,9,the findings show that higher fintech perception and behavior among fintech users will help in reducing the spread of covid-19 by avoiding the use of contact payment methods
2021-0043,10,contactless payment methods are the main tools in fintech that might help in avoiding the probability of covid-19 spread
2021-0043,11,"consumers' fintech perceptions and behavior are the most influencing factors that could predict the spread of covid-19 in this study, where digital payments are the main concern"
2021-0043,12,"it is recommended that consumers adopt digital payment methods and tools, especially contactless payment methods, to fulfill their financial services"
2021-0043,13,other researchers are also encouraged to use the same model to predict the spread of this virus in the fintech context
2021-0322,0,purpose: fintech is an untilled field in which the relation between fintechs and incumbents is yet to be understood
2021-0322,1,this paper aims to explore this relationship and advance its theoretical and practical understanding
2021-0322,2,it further contributes toward fintech paradigm and research domain emergence that both to date remain yet elusive
2021-0322,3,design/methodology/approach: this paper adopted a multiple-case study strategy for the purpose of theory building
2021-0322,4,"seven players from the fintech ecosystem in quebec (canada) were selected, representing financial institutions, fintech start-ups and quebecs financial cluster"
2021-0322,5,"primary data was collected via in-depth interviews with ten respondents at the level of vice presidents, managers, directors, chief executive officers and founders, and unobtrusive data  in the form of running records, mass-media news reports, presentations and proceedings from fintech events"
2021-0322,6,data analysis was informed by grounded theory methods and techniques
2021-0322,7,"findings: grounded in data, this paper puts forward a typology of comfort zoning and its four types: nimbling, imperiling, cocooning and discomforting"
2021-0322,8,"research limitations/implications: following the tenets of the grounded theory, four criteria are used to evaluate the emergent theory: fit, relevance, workability and modifiability"
2021-0322,9,"it is expected the interpretation and adoption of comfort zoning typology will be challenged, modified and enhanced by fintech researchers and practitioners"
2021-0322,10,"practical implications: the comfort zoning typology would aid practitioners in their efforts to define and refine the domain of fintech, problematize it and eventually enhance the relationship between fintechs"
2021-0322,11,originality/value: this paper fulfills an identified need to explore the relationship between fintechs and incumbents and advance the theoretical and practical understanding of this relationship
2021-0323,0,"based on theoretical analysis and both the digital economy development index and the fintech development index, we use a time and individual two-way fixed effects model to study the impact of the digital economy on fintech, and the mechanism at work"
2021-0323,1,our results show that the digital economy can promote fintech development and that this development level will increase by 12.4117 standard deviations each time the development level of the digital economy increases by one standard deviation
2021-0323,2,the underlying mechanism is that the digital economy augments the level of technological innovation to promote fintech development
2021-0323,3,the digital economy enhances the fintech development level by improving the quality of credit assets
2021-0323,4,"further research shows that the digital economy's promotion effect on fintech is heterogeneous, given the proportion of agricultural loans: the higher the proportion of agricultural loans, the lower the digital economy's promotion effect on fintech"
2021-0324,0,the purpose of this paper is to explore determinants of the debt financing of fintech start-ups
2021-0324,1,"using a new hand-collected multisource database that maps fintech start-ups incorporated in the uk from 2010 to 2015, this study examines how the characteristics of fintech start-ups affect the types of financing used in the first three years after incorporation"
2021-0324,2,the novelty of this study consists in the identification and analysis of the determinants that enable fintech start-ups to obtain long-term debt and hence to finance their growth
2021-0324,3,the analysis is primarily conducted via a tobit regression model
2021-0324,4,"this paper contributes to the literature since we still have limited understanding of the financing of fintech firms, even if academic literature examining the financing of start-ups has expanded in the last few years"
2021-0324,5,the results from the empirical analysis demonstrate that unregulated fintech start-ups are more likely to be financed with long-term debt
2021-0324,6,"asset structure, owner characteristics and the specific fintech activity influence the funding source"
2021-0324,7,"moreover, fintech start-ups backed by equity investors receive less long-term debt funding than their peers"
2021-0324,8,a better understanding of the debt financing of fintech start-ups provides managers with valuable insights into ways of managing their firms
2021-0324,9,"furthermore, our results have relevant implications for the employment, competition and innovation, given the role that start-ups generally play in the economy"
2021-0324,10,"the study is limited to a sample of fintech start-ups incorporated in an advanced economy, and thus the generalization of the presented results to developing economies will require caution"
2021-0325,0,"this panel is bringing together an international cohort of 5 academics offering an abundant vicinity of insights and foresights, stimulating audience engagement"
2021-0325,1,"in alignment to the identified conference themes, panel discussants and presenters share their expertise on topics surrounding a) the conceptualization of fintech in higher education, b) the development of curricula and teaching material in the context of fintech as an emerging field of research, teaching and practice and c) the adoption of cross-industrial teaching and learning models for career-ready fintech professionals"

2021-0326,0,the financial services industry is facing existence-threatening changes due to the implementation of robo-advisors or applications that deliver and execute financial advice through automated algorithms on digital platforms in financial services
2021-0326,1,"despite the high practical relevance of robo-advisors, a comprehensive understanding of this technology is missing"
2021-0326,2,we aim at filling this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on robo-advisors using a sample of 39 articles
2021-0326,3,"our preliminary findings based on the analysis of 18 publications from the is field demonstrate that prior research mostly focused on customer reactions to robo-advisors, leaving factors that lead to the introduction and development of robo-advisory services, their underlying functionalities and the consequences of their implementation for organizations underexamined"
2021-0326,4,"with this study, we aim at extending research on financial technology and supporting organizations that consider implementing robo-advisors in their services by highlighting possible implications of this decision"

2021-0327,2,"for robustness tests, the authors introduce different proxies of fintech credit, perform sub-sample analysis and substitute control variables, as well as conduct their empirical strategy to tackle potential endogeneity issue"
2021-0327,3,findings: the authors document some significant findings
2021-0327,4,"first, the authors evidence implies that fintech credit tends to reduce bank profitability, while improving bank risk-related performance"
2021-0327,5,"this suggests that as fintech grows, it competes with banks and takes some share of profits, but it also benefits banks in terms of stability"
2021-0327,6,"second, stricter regulations contribute positively to bank stability"
2021-0327,7,"third, the authors argue that the impact of fintech credit on bank performance may depend on the degree of banking regulation, and find that fintech credit would impose a more positive influence on bank stability as more stringent banking regulation is present"
2021-0327,8,"originality/value: this study is the first to investigate whether fintech credit influences bank performance, considering the moderating impact of bank regulations"
2021-0327,9,the findings imply that fintech credit tends to be more beneficial when bank regulations become stricter
2021-0327,10,"therefore, they bring relevant implications to the regulators, as well as bank and fintech managers with regard to the potential cooperation"
2021-0161,0,"the fintech industry in indonesia is developed to facilitate more loans for micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes) across the archipelago"
2021-0161,1,"but, since early 2018 to present, the investment alert task force and the ministry of communication and informatics have blocked 3,198 illegal fintech platforms"

2021-0161,7,this research model was created to answer research questions that will look at the relationship between financial literacy and illegal fintech in msmes in west java
2021-0161,8,the results of the analysis above state that financial literacy has a significant effect on illegal fintech
2021-0161,9,"many people are trapped in illegal fintech because it provides convenience in transactions such as easy and fast loan applications, although not cheap (fine fees and loan interest)"
2021-0161,10,"therefore, financial literacy is very important to cut the rampant illegal fintech in indonesia"
2021-0161,11,this study is the first study to examine specifically the effect of financial literacy on illegal fintech on msmes in indonesia
2021-0161,12,the findings of this study are very interesting because it is true that financial literacy is a very important variable in eradicating the rise of illegal fintech
2021-0161,13,so that msmes can increase and grow without fraud from illegal fintech

2021-0328,2,"however, in order to ensure full assessment has been conducted, we sought expert advice on the validity and quality of the published articles from independent peer reviewers"
2021-0328,3,"following this post publication peer review, the editor has determined that the articles do not meet the required scholarly standards to remain published in the journal, and therefore has taken the decision to retract"
2021-0328,4,the concerns raised have been shared with the authors and they have been given the opportunity to respond
2021-0328,5,the authors have been informed about the retraction of the article

2021-0329,0,we use the introduction of a u.s
2021-0329,1,commercial credit bureau to study when lenders adopt voluntary information sharing technology and the resulting consequences for competition and credit access
2021-0329,2,our results suggest that lenders trade off access to new markets against heightened competition for their own borrowers
2021-0329,3,"lenders that initially do not adopt lose borrowers to competitors that do, which ultimately compels them to adopt and leads to the formation of an information sharing system"
2021-0329,4,access to credit improves but only for high-quality borrowers in markets with greater lender adoption
2021-0329,5,we provide the first direct evidence on when financial intermediaries adopt information sharing technologies and how sharing systems form and evolve
2021-0330,0,"in modern times, enhancing energy efficiency is one of the core agenda items for the economies to progress the world"
2021-0330,1,united nations general assembly has recommended increasing energy efficiency by considering the sdg-7 guidelines
2021-0330,2,"in the contemporary period, e7 economies are deficient in producing the financial resources to ensure the availability of funds for the acquisition of energy efficiency"
2021-0330,3,"covid-19 crises, lack of resilience in economies, devastating fiscal burdens, and tight monetary conditions of e7 economies are the major barriers"
2021-0330,4,"to resolve such issues, some innovative financing techniques, such as green financing, financial inclusion, and fintech, were suggested to investigate"
2021-0330,5,"however, this research tested the empirical role of financial inclusion, green financing, and fintech on the energy efficiency of e7 economies"
2021-0330,6,study findings have shown a significant role of such financing techniques on energy efficiency
2021-0330,7,"comparatively, green financing is found most fitting and highly supportive financing tool for energy efficiency among the three"
2021-0330,8,"the differences in attributes, financing mechanism, funds flow system, transection systems, and variation in support by the financial institution are the main reasons that lessen the role of financial inclusion and fintech for energy efficiency"
2021-0330,9,"however, theorists must revisit the transaction system of fintech and financial inclusion parameters like green bonds for energy efficiency attainment"
2021-0330,10,"policymakers are suggested to develop viable and energy system-friendly policies to grant green finance to the energy systems of e7 economies, as conveniently as possible"

2021-0332,2,"accordingly, we tracked the behavior of 21 firms based on the empirical material of 32,716 posts on twitter"
2021-0332,3,the outcomes showed dissimilar discourses based on fintech firms activities
2021-0332,4,"however, it was found that only financial infrastructure, lending, and personal finance fields have a discourse related to innovation and, to a lesser extent, related to the sdgs thematic"
2021-0332,5,"thus, awareness of sustainable objectives is still far from being a relevant issue for fintech, which, in general, has neglected to significantly mention sdgs"
2021-0332,6,"nonetheless, innovation and related terms are a consistent topic in this area"
2021-0332,7,"furthermore, hints of the implementation of the open innovation paradigm and interest in novel technologies are demonstrated, in addition to the promotion of different actors and events on social media that serve as a showcase for firms that have a presence on twitter"
2021-0160,0,there is a common assumption that the adoption of ai and ml in financial markets will make markets more competitive and reduce consumer prices
2021-0160,1,"this paper argues, however, that this is far from obvious and identifies when increases in competition are unlikely to arise"
2021-0160,2,there are several key messages
2021-0160,3,"it is argued that, in contrast to the experience in bigtech markets, the widespread use of ai and ml at the sector-wide level is unlikely to lead to any significant short-term changes in concentration in financial markets"
2021-0160,4,"in the longer term, however, the question of whether there will be more concentration will depend on the balance of two opposing forces"
2021-0160,5,"on the one hand, rapid acceleration of the nascent merging of the boundaries between bigtech and financial markets could increase concentration"
2021-0160,6,"but on the other, action around the significant tightening of bespoke regulations, notably regulatory mandated data sharing, could push in the opposite direction"
2021-0160,7,"at the micro-market level, it is also argued that the impact of adopting ai and ml will be very sensitive to the specifics of the market (e.g"
2021-0160,8,the impact of any consequent reduction of asymmetry of information is highly sensitive to the underlying asymmetry)
2021-0333,0,"this special issue of the oxford review of economic policy, based on papers presented at a bank of england conference, explores the impact of artificial intelligence (ai) on financial services"
2021-0333,1,this opening article provides an overview of ai and its increased use in the financial sector
2021-0333,2,considers the implications for consumers and competition in the sector
2021-0333,3,looks at the consequences for central bankers and regulators
2021-0333,4,and reflects on a more distant world where ai is far more advanced than today
2021-0333,5,"in short, the effect of ai on financial services is likely to be transformative, but that impact remains complex and uncertain"

2021-0335,0,the main objective of this study is to investigate banks' perception of fintech growth in nigeria and how such growth affects their ict investment decisions
2021-0335,1,"fintech has brought to the forefront the significance of ict by providing traditional banking services, which were hitherto the exclusive rights of incumbent banks"
2021-0335,2,"this has made banks to increase their ict expenditure by investing heavily in digital banking and on accelerators, alliances and innovation laboratories"
2021-0335,3,"guided by the sense and respond theory, an in-depth interview was conducted and later transcribed manually without the use of any software"
2021-0335,4,the analysis of the findings revealed that fintechs are both threat and opportunity to nigerian banks and are impacting positively on their ict investment decisions
2021-0335,5,"finally, this study recommends further research on the effectiveness of banks' ict investments decisions in containing the growth of fintech in nigeria"

2021-0336,2,"in poland, in 2019, about 75% of the millennials used the services of fintech"
2021-0336,3,this paper aims to analyse and evaluate the selected determinants of using the innovative fintech services by millennials in poland
2021-0336,4,"to investigate how users adopt fintech services, we have applied our own set of determinants  selected from an extensive literature review  covering both demographic, economic and behavioural characteristics"
2021-0336,5,this approach allowed for an in-depth analysis of the examined issue
2021-0336,6,the essential empirical data were obtained based on the research using the cawi method in december 2019 on a representative sample of poles aged 2540 at that time
2021-0336,7,"ultimately, 1,236 correctly completed questionnaires were used for the research"
2021-0336,8,"to analyse and evaluate the impact of selected determinants of fintech adoption, a logistic regression model was used"

2021-0336,11,millennials most open to innovative fintech services in poland are young men with high and very high net income and not driven by low costs of financial services
2021-0336,12,"they appreciate technological novelties, including the possibility of using a smartwatch, and when deciding on the choice of a financial institution, they do not care about the direct opinions of their relatives and friends, but take into account the opinions in social media"
2021-0337,0,this study analyses the predictive power of press releases for the performance of fintech start-ups
2021-0337,1,"using quantitative content analysis, we investigate a sample of 1570 press releases, issued between 2007 and 2016, and refer to the structural, linguistic and content elements of these business disclosures"
2021-0337,2,"our results suggest that the sentiment, complexity, psychological distance and future-orientation of announcements are positively associated with the fintechs performance, while a negative interaction is revealed for the frequency"
2021-0337,3,"with regard to the content categories, we provide evidence that news about financing rounds, partnerships, and business development are positively related to the venture growth"

2021-0338,0,financial decision supporting is a very important and complex problem
2021-0338,1,the aim of this paper is the development of the supervised learning method based on machine learning algorithms
2021-0338,2,"contemporary machine learning methods, are often used"
2021-0338,3,many research works and practical implementation focus on supporting decisions on stock markets
2021-0338,4,"however, most of them are related to developed markets in the usa, west europe or asian stock markets"
2021-0338,5,there is a lack of research related to the comparison of algorithms on the backtesting simulator and the warsaw stock exchange (wse)
2021-0338,6,"the best results were achieved by the logistic regression, this may be due to insufficient data suitable for more complex algorithms"
2021-0338,7,"using a simulator to test stock market algorithms, has many advantages, we operate in an environment that is closer to the real one, we can estimate how much the model earned, how many trades it would execute and what the risk is"
2021-0338,8,"in future research, it is worth checking selected algorithms on a larger data set"
2021-0339,0,purpose: fintech is having a profound impact in sub-saharan africa (ssa) because it offers more financial inclusion
2021-0339,1,"in this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of fintech, base of the pyramid (bop) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the ssa context"
2021-0339,2,"design/methodology/approach: the current paper uses a qualitative research design with open-ended, in-depth interviews as the main data sources"
2021-0339,3,the authors interviewed respondents from the sierra leone fintech association and four bop entrepreneurs operating in different sectors
2021-0339,4,"findings: the authors find that fintech services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations"
2021-0339,5,"fintech also offers growth possibilities for bop entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies"
2021-0339,6,"at the same time, fintech contributes to social value by enhancing bop entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development"
2021-0339,7,"research limitations/implications: this study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between bop entrepreneurship, social value creation and fintech"
2021-0339,8,"for example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like fintech"
2021-0339,9,"however, in a country like sierra leone, which has experienced both a civil war and ebola outbreak, insecurity has been one of the biggest concerns expressed by bop inhabitants"
2021-0339,10,"hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on fintech's application in bop contexts"
2021-0339,11,practical implications: a key managerial implication relates to micro-firm entrepreneurs and information specific benefits
2021-0339,12,fintech offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs
2021-0339,13,fintech offers bop entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development
2021-0339,14,"from a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating fintech charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more bop entrepreneurs using these services"
2021-0339,15,"social implications: the authors find that at the same time, fintech contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of bop consumers who interact with case firms"
2021-0339,16,originality/value: this paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on bop entrepreneurship and social value creation by fintech services in an ssa context
2021-0339,17,"it is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's fintech association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or fintech firms"

2021-0340,3,"such a practice could also occur among bigtechs, which are soon to become dominant players in the payment services sphere"
2021-0340,4,the first part of this article pertains to the payment services directive ii and to what extent it has contributed towards levelling the playing field between banks and fintechs
2021-0340,5,the second part of this paper analyses the extent to which provisions of the proposed digital markets act (dma) could help contribute towards levelling the playing field between bigtechs and fintechs
2021-0341,0,purpose: this paper aims to provide a review of literature directions regarding the potential impact of fintech operators on the financial services market globally
2021-0341,1,this paper reviews the literature to identify possible benefits or challenges that fintech firms can have for the traditional banking system

2021-0341,3,"the scopus database, ssrn database and google scholar were used to find relevant research papers"
2021-0341,4,the final sample included impactful papers about the effect of fintech activities on the banking and financial services industry
2021-0341,5,"findings: the current paper indicated that while fintech firms would take some market share away from banks, it is not expected that fintech firms would substitute banks"
2021-0341,6,"however, banks are required to accelerate their adoption of innovations and advanced technology to compete with fintech firms"
2021-0341,7,it is also proposed that strategic partnerships and cooperation could happen between banks and fintech companies in a way that benefits both sides
2021-0341,8,originality/value: the present paper adds to the understanding of the effect of the fintech firms growth on the banking industry in light of the emerging opportunities and threats for the financial sector
2021-0341,9,the paper also provides guidance for fruitful research on the impact of fintech activities on social and economic welfare in the future

2021-0343,3,"this study develops a novel double ffi model and applies the structural equation modelling to simultaneously analyze the interaction between financial technology, financial inclusion, and income inequality in a panel of 25 african countries over the periods 2011, 2014, and 2017"
2021-0343,4,the results show that financial inclusion mediates the financial technology-income inequality relationship thus playing a fundamental role in reducing income inequality in africa
2021-0343,5,"on the policy front, the study urges african policymakers and regulators to craft policies that enhance fintech developments and financial inclusion"
2021-0344,0,financial institutions have adopted big data to a considerable extent to provide better investment decisions
2021-0344,1,"consequently, high-frequency algorithmic traders use a vast amount of historical data with various statistical models to maximize their trading profits"
2021-0344,2,"until recently, high-frequency algorithmic trading was the domain of institutional traders with access to supercomputers"
2021-0344,3,"nowadays, any investor can potentially make high-frequency trades because of easy access to big data and software to analyze and execute trades"
2021-0344,4,"with that in mind, borsa istanbul introduced real time big data analytics as a product to its customers"
2021-0344,5,these analytics are derived in real time from order book and trade data and aim to level the playing field between investment firms and retail traders
2021-0344,6,"using classical benchmark models in the literature, we show that borsa istanbul's order imbalance-based data analytics are useful in predicting both time-series and cross-sectional intraday excess future returns, proving that this product is extremely beneficial to market participants, particularly day traders"

2021-0345,2,"based on ethnographic data collected with three different projects, i discuss the process of earmarking financial operations by means of philosophical concepts or theories, which enable the re-interpretation of the process of financialisation of everyday life"
2021-0345,3,i further analyse the conceptual socialization of these technological endeavours with the wider-reaching theme of accelerating the capitalist process with the objective to overturn its excessive powers
2021-0345,4,"the paper concludes by suggesting that fintech experiments which are socialized with accelerationist narratives re-interpret the process of financialisation as a path of liberation instead of exploitation, offering an escape from the capitalist crisis through machinic alchemy"

2021-0347,0,this paper develops a contingent claim model of a risk-averse life insurers equity with various borrowing-firm credit risk features
2021-0347,1,the insurers lending function with various financial technology involvements creates the need to model equity as a capped/naked call option in insurer-borrowing firms
2021-0347,2,"as a result, the insurer benefits from the capped-risk lending strategy yielding a higher interest margin"
2021-0347,3,"however, either the severe novel coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic or the substantial risk aversion deteriorates policyholder protection"
2021-0347,4,"in addition, stringent insurer capital regulation reduces the insurers interest margin, thus increasing policyholder protection and contributing to insurance stability but discouraging insurer financial technology involvements"

2021-0349,1,"leveraging a sample of 1,617 hand collected icos over 2015-2019 and regressions models, we find that a country's legal origin, disease environment, exposure to slave trade, and proximity to ancient trade routes are important determinants of the total amount of capital raised through icos"
2021-0349,2,further analyses suggest that the impact of historical endowment operates through legal and information sharing institutions
2021-0349,3,this finding suggests that traumatic shocks in the history plays an important role in shaping current fintech development through long-run persistence of formal and informal institutions
2021-0349,4,this research highlights the importance to enlarge the scope of fintech research and the importance to take institutions into account in relevant policy designs to promote financial development

2021-0350,1,"since the creation of the first cryptocurrency, the bitcoin, in 2009, it is estimated that over five thousand variants of the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have emerged"
2021-0350,2,virtual currencies have become widespread across the globe but their legal status and uses in various countries have remained uncertain
2021-0350,3,"they have been variously classified as currencies, securities, properties, assets, commodities and tokens, and used as means of exchange but are not legally recognised as legal tender"
2021-0350,4,"in many jurisdictions their emergence was greeted with scepticism and express or tacit rejection by financial and securities markets regulators, but over time, owing to their increasing popularity, characteristics, positive and negative potentials, there has been a gradual shift towards their formal recognition and regulation"
2021-0350,5,regulatory authorities in many countries are now grappling with designing appropriate policy and regulatory framework for the crypto phenomenon
2021-0350,6,"this paper interrogates the current legal status and efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies in two leading african nations, nigeria and south africa, and highlights the challenges of designing an appropriate regulatory framework for this enigmatic technology"
2021-0350,7,"the paper adopts the doctrinal legal research methodology, employing the descriptive, analytical, and comparative approaches"
2021-0350,8,it follows a structured review and analysis of relevant extant legislation on currencies and securities in the countries to ascertain whether they cover cryptocurrencies
2021-0350,9,it then compares the current position of the law on the subject in the two countries
2021-0350,10,"bearing in mind that it may not be possible to totally ban dealing in cryptocurrencies, the paper concludes that regulation has become imperative"
2021-0350,11,"drawing from the position on the subject in more developed nations, the united states of america (us) and the european union (eu), this paper proposes a model of regulation of virtual currency not only for nigeria and south africa but also for other african countries"
2021-0351,0,"in this paper, we examine the impact of corporate reputation on fintech firms"
2021-0351,1,"using a unique hand-collected dataset of customer complaints, violations, hacks/data breaches, and lawsuits"
2021-0351,2,"we find that markets negatively react to violation announcements, especially for lawsuits"
2021-0351,3,"our findings show that despite their popularity, corporate wrongdoing is skyrocketing and can negatively impact fintech firms"
2021-0351,4,"these findings have implications for fintech management, stakeholders, and investors"
2021-0352,0,"using a panel of 78 countries for 2013  2019, i show that fintech credit platforms can act as both complements and substitutes for traditional bank credit and that banking sector characteristics are likely to play a part in shaping the relationship"
2021-0352,1,"estimates suggest that in less concentrated, more liquid and more stable banking sectors, banks and fintech credit platforms tend not to compete for the same clientele and coexist as complements"
2021-0352,2,"on the other hand, in less stable and highly concentrated banking sectors, i find evidence that fintech may act as a direct substitute to bank credit"
2021-0353,0,financial technology (fintech) is widely recognised as important in addressing financial inclusion
2021-0353,1,"however, limited research theorises how new entrants and incumbents work together in fintech ecosystems to shape financial inclusion"
2021-0353,2,"we undertake a theory-generating case study with multilevel interacting organisations in ghana, where, like many other african countries, the growth in fintech has led to new opportunities for financial inclusion"
2021-0353,3,"we conceptualise three practices, as building blocks at the ecosystem level, through which incumbents and new entrants shape financial inclusion: (1) innovative and collaborative practices, (2) protectionist and equitable practices, and (3) legitimising and sustaining practices"
2021-0353,4,"we articulate a theoretical model that explains how the practices shape financial inclusion and propose three theoretical propositions of how financial inclusion in developing countries is being scaled and shaped in terms of actors, relationships, and practices"
2021-0354,0,"economic disadvantage tends to affect vulnerable groups among poor individuals, especially those working in the lower-income distribution sectors"
2021-0354,1,most b40 households will be much affected since they are vulnerable and can easily experience shock due to their low income
2021-0354,2,this research aims to assess the mediating effects of financial behaviour of 428 respondents from b40 households in selangor districts on financial vulnerability using a non-probability sampling (purposive stratified sample)
2021-0354,3,regression analyses were performed using spss version 26.0 to determine the influential factors and the mediating effect of financial behaviour
2021-0354,4,"the financial vulnerability models fitness was indicated in the moderate r squares of 0.290 and 0.327, where the model explains 29.0 per cent and 32.7 per cent of the variances in financial vulnerability"
2021-0354,5,"financial vulnerability was explained by the models factors comprising of financial literacy, financial stress, and internal locus of control in the first model as well as financial behaviour in the second model"
2021-0354,6,both models without (f = 27.6444
2021-0354,7,p = .000) and with the financial behaviour variable (f = 22.565
2021-0354,8,p = .000) were valid models based on the anova output
2021-0354,9,financial stress has a positive impact on financial vulnerability whereas internal locus of control and financial literacy have a negative influence on financial vulnerability
2021-0354,10,financial behaviour was found to have full mediation only towards the influence of internal locus of control on financial vulnerability
2021-0354,11,those who are considered internals have to do proper financial activities to become less financially vulnerable
2021-0354,12,"hence, doing financial activities are important for these internals in managing their financial situation"
2021-0354,13,"in order to help households improve their financial management, responsible practices such as good use of consumer loans, restructuring of debt, financial education, and debt consultation services should be strengthened"
2021-0355,0,the global financial market is undergoing transformational changes under the growing influence of innovative factors
2021-0355,1,"such changes are due, in particular, to the concentration and scaling up and diversification of the structure of financial services, the renewal of the financial sector on the basis of fintech operations and blockchain technologies"
2021-0355,2,this requires taking into account the impact of innovation factors on the transformation of the financial market in the dimension of fintech
2021-0355,3,the study aims to identify the imperatives of global financial innovation and show ways to develop innovative models in the interpretation of s-curves for next-generation products using new technologies when key technologies on the previous s-curve become obsolete
2021-0355,4,"also, the matrix of financial innovations is presented and the synergy of its innovation models is proved"
2021-0355,5,"the results of the study are to prove that each of the presented models is not independent, it evolves and develops itself, as well as affects other models"
2021-0355,6,this made it possible to identify prognostic pathways for the development of innovative models in their synergy in the form of two-ring motion
2021-0355,7,"thus, the study emphasizes the need for further research aimed at developing innovative models that will determine strategic decisions in the formation of innovation imperatives"
2021-0356,0,we investigate the return and volatility spillovers between a fintech etf and the etfs of the traditional financial industry with an empirical network model
2021-0356,1,"we find that the traditional financial etfs are still the main givers, and the fintech etf is the net receiver"
2021-0356,2,the fintech etf does not lead to greater volatility and financial instability in most of the traditional financial sectors
2021-0356,3,"the information transmission between these etfs is high, especially during the period of us-china trade friction"
2021-0356,4,our results provide a full understanding of the effect of changes in information transmission between fintech and the traditional financial industry
2021-0357,0,purpose: this study seeks to identify the factors that are associated with the digital transformation of microfinance institutions (mfis)
2021-0357,1,design/methodology/approach: the study employs probit models to investigate the likelihood of integrating digital solutions by mfis and heckman models for robustness checks
2021-0357,2,findings: the findings reveal that the adoption of these tools is consistent with the social performance of mfis
2021-0357,3,"furthermore, the profitability of the institutions and their home country development are associated with a larger application of digital support solutions"
2021-0357,4,"research limitations/implications: since the survey data collected is not longitudinal and does not cover many mfis, it may encounter the absence of comprehensive results"
2021-0357,5,"moreover, the study is limited to supply-side incentive factors, thus lacks of investigations under supply-demand interaction schemes"
2021-0357,6,"therefore, future studies are encouraged to fill up these knowledge gaps"
2021-0357,7,practical implications: the results imply that the adoption of digital solutions does not necessarily harm the social performance of mfis
2021-0357,8,"in addition, the findings may imply that financial sustainability can serve as being a preliminary condition but must not lead to the mission drift of mfis"
2021-0357,9,"findings of the study have implications for policymakers, donors and investors who wish to accelerate the digital transformation within the microfinance industry and to significantly boost financial inclusion"
2021-0357,10,a focus on more social-oriented mfis can be an appropriate solution
2021-0357,11,"furthermore, the pathway to digital financial inclusion through microfinance can be made more efficient if improved and supportive facilities as well as systems for digital technology are available"
2021-0357,12,originality/value: this paper is the first one which highlights the relationship between the mfi's social performance and the application of digital solutions by mfis
2021-0357,13,"furthermore, we discuss this link while considering cost aspects"
2021-0358,0,artificial intelligence has disrupted the financial services industry
2021-0358,1,"the emerging innovations such as, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, and data mining leave no financial institutions across the globe untouched"
2021-0358,2,"these advances have profoundly predisposed several facets of financial markets like investments, transfers, billings, rewards, insurance, remittances, underwriting etc"
2021-0358,3,"fintech companies were the early adopters of these ai powered innovations to promote greater budgetary awareness, human life development, improved decision-making, and more"
2021-0358,4,"this paper explores the growth of fintech in india, its associated challenges, and the opportunities emerging from high penetration, demographic dividend and connectivity to modern and affordable technology, low smartphone rates, and public policies like digital india, make in india, etc"
2021-0358,5,"through uses cases of artificial intelligence, the paper also elaborates how artificial intelligence fosters fintech companies"
2021-0358,6,"lastly, this paper suggests strategies that may help practitioners and researchers to tap the untapped potentials of fintech in india"
2021-0359,0,this article contributes to the discussion about managing the risks and uncertainties of emerging technologies through increased stakeholder participation
2021-0359,1,"authorities have increasingly invited stakeholders from high-technology sectors to participate in assessing the risks of, and designing responses to, new technologies"
2021-0359,2,yet authorities often struggle to attract stakeholders from such sectors to participate
2021-0359,3,a critical challenge identified but still undertheorised in the literature
2021-0359,4,"responding to this gap, this article presents a case study of the uk's regulatory sandbox for financial technologies, applying a document study, questionnaire and interviews to explore fintech firm motivations and apprehensions about participation"
2021-0359,5,"drawing on the bureaucratic reputation literature, the study finds that fintech firms have a range of practical, reputational and normative motivations to participate, and these motivations are inextricably tied to the regulator's strong reputation with the sector as procedurally correct, high-performing and morally committed to facilitating innovation"
2021-0359,6,"on this basis, recommendations for practitioners and hypotheses for future research into the drivers of stakeholder participation in regulatory decision-making surrounding emerging technologies are proposed"
2021-0158,0,this article reflects on the role of physical settings in the inculcation of militant practices consonant with specific discourses
2021-0158,1,"to do so, it draws on firsthand empirical information derived from a multi-sited ethnographic case study of an international cooperative that formed in europe in the aftermath of the euro crisis and deployed decentralised cryptocurrencies and alternative digital banking"
2021-0158,2,"here, space is viewed as a relevant material resource that can be occupied and organised to enable the telling of a particular story of revolution, redistribution, and horizontality, while simultaneously helping to actualise that story"
2021-0158,3,the materiality of space is thus related to its expressivity and seen as contributing to both an experience of militancy and the recurrence of the underlying political tale
2021-0158,4,this approach stresses reminiscence rather than becoming
2021-0158,5,the existential dimensions of interaction and affection rather than the ontological one of ever-evolving sociotechnical assemblages
2021-0158,6,"on such grounds, the article proposes the concept of stoppage to account for the repetition of specific spatial dispositions that configure extra-institutional immersive environments"
2021-0044,0,"purpose: the automation of services is rapidly growing, led by sectors such as banking and financial investment"
2021-0044,1,the growing number of investments managed by artificial intelligence (ai) suggests that this technology-based service will become increasingly popular
2021-0044,2,this study examines how customers' technology readiness and service awareness affect their intention to use analytical ai investment services
2021-0044,3,"design/methodology/approach: the automation of services is rapidly growing, led by sectors such as banking and financial investment"
2021-0044,4,the growing number of investments managed by ai suggests that this technology-based service will become increasingly popular
2021-0044,5,this study examines how customers' technology readiness and service awareness affect their intention to use analytical ai investment services
2021-0044,6,"findings: the results indicated that customers' technological optimism increases, and insecurity decreases, their intention to use robo-advisors"
2021-0044,7,"surprisingly, feelings of technological discomfort positively influenced robo-advisor adoption"
2021-0044,8,this interesting finding challenges previous insights into technology adoption and value co-creation as analytical ai puts customers into a very passive role and reduces barriers to technology adoption
2021-0044,9,"the research also analyzes how consumers become aware of robo-advisors, and how this influences their acceptance"
2021-0044,10,originality/value: this is the first study to analyze the role of customers' technology readiness in the adoption of analytical ai
2021-0044,11,the authors link the findings to previous technology adoption and automated services' literature and provide specific managerial implications and avenues for further research
2021-0157,0,this paper introduces a novel high performing multimodal deep learning architecture(trans-dice) for stock movement prediction utilizing financial indicators and news data
2021-0157,1,our multimodal architecture uses dilated causal convolutions and transformer blocks for feature extraction from both data sources
2021-0157,2,the masked multi-head self-attention layers inside transformers preserve causality and improve features based on contextual information
2021-0157,3,"to integrate the derived multimodal model representations, we use stacked transformer blocks"
2021-0157,4,we show empirically that our model performs best compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods for s&p 500 index and individual stock prediction and provides a significant 3.45% improvement from 74.29% to 77.74%
2021-0157,5,we also demonstrate our model's utility for the portfolio management task
2021-0157,6,"we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework utilizing trans-dice for portfolio optimization, providing noticeable gain on sharpe ratio and 7.9% increase in portfolio value over the existing state of the art models"
2021-0360,0,the huge advancement in the field of communication has pushed the innovation pace towards a new concept in the context of internet of things (iot) named iot for financial technology applications (iot-fintech)
2021-0360,1,the main intention is to leverage the businesses&#x2019
2021-0360,2,income and reducing cost by facilitating the benefits enabled by iot-fintech technology
2021-0360,3,"to do so, some of the challenging problems that mainly related to routing protocols in such highly dynamic, unreliable (due to mobility) and widely distributed network need to be carefully addressed"
2021-0360,4,this paper therefore focuses on developing a new trustworthy and efficient routing mechanism to be used in routing data traffic over iot-fintech mobile networks
2021-0360,5,a new non-linear l&#x00e9;vy brownian generalized normal distribution optimization (nlbgndo) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of finding an optimal path from source to destination sensor nodes to be used in forwarding fintech&#x2019;s related data
2021-0360,6,we also propose an objective function to be used in maintaining trustworthiness of the selected relay-node candidates by introducing a trust-based friendship mechanism to be measured and applied during each selection process
2021-0360,7,"the formulated model also considering node&#x2019;s residual energy, experienced response time, and inter-node distance (to figure out density/sparsity ratio of sensor nodes)"
2021-0360,8,results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism could maintain very wise and efficient decisions over the selection period in comparison with other methods
2021-0360,9,iee
2021-0361,0,"purpose: the purpose of this study is to examine investors' internal characteristics, including investment literacy, risk tolerance and familiarity with mobile financial services, as antecedents of mobile investment technology adoption among american investors"
2021-0361,1,"design/methodology/approach: using the 2018 national financial capability study and its supplemental investor survey, this study examined antecedents, including investors' internal characteristics, in relation to mobile investment technology adoption"
2021-0361,2,nested logistic regression analyses were performed for adopting mobile apps for investment decisions and for investment trading
2021-0361,3,"findings: this study found that objective and subjective investment knowledge, experience using mobile banking for payments and money transfers, and certain ownerships of investment vehicles (such as whole-life insurance policies and etfs) were significant determinants of mobile investment decision-making"
2021-0361,4,"on the other hand, subjective investment literacy, risk tolerance, familiarity with mobile financial services, and portfolio value, as well as certain types of investment vehicles were significantly associated with mobile investment trading"
2021-0361,5,"originality/value: this study is among the first to examine investors' investment literacy, risk tolerance and familiarity with mobile financial services as investors' internal characteristics in relation to mobile investment technology adoption"
2021-0361,6,the diffusion of innovations theory and related concepts provide theoretical support for this study
2021-0361,7,"the findings provide new insights into mobile investing as an emerging fintech subject and provide implications for practitioners and fintech developers, as well as contribute to the literature of mobile investment service adoption among retail investors"
2021-0362,0,this study took online lending as the main research object to quantitatively measure fintech risk in china
2021-0362,1,a theoretical model was built to analyse the relationship between the assets and liabilities of peer-to-peer platforms and the risk of the entire online lending industry
2021-0362,2,the conditional value at risk method was used to measure the risk spillover effect of the online lending industry and the different types of platforms
2021-0362,3,index smoothing and moving average were used to examine risk contagion
2021-0362,4,"when the risk rate of the portfolio of the platform generally increases, the systemic risk of the whole industry also increases, and if the systemic risk of the industry spreads to the portfolio of the platform, it could affect the stability of the capital flow of the platform, and then affect the risk expectation of the platform itself"
2021-0362,5,most platforms with risk concerns were private
2021-0362,6,banking platforms and public platforms were greatly affected by market risk
2021-0362,7,"however, their own risks had relatively little impact on the overall market"
2021-0362,8,"the greater the market risk, the more platforms become risk platforms, and the smaller the impact on transition platforms"
2021-0362,9,regulatory sandboxes may be an effective means of preventing and controlling fintech risks
2021-0363,0,"nations worldwide have sought to capitalize on the benefits of distributed ledger technology (dlt) including blockchain, but struggled to strike a balance between encouraging investment and innovation in the technology while addressing the challenges and uncertainties through regulation"
2021-0363,1,"through its fintech (financial technology) strategy, qatar has sought to embrace dlt, but its regulatory approach also remains cautious"
2021-0363,2,"trade finance is an ideal business process to be disrupted through the benefits of dlt and especially blockchain technology, since its processes remain antiquated, inefficient and lack digitization"
2021-0363,3,"blockchain as a form of dlt particularly offers the trade finance process not only more rapid, secure, cost-effective and efficient procedures, but importantly completely assures trust between importers and exporters and removes the requirement to place such trust in third-party intermediaries"
2021-0363,4,qatar can reap considerable economic benefits through the enhancement of its trade finance regulations enabling the adoption of such blockchain technology
2021-0363,5,"as such, the authors propose a roadmap and manual for the governance of the trade finance blockchain ecosystem in qatar"
2021-0363,6,the authors propose multi-layered governance approach to the regulation of blockchain in qatar by (1) embracing international regulations and standards
2021-0363,7,(2) replicating foreign regional and national rules that are appropriate and innovative
2021-0363,8,and (3) applying sandbox regulations to blockchain products and services
2021-0364,0,"industry 4.0 and digital technology has been affecting banking activities in most of bank system in emerging markets, esp"
2021-0364,1,"in vietnam, one of the countries having high economic growth in asean nations"
2021-0364,2,"so, quality management of technology issues and cyber security management are rising"
2021-0364,3,"there are main technologies in 4.0 revolution to process information including: big data database technologies, cloud computing, machine learning, iot, ai, business intelligence, data mining and blockchain technologies"
2021-0364,4,these technologies are successively implemented in developed and improved security procedures it and cybersecurity risk management
2021-0364,5,"also changes to the operating environment it can occur suddenly and without warning, such as under the covid-19 international emergency"
2021-0364,6,"as the critical sector financial is adapting to expanded remote operations, there is the potential for increased vulnerabilities and potential amplification of the effect of cybersecurity threats"
2021-0364,7,"therefore, organizations need to own the ability to make in new ict and cybersecurity investments to quickly and effectively adapt to address unforeseen circumstances for better quality management of technology"
2021-0365,0,technological developments have accelerated disruption in various fields
2021-0365,1,even the financial system has now been disrupted
2021-0365,2,the emergence of financial technology (fintech) has spawned new companies with more competitive business models
2021-0365,3,"in this pandemic era, the number of digital payment users continues to increase"
2021-0365,4,this research analyses the factors that strengthened and weakened the digital payment services from the user perspective
2021-0365,5,researchers used qualitative research methods
2021-0365,6,data were collected by conducting in-depth online interviews with 193 digital payment users in indonesia during the pandemic
2021-0365,7,"factors that became the service strengths are, provide convenience (practical), give a sense of security, offer promos that benefit users, and conform with prevailing trends"
2021-0365,8,some factors become weaknesses of digital payment services
2021-0365,9,the first factor is related to network and software constraintsthe second factor is service security
2021-0365,10,the third factor is related to inadequate supporting facilities and infrastructure
2021-0365,11,the existence of administrative fees and minimum balances become the fourth factor
2021-0365,12,the fifth factor is associated with the elderly who find that the platform is complicated to usethe sixth factor-related consumptive behavior
2021-0365,13,"and the last element is the presence of marketing promises, which do not fit with reality"
2021-0366,0,the present study seeks to present a mathematical interpretation of the perception of new entrants to the global payments market on whether fintechs innovations promote competitiveness in the market
2021-0366,1,the study also quantitatively evaluates the competitive trends observed in the global payments market
2021-0366,2,the sampling frame consists of 504 respondents across 28 countries
2021-0366,3,the study is based on the analysis of the survey results using spss statistics and stata
2021-0366,4,"the survey addressed four groups of factors influencing the competitiveness of the payment system (i.e., costs, service channels, privacy and security, quality and efficiency)"
2021-0366,5,the respondents believe that fintech innovations have a strong positive effect on the payment systems competitiveness (m = 4.32)
2021-0366,6,"the results of the present study may be of interest to specialists and researchers who deal with the competitive dynamics of the global payments business, with payment innovations, and with convergence and transformation of the payments industry"
2021-0367,0,"fintech is rapidly changing the financial landscape, especially in the post-covid era"
2021-0367,1,"this study uses data from the world's first global ranking of fintech ecosystems, the global fintech index (gfi), to investigate the linkages between fintech development and demand for savings, borrowing, and remittances for 16 of the world's largest emerging economies"
2021-0367,2,our results find a consistently strong and positive relationship between fintech development and financial inclusion
2021-0367,3,"however, considerable heterogeneities persist across population groups and regions"
2021-0367,4,evidence also suggests that access may not translate to greater usage of financial services
2021-0367,5,the findings have important implications for future models of financial inclusion looking to harness the power of fintech
2021-0368,0,a finance company is a form of company that takes advantage of technological developments by creating fintech- applications to improve service quality
2021-0368,1,"in 2019, the customer service queue at xyz company (pt xyz) reached 350 queues per month"
2021-0368,2,"meanwhile, the cashier queues to make payments an average of 3800 per month"
2021-0368,3,"the high level of queues, can certainly have an impact on office effectiveness and efficiency"
2021-0368,4,"this study aims to analyze what constraints have caused the low number of fintech payment application users, how to map potential and non-potential customers usage of fintech applications"
2021-0368,5,"the results showed that the problem with the low use of the fintech payment application was because 60% of customers did not know the application, 40% of customers did not have a bank account so they could not make transactions on the fintech payment application and 67% of customers chose payment media through outlets / minimarkets even though they had to pay a fee"
2021-0368,6,"to determine the effectiveness of using the application, a tam (technology acceptance model) is used which consists of trust, value for profit, convenience, social influence and intention to use"
2021-0369,0,"in todays financial services landscape, staying ahead of the innovation curve and being disciplined at enhancing core service offerings entail careful resource planning"
2021-0369,1,a well-structured outsourcing arrangement can go a long way towards enhancing long term organizational strategic growth
2021-0369,2,"in the post-2014 fintech era, (i) strategic management with an innovation focus and (ii) financial technology-associated risks, have brought about changes to outsourcing in the financial services industry"
2021-0369,3,"presently, most outsourcing life cycle models in existing literature seek to provide comprehensive, yet industry-neutral guidelines lacking industry context and depth of coverage"
2021-0369,4,"a newly licensed financial institution deciding to embark on outsourcing but is uncertain about how to thread the increasingly complex fintech and financial regulatory landscape, will likely find domain-specific outsourcing life cycle models useful"
2021-0369,5,"a more targeted financial services outsourcing life cycle approach, with a focus on strategy and risk management in todays context, can contribute more effectively to the application and review of outsourcing implementation"
2021-0369,6,this research contributes to present literature by proposing a new strategy-risk outsourcing life cycle model
2021-0369,7,this is an elegant and simple-to-use end-to-end framework which can be utilized by the financial services industry to guide outsourcing decisions
2021-0369,8,the paper also recommends areas for future research
2021-0370,0,"in australia, a range of financial services, including education bonds, high interest personal loans and credit card debt, have long been used to help families pay for the cost of schooling"
2021-0370,1,"however, innovative financial technology (fintech) solutions are emerging which align with the growth of a lower risk buy now, pay later phenomenon"

2021-0388,1,"design/methodology/approach: this study has used the panel-corrected standard errors (pcse), two-stage panel least squares-instrumental variables (2sls-iv) and two-step system generalized method of moments (2sgmm) dynamic panel estimation method to investigate the dfi-islamic banking stability nexus using an unbalanced panel data of 65 islamic banks from six countries over the period 20112020"
2021-0388,2,"findings: the result suggests that greater implementation of dfi promotes islamic banking stability, which reduces the default risk of the banks in the studied region"
2021-0388,3,"consequently, incorporating dfi into the islamic banking sector encourages inclusive economic growth that can keep the financial sector sustainable even in a crisis period like the current covid-19 pandemic"
2021-0388,4,"originality/value: unlike previous studies, the authors have focused mainly on dfi and the islamic banking sector"
2021-0388,5,this is one of the first to explore how dfi contribute to the stability and productivity of the islamic banking sector during the pandemic
2021-0388,6,"also, this study provides fresh evidence on how the supply and demand side of dfi impact islamic banking stability"
2021-0389,0,purpose: innovation in digital technologies has been the main force in promoting growth and inclusion

2021-0389,5,this study collects secondary data to build the estimated model
2021-0389,6,"findings: contrary to conventional wisdom, this studys evidence suggests that there is a delayed effect between the contribution of p2p lending by fintech firms on economic growth in the country"
2021-0389,7,"while the immense growth of fintech seems promising, the findings indicate that fintech is far from its optimal point"
2021-0389,8,this study calculates the optimal combination between productive and consumptive lending and between java and non-java
2021-0389,9,"in view of this finding, this study proposes strategies to effectively distribute lending and bring about the expected benefit to the economy"
2021-0389,10,"practical implications: since the contribution of p2p lending on economic development has not reached its optimum, the findings expose the limitation of current technological innovation in the financial sectors"
2021-0389,11,"in this sense, p2p penetration on the financing market needs encouragement"
2021-0389,12,the calculations for optimal allocation between productive and consumptive and between java and non-java provide guidance to policymakers
2021-0389,13,this study helps practitioners to shape strategy and to begin experimenting with different approaches to distribute loans effectively

2021-0154,0,this study contributes to our understanding of how the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic changes the global banking financial services and insurance (bfsi) landscape
2021-0154,1,"before the covid-19 pandemic, bfsis corporate strategy was solely aligned to the quest for operational efficiency"
2021-0154,2,"however, during the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, global bfsis are forced to adopt digital transformation in their operations due to a rise in transaction volumes"
2021-0154,3,"the ongoing covid-19 pandemic already triggers holistic innovations concerning the global bfsi's product, process, concept, trend, or idea"
2021-0154,4,"thus, the bfsi cannot survive without efficient and innovative system software for global operations"
2021-0154,5,the study plots the hype cycle to identify relevant technologies to deal with real-world business problems
2021-0154,6,the hype cycle indicates that the need for advanced data integration is growing and covid-19 pandemic has already triggered it
2021-0154,7,the study argues that the incorporation of data integration might be challenging initially for bfsis but eventually it may result in an efficient model to handle these types of pandemic or unexpected circumstances
2021-0390,0,"financial technology is the result of technological progress in the financial aspect of the global economy, as this technology has given rise to a new emerging financing face embodied in start-up companies, which represent a challenge for traditional banks in their banking services, in addition to that, they constitute a fierce competitor, which may it controls the banking services, especially as it relies on artificial intelligence and smart phones, and facilitates (the process of payment, trade and electronic investment), and it comes in line with the large and rapid steps of possible changes in the financial system and global economic after the corona crisis and the call for leave dealing with the paper currency that is believed to be (the main reason for the transmission of the corona virus), so the research will answer for? what is financial technology? how does it work through its various sectors? and the reasons for the world resort to financial technology? and where will iraq be in this new world that needs to get alternatives and needs to keep pace with global development in the field of (investment, capital movement and achieving profits with the least possible risks), in order to achieve economic development and community development"
2021-0390,1,"but the question? what about the risks of dealing with financial technology? then does the iraqi economy and its financial and banking sector have the ability to overcome its risks, despite the many benefits, and does it have the ability to facilitate many complex operations and long transactions that are not without risks of fraud, fraud and threat of financial instability or the problem of financing terrorism and money laundering operations and those risks it can reduce confidence in the use of this technology"
2021-0391,0,"globally, fintech is a rapidly growing and evolving buzz word in the financial industry"

2021-0392,0,"the purpose of this article is to empirically examine and compare the factors or determinants of financial inclusion in commercial banking institutions, microfinance banks, mobile banking platforms and table banking groups (informal banking groups) in kenya"
2021-0392,1,the data used in the study were obtained from 631 small and micro-sized (sms) farming enterprises in kenya
2021-0392,2,we use probit model to empirically establish the factors that determine the probability of small and micro-sized farming enterprises in accessing agricultural credit from the four major lending institutions
2021-0392,3,"also, we apply heckman selection model to establish the determinants of agricultural credit rationing"
2021-0392,4,ols model is used to investigate the determinants of agricultural credit delinquency rates in the lending institutions
2021-0392,5,"the results show that female-owned sms farming enterprises are likely to access less agricultural credit amount from table banking groups, own small farms with no title deed and own less valued assets compared to male-owned sms farming enterprises which access agricultural credit from commercial banks and microfinance banks"
2021-0392,6,"further results revealed that household dependency ratio was a significant determinant factor in agricultural credit access from mobile banks, commercial banks and table banking groups"
2021-0392,7,"additionally, agricultural credit delinquency in mobile banking is significantly reduced by distance to the banking agent"
2021-0392,8,the availability of mobile banking agencies within village centres would considerably enable agri-entrepreneurs to make credit repayment within the required period
2021-0393,0,the core theme of systems engineering is a modeling language with model consistency of static systems structure and dynamic systems behavior
2021-0393,1,"in this research, we developed channel-based multi-queue structure-behavior coalescence process algebra (c-m-sbc-pa) as the formal language for the model singularity of the mobile payment fintech service systems design"
2021-0393,2,"in c-m-sbc-pa, a sole diagram is adopted to describe the syntax and semantics of the design of the service system"
2021-0393,3,"overall, the model consistency will be fully guaranteed in the mobile payment fintech service systems design when the c-m-sbc-pa method is used"
2021-0394,0,"housing prices globally remain very expensive for young adults while financial instruments to obtain them become more complicated, demanding, and discouraging, especially in the modern post global financial crisis (20072017)"

2021-0395,3,"a hierarchical model of robo-advisor acceptance was built that integrated product features, user perceptions, and use intention"
2021-0395,4,the model showed that the competence and expected earnings of a robo-advisor contribute to users perception of its usefulness
2021-0395,5,"furthermore, the customization and competence of a robo-advisor decreases users perceived risk"
2021-0395,6,"additionally, better designed account management and more authority for users increase perceived control over a robo-advisor"
2021-0395,7,"moreover, although usefulness was regarded as the most important factor, only perceived risk (negatively) and perceived control (positively) were significantly associated with the intention to use robo-advisors"
2021-0395,8,"based on the acceptance model, implications for the robo-advisor design were discussed"
2021-0396,0,"fintech applications such as robo-financial advisors (ras) are complex algorithmic decision making systems, which gained prominence with their claim to democratize finance"
2021-0396,1,"lack of transparency and explanations for these automated decisions leads to a trust deficit for users, limiting the potential of these applications"
2021-0396,2,our research aims to analyse the effectiveness of user-centric explanations in conveying the decision-making logic of complex algorithmic systems
2021-0396,3,"our user study tests techniques from explainable ai, varying in complexity and transparency"
2021-0396,4,the quantitative aspects of our study determine the efficacy and usability of explanations and the qualitative aspects measure the effect of explanations on users and system usability
2021-0396,5,our study finds trust and confidence of users in the system is positively correlated with comprehension and transparency provided by the presence of an explanation
2021-0396,6,there is a notable reduction in comprehension and trust between transparent white and opaque black box explanations of algorithms

2021-0400,5,"particularly blockchain technology provides the banking sector, security, performance, and cost reduction in many of their processes and provides quality of services to their users"
2021-0401,0,we propose a method to assess the counterparty risk of non-banking financial institutions that operate as fiat-crypto gateways in blockchain and distributed ledger technology financial infrastructures
2021-0401,1,the risk scores are suitable to evaluate both traditional money services businesses and fintech companies (including cryptocurrency payments and blockchain systems operators)
2021-0401,2,"the main users are banks, investors, and, businesses that need to assess counterparty risk across jurisdictions and under uncertainty, as non-banks are often less regulated than other financial institutions"
2021-0401,3,"we follow an automation-focused, multidisciplinary approach rooted in established techniques from network science and genetic programming, as well as in the emerging fields of machine behavior and trustworthy artificial intelligence"
2021-0401,4,"the method and findings pertain to any decentralized financial infrastructure with centralized components such as fiat on/off ramps, where counterparty risk assessment becomes a necessity for regulatory, investment, and, operational purposes"

2021-0402,7,"the results indicate that the number of robo-advisor users, assets under management amount, and the penetration rate increased even in 2020, as covered by the covid-19 pandemic"
2021-0402,8,"conversely, assets under management amount per person decreased"
2021-0143,0,the aim of this article is to develop a process that can emulate inclusive growth through the implementation of financial technology
2021-0143,1,inclusive growth is conceived in this work as an extension of basic economic rights to access vital networks and services
2021-0143,2,"thus, fintech is seen as one of the essential catalysts to increase the productivity of two billion underbanked people and therefore it can serve as a springboard towards inclusive growth"
2021-0143,3,the study of the experience of taobao in china made it possible to verify this observation through the inclusion of rural populations allowing them to diversify their activity and to contribute significantly to the increase of chinese rural gdp
2021-0143,4,the same goes for kenya with m-pesa allowing 77% of adult kenyans to access banking services and therefore ensure them a formal and structured integration into economic life

2021-0405,0,purpose: this paper aims to compare perceptions of islamic bank customers concerning fintech services in malaysia and saudi arabia
2021-0405,1,it also investigates the level to which customers are willing to adapt fintech services
2021-0405,2,design/methodology/approach: primary data was collected from may to september 2019 using a questionnaire to survey 102 islamic bank customers in malaysia and 147 in saudi arabia
2021-0405,3,the data are analyzed based on structural equation modelling using the partial least squares approach
2021-0405,4,"findings: the findings show that knowledge, attitude and subjective norms are the highly significant determining factors that influence customers opinions on adapting to new technology, but awareness demonstrates only a moderately positive effect"
2021-0405,5,"moreover, the impact of these factors on the intention to adopt fintech services significantly differs between malaysian and saudi arabian customers"
2021-0405,6,originality/value: this is an original study based on primary data on customers of islamic banking in malaysia and saudi arabia
2021-0405,7,it provides some novel insights into how the banking industry can boost customers confidence and enhance their patronage by adopting fintech in their business operation model
2021-0405,8,"these findings should be of value to senior management, policymakers and regulators in the banking industry in both muslim and non-muslim countries"
2021-0406,0,fintech embodies technological innovations in financial services
2021-0406,1,the scholarship in this area is fast-growing and correlates with a disruptive potential fintech has for the financial ecosystem
2021-0406,2,european regulation is also keeping up with this phenomenon
2021-0406,3,a case in point is the recently adopted eu crowdfunding regulation which is part of the eus fintech action plan and capital markets union agenda
2021-0406,4,its general goal is to promote financial development of european financial systems by enhancing alternative finance sources to bank lending and cross-border investments
2021-0406,5,"on the one hand, the eu crowdfunding regulation aims to enhance scalability for crowdfunding platforms service providers across the european single market through a single eu crowdfunding licence"
2021-0406,6,"on the other hand, regulation intends to provide a high level of investor protection across europe through a unified set of rules"
2021-0406,7,the purpose of this paper is twofold
2021-0406,8,"first, to outline the european regulatory and policy agenda in addressing disruptive impacts of fintech and crowdfunding on capital markets"
2021-0406,9,"second, to open and encourage timely policy discussions on how these regulatory trends could unfold in croatia and the south eastern european (see) region, characterised as more traditional financial markets services and developing capital markets in comparison to other member states"
2021-0406,10,"thus, the methodology combines secondary data analysis with a case study"
2021-0406,11,"our findings suggest that the likely effects of the eu crowdfunding regulation reflect in improved legal certainty for investors and increased potential for financial development in alternative financing, although there is significant space for improvement of the croatian financial ecosystem"
2021-0407,0,"the article examines the features of banks' lending activities and substantiates the prerequisites for strengthening their cooperation with financial companies, systematizes internal and external innovations used in the process of digitalization of the banking business"
2021-0407,1,"the periodization of the banking system from 2005 to the present in accordance with the strategic development goals and stages of the bank's life cycle has allowed to justify the relevant digitalization policy, appropriate for each period"
2021-0407,2,it has been proved that the symbiosis of banks and fintech companies helps to increase the competitiveness and profitability of business in the long run
2021-0407,3,"the importance of introduction of banking innovations in the crediting market as the most profitable direction of banking activity has been substantiated, the forecast of change in net interest income of ukrainian banks for the post-pandemic period has been made"
2021-0407,4,"based on the fact that the indicator of the country's success in implementing the norms and measures of the digital agenda for the eu and digital single market is the digital economy and society index (desi), which is determined for each eu country annually, the paper makes forecast changes in its components: connectivity, human capital, use of internet, integration of digital technology, digital public services"
2021-0407,5,the main factors that inhibit the processes of strengthening the interaction between banks and fintech companies in ukraine have been identified
2021-0407,6,the expediency of improving the current legislation of ukraine taking into account the best european practices in the field of cooperation between banks and fintech companies has been substantiated
2021-0408,0,"buy-now-pay-later (bnpl) arrangements have rapidly emerged as a short-term debt option, and like other innovative and disruptive fintech, challenge existing regulation"
2021-0408,1,"bnpl arrangements avoided prescribed responsible lending legislative obligations, which applied to similar short-term credit products"
2021-0408,2,"instead, bnpl relies on responsible spending in providing a potentially cheaper option than alternatives such as credit cards"
2021-0408,3,we describe the interplay of regulation and responsibility with bnpl
2021-0408,4,a survey investigates whether a key demographic (young adults) have an appetite or skill for responsible use
2021-0408,5,we analyse the preference for bnpl relative to credit cards and the role of financial literacy and traits including propensity to plan and save
2021-0408,6,the findings suggest that financial literacy reduces perceived bnpl benefits and that lower financial literacy is associated with more benefits and less risks

2021-0409,0,"research shows that black, latinx, and other minorities pay more for credit and banking services, and that wealth accumulation differs starkly between their households and white households"
2021-0409,1,"the link between debt in-equality and the wealth gap, however, remains less thoroughly explored, particularly in light of new credit products and debt-like banking services, such as early wage access and other fintech innovations"
2021-0409,2,these innovations both hold the promise of reducing racial and ethnic disparities in lending and bring concerns that they may be exploited in ways that perpetuate ine-quality
2021-0409,3,"they also come at a time when policy makers are considering how to help communities of color rebuild their wealth, presenting an opportunity to critique policy proposals"
2021-0409,4,"this article leverages that opportunity by syn-thesizing research about the long-term costs of debt inequality on commu-nities of color, adding an in-depth analysis of several new advances in banking and lending, and proposing several key principles for reducing debt inequality as an input to the wealth gap"
2021-0410,0,fixed-income corporate bond markets were the last bastion of non-electronic trading activity
2021-0410,1,for most of the twentieth century these markets were also dominated by the largest wall street dealer-banks
2021-0410,2,these banks had long argued that corporate bonds were too complex and illiquid to be electronified
2021-0410,3,"in reality though, opaque over-the-counter trading in these bonds allowed wall street to monopolise highly uncompetitive markets"
2021-0410,4,"this market environment had changed very little over the decades, despite the financial services revolutions that had gripped other markets"
2021-0410,5,"by the 2010s however, wall street banks had finally begun to lose their stranglehold"
2021-0410,6,"this paper tracks the two explanatory factors, the emergence of new financial technology and the decisive intervention of state managers and post-crisis regulationin the form of the volcker rule and basel iii"
2021-0410,7,"recent accounts have become increasingly sceptical of the disruptive, pro-competitive impact of fintech"
2021-0410,8,"we argue thatat least in markets for us corporate bondsthere is evidence of a more competitive, democratic market environment emerging as a direct result of new financial technologies"
2021-0411,0,this chapter argues that developments in exchange-traded funds (etfs) and fintech markets mark a qualitative shift in the function and interpretation of information
2021-0411,1,"whilst trading becomes quicker, nimbler and more voluminous under passive investment strategies augmented by automation, the role of information also changes in subtle ways"
2021-0411,2,"in particular, under these conditions, financial market prices will become increasingly self-referential"
2021-0411,3,"that is to say, investors in markets will no longer make investment decisions based upon information gathered by themselves or others - a hallmark of the efficient markets hypothesis (emh) - but through acting on the trading of a smaller group of active traders"
2021-0411,4,misinformed trades by active traders in the markets may not be countered by other informed investors
2021-0411,5,"rather, they would trigger more misinformed automated trades"
2021-0411,6,"these trading developments may undermine the price formation mechanism, especially if the composition of views amongst informed traders is skewed by behavioural biases in a particular direction"
2021-0411,7,"importantly, the disruptive impact of certain automated trading reduces the incentive for information gathering, as these algorithmically driven vehicles free-ride on research by active traders and use their resources and speed to front-run their trades"
2021-0411,8,"one effect of these developments is a reduction in the informativeness of financial market pricing, which, if persistent enough, may cause systemic instability"
2021-0412,0,"while regulation of financial intermediaries has been embraced because the industry is particularly prone to market failures, disintermediation has the potential to make current frameworks obsolete"
2021-0412,1,"the law and economics problem is twofold: (1) potential market failures, and (2) the issue of enforcement"
2021-0412,2,this chapter discusses the foundations of financial intermediation and the traditional regulatory approaches to both banks and other providers of financial services
2021-0412,3,our analysis establishes a distinction between fintechs working outside and inside the blockchain
2021-0412,4,"for the former, the crucial regulatory trade-off is between efficiency gains from innovation and regulatory arbitrage"
2021-0412,5,"for the latter, our analysis suggests that regulating the convertibility of cryptocurrencies into fiat money is a promising strategy not only to safeguard financial stability, but also to attract financial services to the regulatory perimeter, whenever it is efficient to do so"
2021-0413,0,financial technology is rapidly changing and shaping financial services and markets
2021-0413,1,"these changes are considered making the future of finance a digital one.this handbook analyses developments in the financial services, products and markets that are being reshaped by technologically driven changes with a view to their policy, regulatory, supervisory and other legal implications"
2021-0413,2,the handbook aims to illustrate the crucial role the law has to play in tackling the revolutionary developments in the financial sector by offering a framework of legally enforceable principles and values in which such innovations might take place without threatening the acquis of financial markets law and more generally the rule of law and basic human rights
2021-0413,3,"with contributions from international leading experts, topics will include: policy, high-level principles, trends and perspectives fintech and lending fintech and payment services fintech, investment and insurance services fintech, financial inclusion and sustainable finance cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets markets and trading regtech and suptech this handbook will be of great relevance for practitioners and students alike, and a first reference point for academics researching in the fields of banking and financial markets law"

2021-0414,1,the un sdgs provide a framework of detailed objectives and criteria in pursuing sustainable development
2021-0414,2,"central banks and financial regulators around the world are likewise considering how to enhance sustainable development in the context of their wider mandates for financial and economic development, while also balancing their other primary objectives, including monetary and financial stability, financial integrity and consumer protection"
2021-0414,3,financial inclusion involves delivering financial services at an affordable cost to all parts of society
2021-0414,4,"it enables people to manage their financial obligations efficiently, reduces poverty and supports wider economic growth"
2021-0414,5,"financial inclusion, and especially access to credit, therefore introduces individuals to a new array of financial risks"
2021-0414,6,digital finance and fintech play three core roles in relation to achieving the sdgs
2021-0415,0,"the provision of credit through online lending platforms, also known as fintech credit, is an expression of a process of innovation that has increasingly affected the financial services industry since the recent financial crisis"
2021-0415,1,"the fintech credit market is innovative in that, through web-based platforms, it offers borrowers and lenders cash opportunities and the possibility of gaining interest rates outside mainstream financial services providers"
2021-0415,2,this chapter provides an account of the growth of the fintech credit industry since its rise in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis
2021-0415,3,"in so doing, it reviews the evolution of some lending platforms from disintermediated to re-intermediated actors, and the implications of this process for their co-existence with traditional intermediaries in the financial services domain"
2021-0415,4,"by also focusing on the current covid-19 pandemic crisis, we consider the platforms view of their growth as a possibility of standing on equal footing with traditional financial intermediaries and the regulator view (particularly in the uk) of fintech credit as a business model that still needs to gain trust to be recognised as a valid alternative to others"
2021-0416,0,this chapter explores the analytical lens beyond the common preoccupation with the piecemeal revision of specific legal rules that do not map neatly onto fintech developments
2021-0416,1,"it argues that fintech is a fundamentally systemic regulatory challenge, a macro-level force disrupting the currently dominant technocratic paradigm of modern financial regulation"
2021-0416,2,the chapter discusses the inherent inability of the existing technocratic regulatory model to accommodate these systemic changes and outlines the core changes in the underlying philosophy of financial regulation necessary in order to meet the fintech challenge
2021-0416,3,a sustained inquiry into the systemic meaning and impact of fintech as a regulatory phenomenon must start with an analysis of the defining features of the current system of financial regulation
2021-0416,4,fintech is fundamentally changing the way financial services are delivered and transactions are conducted
2021-0416,5,fintech innovations are also broadening the menu of financial services and products
2021-0417,0,"this chapter examines the digitisation, disintermediation and datafication of consumer credit markets - a phenomenon described as fintech credit - and the implications of this phenomenon for the functioning and regulation of consumer credit markets, focusing on the challenges for consumer financial protection"
2021-0418,0,the electronic payments system is among recent service innovations that have transformed access to finance in developing and emerging economies
2021-0418,1,"this paper analyses and forecasts the diffusions of four major electronic payment technologies in nigeria, namely, atm, pos, mobile and web payments"
2021-0418,2,diffusion was measured by the volume of financial payments transacted on these technologies
2021-0418,3,"first, we applied two growth models to evaluate the diffusion and to forecast the future trajectories of these payment technologies"
2021-0418,4,"second, we applied the logistics substitution model to evaluate how these technologies compete in the nigerian payments market"
2021-0418,5,"the findings show that like many technological innovations the diffusions of electronic payment technologies are characterised by growth, maturity, saturation, and decline"
2021-0418,6,"in addition, the mobile payment system was forecast to emerge as the most diffused payment technology given the volume of financial exchange that will occur on this platform"
2021-0418,7,"these findings have implications for innovators, regulators and service providers within the nigerian payment ecosystems"
2021-0418,8,the findings also have practical implication for achieving the cashless economy and the financial inclusion projects of the nigerian state which rely on the successful diffusions of these technologies
2021-0153,0,we analyze lending by traditional as well as fintech lenders during covid-19
2021-0153,1,"comparing samples of fintech and bank loan records across the outbreak, we find that fintech companies are more likely to expand credit access to new and financially constrained borrowers after the start of the pandemic"
2021-0153,2,"however, this increased credit provision may not be sustainable"
2021-0153,3,"the delinquency rate of fintech loans triples after the outbreak, but there is no significant change in the delinquency of bank loans"
2021-0153,4,borrowers holding both loan types prioritize the payment of bank loans
2021-0153,5,these results shed light on the benefits provided by shadow banking in a crisis and hint at the potential fragility of such institutions when delinquency rates spike
2021-0419,0,"the use of technology in the financial sector has deeply transformed business models, products and services, and is affecting regulation and supervision"
2021-0419,1,"after focusing on the main current trends in fintech regulation within the eu, and on the related phenomenon of regtech, this chapter aims to explore the recent developments in suptech and to assess how the employment of technology-enabled solutions is changing the way authorities perform their functions"
2021-0419,2,"the spread of suptech could enhance supervisory capabilities while fostering a more flexible and collaborative approach towards the regulated institutions, representing a paradigm shift in the relationship between regulation and supervision"
2021-0419,3,these changes pose new challenges to the current institutional framework and to the underlying public law accountability principles
2021-0420,0,"as the global financial system evolves towards a technology-enabled financial solution-fintech, its implication to the future of the financial system becomes a policy concern"
2021-0420,1,this study investigates non-linear/inverted u-shaped fintech adoption process among a panel of 32 african countries spanning from 20022018
2021-0420,2,the study argues that fintech adoption in africa will continue to rise and not follow the inverted u-shaped process if sustained through greater trade openness
2021-0420,3,the dynamic system gmm techniques found a strong evidence for an inverted u-shaped adoption process for the 32 african markets and 24 frontier african markets but violated among the emerging (n = 3) and fragile (n = 5) groups
2021-0420,4,"the first lag of fintech compatibility and the contemporaneous levels of relative-advantage, complexity, trial-ability and observe-ability were its main determinants"
2021-0420,5,the study concludes that fintech will be replaced with new innovations in future irrespective of possible sustainability strategy
2021-0420,6,the need to strengthen african financial markets innovativeness to have a competitive edge on fintechs replacement is stressed
2021-0152,0,advances in information and communication technology (ict) have provided a platform for the introduction and diffusion of a range of financial technologies that have transformed the financial sector
2021-0152,1,this study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (fintech) and its interaction with financial inclusion and living standards (gdp per capita)
2021-0152,2,we consider the determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to gdp per capitaa fintech diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel
2021-0152,3,we specify the interactions between these two channels and their relationship with income per capita
2021-0152,4,our empirical analysis focuses on the diffusion of two enabling fintech innovations: atms and associated digital networks
2021-0152,5,and mobile phones and payments systems
2021-0152,6,"the relationships between fintech diffusion, financial inclusion and gdp per capita are estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 19912015 using both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that distinguishes short- and long-run effects"
2021-0152,7,a key finding is that fintech diffusion and financial inclusion have long-run effects on gdp per capita over and above their short-run impact and the effects of investment in fixed and human capital
2021-0151,0,constant innovations in finance and technology and different levels of their development worldwide necessitate investigating universal integrated indexes
2021-0151,1,it will enable a general assessment of the digitization of financial services and allow carrying out a comparative inter-nation analysis
2021-0151,2,"the authors proposed to evaluate the level of digitalization of financial services (dfsi) based on three components: digital inclusion, financial inclusion, and digital financial services"
2021-0151,3,the suggested approach includes several steps: 1) forming an array of input data by eight indicators
2021-0151,4,2) establishing the priority of indicators and calculating their weights by using the fishburne formula
2021-0151,5,3) calculating the integral index of digitization of financial services by using the weighted sum method
2021-0151,6,"according to the obtained dfsi values, the european countries were divided into four groups: with a high, medium, low, and critically low level of digitalization of financial services"
2021-0151,7,"countries with a high level of dfsi are considered to be denmark, the netherlands, the uk, finland, sweden, and norway"
2021-0151,8,"most countries experience low (greece, hungary, italy, croatia, portugal, poland, slovenia, slovakia, malta, lithuania) or medium (estonia, ireland, belgium, latvia, luxembourg, germany, the czech republic, france, austria, spain) levels of dfsi"
2021-0151,9,"critically low level of digitization of financial services is observed in bulgaria, and romania"
2021-0421,0,"to date, cryptocurrency prices are volatile and many cryptocurrency developers have adopted ad hoc approaches to stabilize their cryptocurrency price"
2021-0421,1,"when these currencies are not 100% backed by other valued assets, part of their price volatility may arise from self-fulfilling expectations of a speculative attack (as in obstfeld (1996))"
2021-0421,2,"we show that an exchange rate policy, which is less than 100% backed and dynamically adjusts in response to traders conversion demand eliminates speculative attacks while, under some conditions, preserving much of the desired exchange rate stability"
2021-0421,3,this dynamic exchange rate policy admits a great deal of discretion to and requires commitment by the party implementing the policy
2021-0421,4,we demonstrate how to implement this policy using the ethereum networka smart contract blockchain environmentand how this implementation yields commitment to the policy
2021-0422,0,one of the basic tenets when assessing consumer behavior is the issue that consumers are not all equal
2021-0422,1,consumers have different sets of needs and problems to solve and fintech start-ups need to identify all relevant types of consumers since a one-size-fits-all approach may not be enough to appeal to heterogeneous customers needs and problems
2021-0422,2,"this chapter analyzes the antecedents to consumers differences and advances a managerial framework not only to identify different consumers segments, but also to target relevant segments and position the fintech value proposition through targeted market strategies that attract, retain, and develop customers"
2021-0423,0,this chapter analyzes traditional and new modes of competition from the incumbents and new entrants standpoints
2021-0423,1,"up to 2008, the financial industry was considered oligopolistic in nature, but instead of the strong market power of some players, relationship among many financial players is of paramount importance for industry competition"
2021-0423,2,"this chapter shows how new fintech start-ups have managed to encroach the market, how established companies have reacted, and the subsequent strategic moves by all players oriented to implement market growth strategies"
2021-0423,3,"based on this perspective, the chapter offers a managerial framework to assess the ways big and small companies can choose and implement entry and growth strategies in fintech markets"
2021-0424,0,technology is a critical factor that leads to higher performance and sustainable competitive advantage
2021-0424,1,"however, technology alone is unable to accomplish such an objective"
2021-0424,2,"instead, scarce resources and capabilities across the organization are the foundation to develop a sustainable competitive advantage in the form of brand equity, value offering, and customer relationships"
2021-0424,3,this chapter discusses an overarching framework to assess how technologies as unique resources can help exploit opportunities to achieve sustainable competitive advantages
2021-0424,4,the vrio framework enables managers to assess a number of dimensions of resources that make them unique to better positioning in the marketplace
2021-0424,5,"this chapter discusses how firms can develop dynamic capabilities to sense, seize, and take advantage of market and technology opportunities along with a survey of suitable technologies for fintech"
2021-0425,0,"this chapter introduces fintech as an ecosystem that exists at the intersection of entrepreneurship, finance, and technology"
2021-0425,1,"as a new industry that started as a consequence of the financial crisis in 2008, fintech started by addressing unattended market segments to encroach the financial industry"
2021-0425,2,"while the financial industry is still dominated by big corporations and as fintech small companies started to grow, the competitive dynamics has changed to reflect issues of competition and collaboration"
2021-0425,3,an entrepreneurial mindset has been therefore critical to innovation of financial products
2021-0425,4,"while many technologies amenable to fintech entrepreneurs abound, more relevant is how these technologies deliver value to financial consumers"
2021-0425,5,actors in the fintech ecosystem go beyond the traditional supplierconsumer relationship and a new full line of fintech products is available
2021-0426,0,"the previous chapters have discussed several issues of financial companiesincumbents and startups, as well as topics on financial consumers and customers"
2021-0426,1,"whether the fintech can be considered an incremental or radical innovation, the implications are clear in that a complete industry has mutated after the financial crisis of 2008 that permeated many countries around the world"
2021-0426,2,this crisis was the first symptom of the wider impact of fintech on the society at large
2021-0426,3,"by broadening the perspective beyond the business realm, this chapter analyzes the impact of the fintech ecosystem on societal issues"
2021-0426,4,challenges and pending issues to address are also discussed to understand critical understanding of the financial problems that arise and managers can pose and provide contributions to society
2021-0427,0,this chapter introduces the fundamental pillars of innovation to frame product development
2021-0427,1,"fintech innovative financial products, services, and business models have been enabled not only by recent technologies and innovation methodologies"
2021-0427,2,"innovation is a broad term to refer to new products and this chapter discusses taxonomy as an aid to managers to conceptualize and map products in the market, given that each type of innovation calls for a different business model"
2021-0427,3,concepts of incremental and radical innovations and contemporary frameworks of open innovation are discussed
2021-0427,4,entrepreneurial innovation is a source of innovation in fintech traditional players in the financial industry to streamline the entrepreneurial stages of exploration and exploitation of opportunities
2021-0427,5,"finally, a valuation model to frame a fintech start-up as a financial option is presented"
2021-0428,0,"with american families living on the financial edge and seeking out high-cost loans even before covid-19, the term financial technology or fintech has been used like an incantation aimed at remedying everything thats wrong with americas financial system"
2021-0428,1,scholars and supporters from both the public and private sector proclaim that innovations in financial technology will bank the unbanked and open new channels to affordable credit
2021-0428,2,"this exuberance for all things tech in finance has led to a quiet yet aggressive deregulatory agenda, including, as of late, a federal assault via rulemaking on the ability of states to police the cost and privilege of extending credit within their borders"
2021-0428,3,"this deregulation and the ethos behind it have made space for growth in high-cost, predatory lending that reaches across state lines via websites and smart phones and aggressively targets cash-strapped families"
2021-0428,4,these loans are made using a business model whereby funds are funneled through a group of lightly regulated banks in a way designed to take advantage of federal preemption
2021-0428,5,"fintech companies rent out and profit from the special legal status of these bank partners, which in turn keeps the banks involvement in the shadows"
2021-0428,6,"stripping down predatory fintechs practices and showing them for what they really are, this article situates fintech in the context of this countrys longstanding dual banking wars, both between states and the federal government and between consumer advocates and banking regulators"
2021-0428,7,and it points the way forward for scholars and regulators willing to shake off fintechs hypnotic effect
2021-0428,8,"this means, in the short term, using existing regulatory tools to curtail the dangerous lending identified here, including by taking a more expansive view of what it means for a bank to operate safely and soundly under the law"
2021-0428,9,"in the long term, it means having a more comprehensive and national discussion about how we regulate household credit in the digital age, specifically through the convening of a twenty-first century commission on consumer finance"
2021-0428,10,the article explains how and why the time is ripe to do both
2021-0428,11,"as the current pandemic wipes out wages and decimates savings, leaving desperate families turning to predatory fintech finance ever more, the need for reform has never been greater"
2021-0429,0,"this chapter wraps up features of fintech industryits products, services, strategies, and consumers and introduces a framework to conceptualize how fintech will evolve in the future"
2021-0429,1,"scenario planning has been the standard planning tool to prospect changes in markets, industries, and social dimensions of life"
2021-0429,2,"while this prospective technique is useful to foresee long-term changes, the heterogeneous social and technical features of fintech require a broader framework to encompass all participants, processes and routines, technological devices, and their complex web of interrelationships to provide managers with a broad picture on how all these components interact in layers of diffuse borders and cross-border flows of knowledge"
2021-0429,3,"drawing on the theory of assemblage, a prospective framework is advanced and applied to fintech to gain insights on long-term changes"
2021-0430,0,this paper explores possible responses to some of the main challenges associated with conducting elite and expert interviews as part of qualitative research in human geography
2021-0430,1,"drawing on the example of the dynamic fintech industry, the paper outlines some similarities and differences between elite and expert interviews and uses this to identify and discuss possible responses"
2021-0430,2,"against this backdrop, the paper also reflects on advantages and disadvantages of using the professional social networking site linkedin as a research aid for sampling and contacting interviewees as well as for interview preparation"
2021-0430,3,the paper is anticipated to be of interest to those conducting qualitative research involving limited size sample subjects who are potentially difficult to find
2021-0430,4,"the information, practices and views in this article are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the royal geographical society (with ibg)"
2021-0038,0,the purpose of this research is to define the level of significance for various indicators that influence the degree of consumer satisfaction regarding the use of fintech technologies and services
2021-0038,1,"the most important factors that influence the level of satisfaction when using fintech services were considered: comfort and ease of use, legal regulations, ease of account opening, mobile payments features, crowdfunding options, international money transfers features, reduced costs associated with transactions, peer-to-peer lending, insurances options, online brokerage, cryptocoins options and exchange options"
2021-0038,2,"the study was conducted on a sample of 162 respondents, persons belonging to the millennials and generation z generations"
2021-0038,3,the values of the indicators for different categories of users of fintech services and different categories of generations can be determined based on the statistical tests performed and the results obtained from the regression analysis
2021-0038,4,the values of the indicators are the basic elements for determining the regression model that will help the fintech service vendors to make personalized decisions for each category of users so that the level of customer satisfaction is maximized
2021-0038,5,"the study carried out within the present article is the first of its kind for romania, because up to this moment in the specialized literature there are no such studies for eastern europe"
2021-0038,6,the research we conducted aims to fill the gap existing in the literature and responds to the expectations and needs of stakeholders in the fintechs business area
2021-0038,7,the results of the article are relevant to both stakeholders and the scientific community that is concerned about the impact of fintech technologies
2021-0431,0,purpose: this study aims to explore the perceptions of zakah institutions and the intention of society towards the application of blockchain technology in zakah management
2021-0431,1,"design/methodology/approach: the nature of this study is qualitative, attempting to indulge into the contribution of fintech in islamic social finance"
2021-0431,2,this study uses a mixed-method to gauge the perception of stakeholders
2021-0431,3,"for the quantitative approach, a survey was carried out focussing on zakah receiver and zakah payer"
2021-0431,4,the data then was analysed based on the technology acceptance model
2021-0431,5,"while interview survey with multiple stakeholders (zakah institutions, jawhar and university) was conducted to gauge the perception of zakah institutions in using blockchain technology"
2021-0431,6,"findings: the findings of this study provide a positive view for zakah institutions to embrace the usage of blockchain in its management, however, there are several concern that needs to be addressed"
2021-0431,7,practical implications: this study provides new insights to the body of knowledge especially in the zakah management system and fintech
2021-0431,8,"besides, from a managerial aspect, this study contributes to the new practices that could be implemented in zakah institutions"
2021-0431,9,"social implications: many people lose jobs and income due to the economic turmoil and covid-19 pandemic, which makes zakah an important islamic social finance tool to assist in socio-economic development"
2021-0431,10,it is high time for zakah institutions to implement blockchain especially during this pandemic crisis that requires a more contactless approach to ensure health and safety
2021-0431,11,originality/value: this study is important to encourage islamic social finance institutions to embrace blockchain technology in providing an efficient service to the development of social and economic
2021-0432,0,healthcare organizations are setting new targets of sustainable practices to improve their financial performance without depleting social and natural capital
2021-0432,1,"maintaining a sustainable, resilient, and durable healthcare system facilitate economies to achieve sustainable competitiveness"
2021-0432,2,"thus, it is important to address and fill the knowledge gap by identifying factors that improve a firms sustainability"
2021-0432,3,"drawing on technological knowledge spillover theory, this study investigates the effect of fintech development on the sustainable performance of healthcare firms using panel data comprised of 11 asia-pacific countries"
2021-0432,4,"by applying the 2-step gmm technique, we find a robust estimate that digital financial technologies improve the sustainable performance of the firms"
2021-0432,5,"contrary to the substitution effect, our results further indicate that financial institutions are collaborating with fintechs to facilitate financing at the individual and firm-level"
2021-0432,6,we also find that financial and ict development positively moderates the relationship between fintech development and sustainable performance
2021-0433,0,the role of software architecture in large-scale agile development is important because several teams need to work together to release a single software product while helping to maximise teams autonomy
2021-0433,1,"governing and aligning agile architecture across autonomous squads (i.e., teams), when using the spotify model, is a challenge because the spotify model lacks practices for addressing agile architecture governance"
2021-0433,2,"to explore how software architecture can be governed and aligned by scaling the spotify model, we conducted a longitudinal embedded case study in a multinational fintech organisation"
2021-0433,3,"then, we developed and evaluated an approach for architectural governance by conducting an embedded case study"
2021-0433,4,"the collected data was analysed using thematic analysis and informed by selected grounded theory techniques such as memoing, open coding, constant comparison, and sorting"
2021-0433,5,our approach for architectural governance comprises an organisational structure change and an architecture change management process
2021-0433,6,"the benefits reported by the practitioners include devolving architectural decision-making to the operational level (i.e., architecture owners), enhancing architectural knowledge sharing among squads, minimising wasted effort in architectural refactoring, and other benefits"
2021-0433,7,the practitioners in our case study realised an improved squad autonomy by the ability to govern and align architectural decisions
2021-0433,8,we provide two key contributions in this paper
2021-0433,9,"first, we present the characteristics of our proposed architectural governance approach, its evaluation, benefits, and challenges"
2021-0433,10,"second, we present how the novel heterogeneous tailoring model was enhanced to accommodate our architectural governance approach"
2021-0434,0,a clear trend is evolving as more and more banks and other financial institutions are being successfully sued before the civil courts of the netherlands for breaches of their special duty of care (bijzondere zorgplicht)
2021-0434,1,"whereas it was initially mainly banks that had reason to worry about claims for damages based on a breach of the special duty of care, other financial institutions too are now having to take the possibility of such claims very seriously"
2021-0434,2,another factor is that the special duty of care owed by financial institutions now seems to apply not only in their dealings with retail clients but also in relation to non-retail clients that need protection
2021-0434,3,"the author discusses the main developments relating to the special duty of care, leading to a consideration of how things may evolve in the future"
2021-0435,0,"the aim of this paper is to review previous research on fintech, which may be broadly understood as financial innovation that uses information technology to provide financial services"
2021-0435,1,the paper describes a review of 88 refereed academic papers on the subject of fintech published in journals that have high sjr2017 scores
2021-0435,2,papers were categorised according to the type of companies leveraging fintech (existing financial institutions vs
2021-0435,3,new entrants) and the type of value derived from fintech innovation (new value-added vs
2021-0435,4,improved efficiency)
2021-0435,5,"also considered were types of new value-added, geographical focus of the research and research methodologies"
2021-0435,6,the largest number of studies concerned the use of fintech innovation by new entrants to offer solutions to social issues or build new financial ecosystems
2021-0435,7,"over half the studies were on fintech in asia or the european union, and the most common methodology employed was the case study"
2021-0435,8,copyright
2021-0436,0,this paper investigates the effect of banks' investment in fintech firms (ftf) on stock returns
2021-0436,1,"we hand-collect data on 581 investment rounds made by ftfs, within at least one european or north american bank acting as investor"
2021-0436,2,our results show that banks investment in fintech affect stock markets
2021-0436,3,"the abnormal reaction is negative, larger for young and technology-oriented firms, and stronger in the case of multiple investments"
2021-0436,4,"bank size, leverage and profitability do not moderate abnormal returns"
2021-0436,5,"overall, our study suggests that bank equity investment in ftfs is an important determinant of abnormal stock returns"
2021-0437,0,the fintech index has been more active in the stock market with the fintech industry expanding
2021-0437,1,the prediction of the fintech index is significant as it is capable of instructing investors to avoid risks and provide guidance for financial regulators
2021-0437,2,traditional prediction methods adopt the deep neural network (dnn) or the combination of genetic algorithm (ga) and dnn mostly
2021-0437,3,"however, heavy computational load is required by these algorithms"
2021-0437,4,"in this paper, we propose an integrated artificial intelligence-based algorithm, consisting of the random frog algorithm (rf), ga, and dnn, to predict the fintech index"
2021-0437,5,the proposed rf-ga-dnn prediction algorithm filters the key input variables and optimizes the hyperparameters of dnn
2021-0437,6,we compare the proposed rf-ga-dnn with the traditional ga-dnn in terms of convergence time and prediction accuracy
2021-0437,7,results show that the convergence time of ga-dnn is up to 20 hours and its prediction accuracy is 97.4%
2021-0437,8,"in comparison, the convergence time of our rf-ga-dnn is only about 1.5 hours and the prediction accuracy reaches 97.0%"
2021-0437,9,these results demonstrate that the proposed rf-ga-dnn prediction algorithm significantly reduces the convergence time with the promise of competitive prediction accuracy
2021-0437,10,"thus, the proposed algorithm deserves to be widely recommended for predicting the fintech index"
2021-0150,0,purpose: the uk authority published its first regulatory guidance on crypto-assets in july 2019
2021-0150,1,this paper aims to critically evaluate the effectiveness of the crypto-asset regulation in the uk and the consistency of the existing regulatory scheme
2021-0150,2,design/methodology/approach: this paper adopts comparative methods to carry out the analysis
2021-0150,3,the paper begins by elaborating the development of crypto-assets alongside the financial innovation in the world and pinpointing the core acts and regulations applied to crypto-assets in the uk
2021-0150,4,the paper also discusses a court case in the eu to highlight an argument among legal professions concerning crypto-assets classification
2021-0150,5,"findings: through carefully analysing relevant primary and secondary legislation of the uk and eu, this paper identifies some unclarified issues in the regulatory framework and discovers three flaws in the regulatory system"
2021-0150,6,the paper concludes that the effectiveness of the current regulatory scheme is poor and room for improvement exists
2021-0150,7,originality/value: the paper provides the first review and a thorough analysis of the laws and acts applied to the crypto-asset regulation in the uk
2021-0150,8,it also calls on a simpler and clearer regulatory scheme from the perspectives of market participants and consumers
2021-0150,9,the discovered issues in the crypto-asset regulation in the uk may urge authorities to improve the existing regulatory frameworks and legal provisions

2021-0149,1,fair-lending law prohibits lenders from making credit determinations that disparately affect minority borrowers if those determinations are based on characteristics unrelated to creditworthiness
2021-0149,2,"using an identification under this rule, we show risk-equivalent latinx/black borrowers pay significantly higher interest rates on gse-securitized and fha-insured loans, particularly in high-minority-share neighborhoods"
2021-0149,3,we estimate these rate differences cost minority borrowers over $450 million yearly
2021-0149,4,"fintech lenders rate disparities were similar to those of non-fintech lenders for gse mortgages, but lower for fha mortgages issued in 20092015 and for fha refi mortgages issued in 20182019"
2021-0438,0,"fintech is an active area of innovation and a rapidly growing sector of the economy, yet relatively little is known about how information technology contributes to innovation in fintech"
2021-0438,1,we draw on the business model canvas framework and we examine the role of information technology in the business models of leading european fintech startups
2021-0438,2,"we find that information technology plays a key role across nearly all components of the fintech business models that we reviewed, orchestrating resources and processes to efficiently deliver personalized financial services to customers"
2021-0438,3,"focusing on the it-enabled value propositions across the fintech startups in our sample, we find that the startups tend to emphasize low-cost offerings that may pose a threat to incumbent business models in financial services"
2021-0148,0,"in the current study, we examine why peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platforms play only a minor role in the finance industry in israel, compared to the traditional banking system"
2021-0148,1,we conducted two studies and attempted to discover if a discrepancy exists between the lenders' preferences and the platforms incentives
2021-0148,2,"in the first study, we conducted a conjoint analysis to examine the impact of lenders' decisions to invest through p2p platforms"
2021-0148,3,the second study examines the factors in which platforms use to determine the lending interest rate for loans
2021-0148,4,"we found that although lenders wish to decrease their risk and guarantee their investment, p2p companies encourage riskier borrowers"
2021-0148,5,this contradiction between the priorities of the lenders and those of the platforms may explain why the non-users consider p2p lending to be a high risk
2021-0148,6,we offer several suggestions to increase the attractiveness of the fintech and lending platforms industry
2021-0439,0,bitcoin is the worlds first cryptocurrency which has largest market capitalization
2021-0439,1,"the study aims to analyze the risk measures for the bitcoin and comparing with tradable asset classes that include the standard and poors bse 500, usd, euro, gbp and the gold future prices"
2021-0439,2,the study uses the garch models to identify the components of world economies that bitcoin is sensitive too as against variables that impact the global financial prudence
2021-0439,3,the empirical results of the study reveal that against dollar and euro exchange rates bitcoin returns are more sensitive
2021-0439,4,bitcoin can be used together with gold to diversify or eliminate explicit market risks
2021-0439,5,the study presents reasonable justification over the development and relationship between bitcoin and different traded assets that pose new challenges before the global investors
2021-0439,6,the implication of this paper for the strategic policy makers shows the sensitivity among tradeable assets
2021-0439,7,copyright
2021-0440,0,the article deals with the protection of consumer borrowers and lending investors in peer-to-peer lending within the legal framework provided by eu credit laws
2021-0440,1,this is the legal framework for eu member states in the area of loans to consumers
2021-0440,2,"in particular, the article analyses the business model of taking lending decisions on financial technologies (""fintech"") and big data vis-a-vis the legal obligation of the creditworthiness assessment by lenders"
2021-0440,3,"at the same time, it extends the applicability of such a business model to the credit-risk analysis undertaken in the interest of lenders"
2021-0440,4,"ultimately, it questions to what extent eu law caters for peer-to-peer lending, and and to what extent consumers and lenders can find protection"
2021-0440,5,"it hints that peer-to-peer lending presents risks for both consumers and lenders, falling short of legal obligations and established practices for their protection"
2021-0147,0,"the optimal design of a central bank digital currency (cbdc) is analyzed in an environment where agents sort into cash, cbdc, and bank deposits according to their preferences over anonymity and security"
2021-0147,1,and where network effects make the convenience of a payment instrument depend on the number of its users
2021-0147,2,"a cbdc can be designed with attributes similar to cash or deposits, and can be interest bearing: a cbdc that closely competes with deposits depresses bank credit and output, while a cash-like cbdc may lead to the disappearance of cash"
2021-0147,3,"then, the optimal cbdc design trades off bank intermediation against the social value of maintaining diverse payment instruments"
2021-0147,4,"when network effects matter, an interest-bearing cbdc alleviates the central bank's tradeoff"
2021-0441,0,"building on critical approaches that understand algorithms in terms of communication, culture and organization, this paper offers the supplementary conceptualization of algorithms as organizational figuration, defined as material and meaningful sociotechnical arrangements that develop in spatiotemporal processes and are shaped by multiple enactments of affordanceagency relations"
2021-0441,1,we develop this conceptualization through a case study of a danish fintech start-up that uses machine learning to create opportunities for sustainable pensions investments
2021-0441,2,"by way of ethnographic and literary methodology, we provide an in-depth analysis of the dynamic trajectory in and through which the organization gives shape to and takes shape from its key algorithmic tool, mapping the shifting sociotechnical arrangements of the start-up, from its initial search for a viable business model through the development of the algorithm to the public launch of its product"
2021-0441,3,"on this basis, we argue that conceptualizing algorithms as organizational figuration enables us to detail not only what algorithms do but also what they are"
2021-0146,0,we report the results of a longitudinal intervention with students across five universities in china designed to reduce online consumer debt
2021-0146,1,"we allocate participants to either a financial literacy treatment group, a self-control treatment group, or a zero-touch control group"
2021-0146,2,"our self-control training intervention features detailed tracking of spending and borrowing, budgeting, and introspection about consumption choices"
2021-0146,3,"this intervention reduces online borrowing and delinquency charges, mainly driven by a reduction in entertainment-related spending and borrowing"
2021-0146,4,"in contrast, financial literacy interventions improve test scores but only marginally affect borrowing"
2021-0146,5,our results suggest that cultivating self-regulation and budgeting skills can improve borrowing behavior on e-commerce platforms
2021-0442,0,"in this article, we design a robo-advisor which has a bi-level framework"
2021-0442,1,the framework enables it to handle a large amount of assets using fast algorithms in the lower level
2021-0442,2,the proposed robo-advisor can utilize the closed-form solutions for investors risk preferences based on corresponding portfolio choices
2021-0442,3,a dynamic weight is applied to update investors risk preferences
2021-0442,4,numerical results based on real data in chinese stock market show that our proposed robo-advisor can accurately estimate the risk preferences of investors and outperform the benchmark formed by market indexes
2021-0443,0,"when it comes to asset allocation and portfolio management, kelly criterion is a mathematical formula used to optimise expected log-returns over the long term"
2021-0443,1,"nonetheless, not all stocks are well suited for analysis using kelly criterion, due to their transient nature and noisy data"
2021-0443,2,this paper presents an innovative index by which to assess the suitability of stocks for analysis using the kelly criterion
2021-0443,3,"when applied to real-world stock data, the correlation coefficient between the proposed ksi and log-returns based on the kelly criterion was (formula presented.) with a (formula presented.) -value of (formula presented.)"
2021-0443,4,"in a robustness test based on the mid-cap 100 dataset, the correlation coefficient was (formula presented.) with a (formula presented.) -value of (formula presented.)"
2021-0443,5,the results demonstrate the efficacy of the ksi for portfolio management
2021-0444,0,"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to study the current state of the russian banking system in the context of digital economy development, to establish and identify the benchmarks and needs of legal regulation, to study the potential possibilities of digitalization of relations in the banking sector in the mechanism of implementing prudential rules"
2021-0444,1,"design/methodology/approach: using the method of political and legal analysis used in this study, the legal guidelines for the digitalization of the banking sector and the financial services market have been determined, which in the russian legal system are strategic planning documents"
2021-0444,2,"findings: international research in the field of banking indicates that digitalization and globalization of the economy stimulate the processes of international regulatory cooperation and harmonization of legislation, the use of new approaches in the development and adoption of regulations in the financial market"
2021-0444,3,"the growth of digitalization of relations in the banking sector will contribute to the effective implementation of prudential rules, including those related to the need to protect public interests"
2021-0444,4,"originality/value: the study revealed a number of issues related to the digitalization of the activities of credit institutions that are professional participants in the securities market and the central bank as a financial mega-regulator, requiring a legal solution"
2021-0444,5,measures aimed at improving the current legislation and procedures of state regulation and supervision are proposed
2021-0445,0,"purpose: starting from the state-of-the-art of fintech development, this study aims to propose some research propositions comparing reward-crowdfunding (rcf) and equity-crowdfunding (ecf)"
2021-0445,1,"in this sense, the present research provides a comprehensive analysis of fintech development and  to conceptualize the comparison between rcf and ecf  it focuses on campaigns characteristics, aims and post-campaigns scenarios"
2021-0445,2,design/methodology/approach: all the research propositions related to the comparison between rcf and ecf are rooted in dedicated literature
2021-0445,3,the methodological approach adopted in the present paper can be referred to theorizing
2021-0445,4,"findings: this study suggests that five key elements characterize the development of fintech: regulation, infrastructure, technologies, finance and innovations"
2021-0445,5,the research provides nine propositions: four related to the campaigns characteristics
2021-0445,6,two related to the use of crowdfunding models by entrepreneurs
2021-0445,7,and three related to the performance of crowdfunded companies
2021-0445,8,"practical implications: by offering nine research propositions, this study is expected to foster and support the investigation of fintech development from an entrepreneurial and managerial point of view"
2021-0445,9,"originality/value: to the best of authors knowledge, this study is among the first to explore the fintech development and to propose a comparative approach between rcf and ecf"
2021-0445,10,this research contributes to the current debate on fintech development as well as on the comparison between crowdfunding models
2021-0446,0,"the paper is devoted to reviewing trends of financial market development, mainly the use of digital financial technologies"
2021-0446,1,"we note that the development of the russian financial market is one of the priorities of the central bank of the russian federation, where modern digital activities are is a special factor of the development"
2021-0446,2,"the use of new technologies contributes to the decentralization of the financial system, which has both positive aspects and the risks of global financial instability"
2021-0446,3,"the content of the paper describes the problems of russian financial startups, mainly the use of blockchains in banking, near field communication, p2p lending, b2b sales, and big data cloud services"
2021-0446,4,the paper notes that the current financial market is marked with actively functioning neobanks established by financial organizations specializing in e-commerce generally operating only through the internet without offices
2021-0446,5,the paper concludes that the use of digital financial technologies is the main necessary factor for the development of the financial market
2021-0447,0,the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the financial technology (fintech) services provided by banks on their performance
2021-0447,1,we also investigate the influence of fintech firms growth (as competitor firms) on banks financial performance
2021-0447,2,"we extend our analysis to investigate the differences between conventional banks (cbs) and islamic banks (ibs) in this relationship and utilise a sample of 40 listed banks from gulf cooperation countries, where fintech growth was impressive in the period 20142019"
2021-0447,3,we find a negative relationship between fintech services and bank performance for both types of bank
2021-0447,4,"furthermore, we show that the growth of fintech firms in a country negatively influences cbs financial performance but has no significant impact on ibs performance"
2021-0447,5,"in addition, we test our hypotheses through multiple additional tests and robustness tests, such as the generalised method of moments"
2021-0447,6,"the findings could be relevant to banks, policy makers, and academic research"
2021-0448,0,"google, apple, facebook and amazon (the gafas) have been slow to disrupt the financial services sector, but they are likely to do so in the coming years by using their control of important customer access points such as mobile operating systems, search engines, app stores, and marketplaces"
2021-0448,1,this paper discusses these issues in the context of competition law enforcement and the emerging uk and eu regulatory regimes aiming to curb the gafas market power
2021-0448,2,the new rules can ensure that consumers will benefit from the innovations of the gafas and others without suffering the long-run effects of their further accumulation of market power
2021-0448,3,"the new rules can ensure that the gafas do not benefit from an asymmetry of regulatory obligations compared to their financial services competitors, and that the gafas cannot leverage their market power from core activities into financial services whereby their financial services competitors are hindered in reacting"
2021-0449,0,fintechs have gained strong momentum in recent years showing high growth rates and very significant turnover
2021-0449,1,"agile, differentiated and technological services, including credit cards, are successfully facing traditional banking services"
2021-0449,2,"in this article, a case study in the brazilian financial market, system dynamics simulates the adoption of technology and products of these new banking services"
2021-0449,3,"the modeling adopts regulatory parameters of the central bank of brazil, regarding customer portfolio, credit portfolio of the revolving revenue, credit loss provisioning, and default rate"
2021-0449,4,the focus is mapping credit risk dynamics in brazilian markets to support decision of managers and investors
2021-0449,5,"the results, obtained from the simulations, showed positive and growing profits when we use variables with similar values to those of the current scenario"
2021-0449,6,"additionally, action on interest rates on revolving credit rates affects the profitability of these projects"
2021-0449,7,the presented system can be used to support investment evaluation and or managers decision in this area
2021-0145,0,fintech innovations are rapidly transforming the global financial industry and easing the financial inclusion initiatives of microfinance institutions (mfis)
2021-0145,1,such technological transformations are expected to promote stability in the financial system and in turn reduce the risk-taking behavior of its main actors
2021-0145,2,"however, there is limited or no empirical evidence to confirm the impact of fintech-based financial inclusion (finfi) on the risk-taking behavior of sub-saharan african mfis"
2021-0145,3,"thus, we have developed a new index to measure finfi and empirically assess its role in reducing the risk-taking attitude of mfis"
2021-0145,4,the validity of our results was confirmed by using various robustness tests
2021-0450,0,financial technology or what is so-called fintech is one of the prominent sectors that have been introduced by the fourth industrial revolution at the beginning of the second millennium
2021-0450,1,"the fintech sector is providing a variety of innovative digitized financial activities in the aims of improving and facilitating traditional financial services as they are often faster, cheaper, easier to access"
2021-0450,2,"the rise and development of fintech sector in todays world is playing a crucial role in increasing the financial inclusion levels among individuals as well as among businesses, especially the micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes)"
2021-0450,3,higher financial exclusion has a major negative impact on poverty and income distribution in societies
2021-0450,4,"about 2.5 billion people and over 200 million businesses are still excluded from the formal financial system which is restraining economic growth, job creation and employment opportunities [13]"
2021-0450,5,"similarly, in india, the figures of the unbanked population counted for 190 million adults without a bank account [13]"
2021-0450,6,"for a population size of more than 98 million people, 77% of adults in egypt are not having a formal bank account [30]"
2021-0450,7,the main objective of this study is to understand how the digitization of financial services can play a major role in increasing inclusive growth and entrepreneurship with a special emphasis on the indian and egyptian cases
2021-0450,8,this study is based on a theoretical and conceptual framework
2021-0450,9,"the study examines various archival, reports of national and international organizations"
2021-0450,10,the findings of the study are showing that the fintech sector is having immense opportunities for enhancing entrepreneurship and economic growth in developing countries
2021-0450,11,the fintech sector in egypt is still new but rapidly expanding
2021-0450,12,"in comparison with the successful indian experience, the digital financial ecosystem in egypt is facing a major shortfall"
2021-0451,0,the aim of current study is to investigate the impact of financial technology on the performance of bahraini banks
2021-0451,1,"the results indicates that the total level of applying financial technology by bahraini banks was 70.51%, and it has a significant positive relationship with the financial performance"

2021-0144,0,"using the credit records of the borrowers from a peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platform in china, this paper finds that p2p borrowers from cities with broader coverage of formal finance are more likely to default"
2021-0144,1,"moreover, as formal finance develops, high-quality borrowers become less likely to turn to p2p lending, which suggests that formal finance exerts a crowding-out effect on the p2p lending market"
2021-0144,2,"this paper provides an explanation for the failure of china's p2p lending industry, implying that fintech intended to promote financial coverage, if not reducing information asymmetry, does not necessarily lead to desirable economic and social outcomes"
2021-0452,0,-the research empirically examines effect of mergers and acquisitions on corporate financial success of quoted insurance companies in nigeria
2021-0452,1,it has become expedient in the face of the drastic increase in mergers and acquisitions activity in recent decades and the fact that there has been very little empirical evidence of positive wealth effects and particularly the success of m&a in the insurance sector
2021-0452,2,this has arisen because most studies in nigeria have rather focused on the banking sector
2021-0452,3,data was obtained from quoted insurance companies from 2003 to 2016 and the regression techniques were employed in the study
2021-0452,4,the result indicated that there exists a positive effect of m&a on corporate financial performance of insurance companies
2021-0452,5,it revealed that a unit increase in merger led to about 4% increase in the corporate financial performance of the merged firms
2021-0452,6,"in effect, a unit increase in earnings after merger actually led to about 8% increase in the corporate financial performance of the same firms"
2021-0452,7,"the study hereby recommend that insurance companies should look at issues of claims settlement, product development and branding while the national insurance commission (naicom) should look into the education of insurable clients as well as appropriate polices that would drive insurance penetration in nigeria"
2021-0453,0,the peer to peer lending financial technology corporation as a digital-based intermediary has two types of agency relationships: (1) between financial technology corporation as an agent with investors as a principal
2021-0453,1,(2) between financial technology corporation as an agent and the small-medium enterprises as a third party (debtors)
2021-0453,2,"both of these agency relationships currently run independently and are separate from other agency relationships, so they are not effective in improving performance"
2021-0453,3,"therefore, the purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual framework of the e-integrated corporate governance model at the peer to peer lending financial technology corporation to improve sustainability performance"
2021-0453,4,"the research method in this article was reviewing articles related to corporate governance, finding gaps and limitations"
2021-0453,5,"the results of this study are that because business processes in financial technology corporations are interconnected systems, both corporate governances must be integrated with information technology, in order to improve sustainability performance"
2021-0453,6,"with this model, asymmetric information between the three parties (depositors/investors, financial technology corporation, and small-medium enterprises) and all stakeholders can be eliminated, risks can be reduced, business processes and financial and non-financial information of the three parties is more transparent and accessible for all stakeholders"
2021-0095,0,purpose: this paper aims to investigate how digital financial inclusion (dfi) can be a potential factor to maintain banking stability in association of southeast asian nations (asean) countries and whether the relationship could bring a possible implication for the post-covid-19 pandemic era
2021-0095,1,"design/methodology/approach: using an unbalanced panel data of 213 banks of 4 asean countries, the study has deployed principal component analysis, ordinary least square, two-step dynamic system generalised method of moments and panel corrected standard errors techniques"
2021-0095,2,findings: the empirical study finds that the full-fledged application of dfi accelerates the asean banking stability which not only decreases the default risk of the banks but also upturns the financial mobility in the region
2021-0095,3,"the results also suggest that asean banks are, with the implementation of dfi, likely to uphold the banking sector stability by reducing liquidity crisis and non-performing loans during and in the post-covid-19 era"
2021-0095,4,"therefore, accelerating digital finance in asean countries is considered as one of the significant means for the banking sector stability that subsequently leads to economic and financial resilience even in the face of any crises"
2021-0095,5,originality/value: prevailing studies have mostly investigated the association between financial inclusion and banking stability in different contexts
2021-0095,6,"however, this study is unique to empirically investigate the association between dfi and the asean banking stability"
2021-0454,0,"financial technology is one of the fields that has recently appeared in the finance and banking sector, and it has become imperative for the concerned sectors in all countries of the world to keep pace with this development"

2021-0454,2,"it also aimed to identify the reality of financial technology in the arab world, and the most important emerging projects in this field, available opportunities and challenges"
2021-0454,3,"one of the most important findings of this study that financial technology is a sector newly established which it would provide all kinds of traditional financial services but in a different style and shape more sophisticated, speedy and accurate"
2021-0454,4,"it has also been concluded that the countries of the world have made great strides in this field despite its recentness, while the use of financial technology and its volume of transactions in the arab world is still modest when compared to the developed countries in the world despite development of the future strategies, electronic payment, and electronic commerce that arab countries put in place for economic diversification make them encourage the establishment of financial technology in their economies"
2021-0454,5,"the arab world should take advantage of the available opportunities and face the challenges facing the application of this technology, especially the development of modern regulatory legislation that would create a business environment that supports the economy in general"
2021-0455,0,the financial stability board defines financial technology (fintech) as technology-enabled innovation in financial services
2021-0455,1,"at the 2015 world economic forum, experts proposed a taxonomy for financial services that can be classified into six major categories: payments, deposits and lending, market provisioning, capital raising, insurance, and investment management"
2021-0455,2,"because financial opinion mining can be applied to many listed services, we survey various cases in this chapter and show that financial opinion mining is useful and crucial in many financial application scenarios"
2021-0142,0,"purpose: this study aims to explore the challenges and prospects of using e-wallets in malaysia, and what it means for businesses and customers"

2021-0142,4,it is supported with findings from the literature and secondary data
2021-0142,5,the relevant secondary data were collected from bank negara malaysia and the world bank
2021-0142,6,findings: this study shows that e-wallets in malaysia have still not achieved their purpose but there is huge potential to do so
2021-0142,7,the swot analysis identified several strengths (e.g
2021-0142,8,"financial incorporation, easy to access, protection and safety, simple for other accounts to connect to, product and consumer service management, quick to implement/administer), weaknesses (e.g"
2021-0142,9,"lack of infrastructure and the tapping of devices already cornered by the mobile phone market, opportunities (e.g"
2021-0142,10,"eliminating fraud, better customer service, promotion/loyalty that can be built into customer experience) and threats (e.g"
2021-0142,11,"attacks from viruses, frequent inquiries whether multiple wallets can be used by clients, the concerns of reckless spending behaviour of the e-wallet users)"
2021-0142,12,research limitations/implications: this study is crucial for assessing the current situation and the prospects of e-wallets in malaysia
2021-0142,13,this study also offers significant insights for policymakers and e-wallet service providers to develop appropriate strategies to enhance e-wallet services in malaysia
2021-0142,14,originality/value: this paper is the first of its kind to integrate a swot analysis and the rapid development of the e-wallet market in malaysia
2021-0142,15,"hence, the findings could broaden our knowledge on the fintech industry and enable firms to participate in the e-wallet market"
2021-0456,0,digital finance has changed the landscape of financial service provision worldwide
2021-0456,1,"china in particular, with a booming fintech sector and large numbers of users, is at the forefront of the expansion of digital financial services"
2021-0456,2,"as such, the country has become an important case for better understanding how fintech operates and what its expansion entails for socioeconomic development"
2021-0456,3,this paper focuses on the provision of new models of digital finance in rural china by two internet giantsjd and alibaba
2021-0456,4,"against the backdrop of decades of generally unsuccessful attempts to expand financial coverage in rural areas by conventional bricks-and-mortar financial institutions, these two rural fintech models have the potential to expand digital financial service provision in new ways"
2021-0456,5,"this paper critically examines these fintech models, contextualises them within the broader trajectory of pushes to expand digital financial inclusion worldwide, considers the parallels with agricultural supplier contracting systems elsewhere, and explores the potential benefits and risks that they pose for rural development and rural livelihoods in china and elsewhere"
2021-0457,0,"this study aims to examine the influence of knowledge management process on fintech innovation through the moderating role of managers demographic characteristics (age, sex, education, experience, and position) in commercial banks operating in lebanon"

2021-0047,1,"to this aim, we first find the optimal weights of the currencies that can comprise our basket"
2021-0047,2,we then employ volatility spillover decomposition methods to understand which foreign currency mostly drives the others
2021-0047,3,we then look at how the stability of either stablecoin is affected by currency shocks by means of spillover networks built on var models
2021-0047,4,our empirical findings show that our basket based stablecoin is less volatile than all single currencies
2021-0047,5,"this result is fundamental for policy making, and especially for emerging markets with a high level of remittances: a librae (basket based stablecoin) can preserve their value during turbolent times better than a libra (single currency based stablecoin)"

2021-0479,1,"in this chapter, we study the impact of financial technology on the risk and performance of commercial banks as the incumbent in the industry"
2021-0479,2,the authors combine a cross-country dataset resulting in 336 country-year observations
2021-0479,3,"the authors find that financial technology, more particular the growing of adoption in mobile money, has been considered to increase the risk of banks"
2021-0479,4,"however, the authors do not find any evidence that the performance of commercial banks has significantly eroded by the presence of financial technology"
2021-0480,0,virtual investment community has become an important information source for investors
2021-0480,1,this study contributes to the related literature by investigating the endogenous interplay between investor activity on the virtual investment community and the market trading dynamics using a vector autoregressive framework to analyze an hourly dataset collected from the bitcoin market
2021-0480,2,"the main results suggest that the sentiment and the posting frequency of virtual investment community messages are largely driven by the past market outcomes, but they provide limited value-relevant information for future price prediction"
2021-0480,3,"it is also demonstrated that when investors express conflicting opinions, or when their discussions exhibit a lack of diversity, their incentive to trade decreases, resulting in low trading volume"
2021-0480,4,theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed
2021-0481,0,we investigate the case of a microcredit platform that offers financial services in an impoverished region of brazil
2021-0481,1,"through this case, we verify how the intermediation of human microcredit agents is essential to create critical mass that guarantee engagement of potential clients"
2021-0481,2,we critically analyze the role of these agents disseminating microcredit as essential for the outreach of financial services on the edge of the traditional financial system
2021-0481,3,"on the one hand, by collecting information, as well as acting on credit recovery, those microcredit agents reduce the information asymmetry in the process of granting credit to micro-entrepreneurs"
2021-0481,4,"on the other hand, acting as brokers to a platform, their role can also be understood as an element intended to connect micro-entrepreneurs to algorithms and to constantly monitor them"
2021-0481,5,"with close relationships in the community in which they operate, microcredit agents have an expanded capacity for real-time surveillance"
2021-0482,0,alternative data in small and medium-sized enterprise (sme)-focused fintech lending has been defined as data that are gathered from non-traditional data sources and not typically included in the traditional credit process
2021-0482,1,the use of a broad variety and vast amount of structured and unstructured alternative data to mitigate information friction and augment risk management is at the heart of fintech lending
2021-0482,2,"by categorizing alternative data into different types and comparing them with traditional data, our study seeks to answer the following important questions in sme-focused fintech lending: 1) whether traditional data outperform alternative data in managing the convenience-fraud risk conflict, 2) whether traditional and alternative data are overall complements or substitutes in credit evaluation and fraud detection, and 3) how and to what extent traditional and alternative data should be combined for better credit and loan decisions"
2021-0483,0,this paper studies the impact of a policy of opening the platform's data to banks
2021-0483,1,"this makes banks in a better position to compete with the platform, and some firms benefit from cheaper loans due to increased competition of financial service"
2021-0483,2,"however, our model shows that it might harm the platform ecosystem, and small firms can no longer get loans"
2021-0483,3,"we analyze the welfare of firms under different policies, and the optimal policy for the social planner"
2021-0483,4,"in the full paper, we will study the policy implications related to the economic circumstance in greater depth, as well as how different policies affect the incentive of the platform to generate data"
2021-0484,0,"this paper focused on mobile payment technology adoption among sme owners in kanchipuram district in tamil nadu, india"
2021-0484,1,it attempted to explore the factors that affected the adoption of mobile payment technology and the intention to use it
2021-0484,2,the paper sought to identify the issues faced by the sme owners while adopting mobile payment technology for their personal and business transactions
2021-0484,3,"the data were collected using an interview schedule, and the sample comprised of 100 sme owners in the selected rural areas of kanchipuram district"
2021-0484,4,the primary data were analyzed using regression and correlation analysis
2021-0484,5,the findings revealed that the mobile payment usage enabled the sme owners to accomplish their work rapidly
2021-0484,6,"the study observed that the factors such as complexity, cost, trust, and security issues derived from perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness had a positive impact on the adoption of mobile payment technology"
2021-0484,7,the study was a novel attempt to empirically examine the factors affecting the mobile payment technology adoption in rural india
2021-0484,8,the study will be useful for the service providers to advance the critical understanding on how rural consumers can improve their technology adoption and optimize their business opportunities in the emerging market of rural india
2021-0091,0,"this paper explores the digital farmer assemblage as an illuminating case of the behavioural turn in international development, in which smallholder farmers are digitally steered towards behaviours deemed necessary for market inclusion"
2021-0091,1,central to these interventions are digital platforms that function as human technologies to craft new kinds of market subject that can be inserted into value chains and wider circuits of capital and data
2021-0091,2,"as such, they represent both a continuation of the long green revolution and a point of departure"
2021-0091,3,"the narrowing of options built into their design is likely to further erode processes of skilling central to agricultural practice, while loosening the social ties of mutuality and reciprocity in which such processes are embedded, intensifying vulnerability to climate and market uncertainties"
2021-0485,0,the financial landscape is being transformed by technological innovations
2021-0485,1,this trend can be observed clearly in the uk where fintech is developing within the context of the ongoing digitalization of the economy
2021-0485,2,this paper examines the role of the british government and regulatory authorities in sparking innovation to improve the way financial services are provided
2021-0485,3,"at the conceptual level, fintech-specific policy presumes the existence of complex trade-offs between competition, market integrity, and financial stability"
2021-0485,4,the special consideration is given to open banking initiative as a key driver of competition in financial services sector
2021-0485,5,by removing barriers to entry and grow for fintech firms the policy enablers try to solve the longstanding problems of financial exclusion
2021-0485,6,particular attention is paid to key approaches to fintech regulation
2021-0485,7,the financial conduct authority undertakes the constant review of regulatory perimeter as a means of mitigating risks to market integrity and ensuring consumer protection
2021-0485,8,the bank of england is rethinking the notion of financial stability and reviewing the approaches to managing systemic risks
2021-0485,9,the paper regards the initiatives implemented by regulatory authorities to support innovator businesses as a way to ensure the world leading position of the uks financial sector
2021-0485,10,it is argued that the supportive government policy and progressive regulation are the overriding factors of fintech development in the uk
2021-0486,0,"new technologies have been driving the global financial market, including fintech companies, which provide disruptive financial services in which information technology is the key factor"
2021-0486,1,the objective of this study is to identify which factors most influence intentions to continue using these companies products
2021-0486,2,"to achieve this, research by ryu (2018) was replicated"
2021-0486,3,our adopted model evaluates the weight of seven factors composing two latent variables  perceived risk and perceived benefit  in the continuity of use of these services
2021-0486,4,"the data collection was performed through an electronic survey, distributed through social networks during may and june of 2019"
2021-0486,5,"the main results confirmed seven of the eleven initial hypotheses, highlighting that the perceived benefits, especially the economic ones, were relevant to early adopters and seamless transactions were relevant for late adopters"
2021-0486,6,"surprisingly, perceived risk was not a determinant of continuance intention"
2021-0486,7,"one of the contributions of this study is that it indicates some possible demographic and behavioral characteristics of brazilian fintech consumers, opening up space for a better understanding of the market and service improvements"
2021-0090,0,purpose: this paper aims to assess whether the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has encouraged governments to take actions towards fostering digital means of payments and financial transactions to stimulate economic activities and achieve higher financial inclusion
2021-0090,1,"design/methodology/approach: using a logit model, this paper tests the impact of the level of income and gdp per capita, government effectiveness, digital adoption, number of commercial banks and the pandemic-related closure of business and stores due to full lockdowns on governments policy response regarding digital means of payments"
2021-0090,2,findings: the author finds that low- and lower-middle-income countries had significantly responded to the surged need for digital means of payment during the pandemic compared to the upper-middle-income and high-income countries
2021-0090,3,"the author also finds that government effectiveness and the number of commercial banks were predictors of government policy response, while the full lockdown of countries and the overall digital adoption were not"
2021-0090,4,"research limitations/implications: data of the post-covid-19 pandemic are limited, and the sample size is small"
2021-0090,5,originality/value: this is the first paper to empirically model governments' response during the pandemic to promote digital means of payments
2021-0090,6,this paper gives insight into post-crisis potential changes in digital payment adoption in the upcoming years
2021-0089,0,"novel coronavirus, also known as covid-19, is a health emergency that is having an ever-growing impact on the global economy"
2021-0089,1,covid-19 has caused economic disruption at an unprecedented speed and scale
2021-0089,2,the economic costs it will bring to society can only be measured in times to come
2021-0089,3,"millions of people across the globe have already become unemployed, and similarly, millions of businesses have either shut down or are on the verge of collapse"
2021-0089,4,it is a great challenge for policymakers to minimize the economic impact of covid-19 and put the economy on a growth trajectory once again
2021-0089,5,"unfortunately, there is so far no country in the world that can be viewed as a role model for its economic response to the covid-19 pandemic"
2021-0089,6,the present study proposes islamic finance as a potential tool to help affected economies safely pass through the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic
2021-0089,7,this study identifies a four-stage covid-19 model and proposes ten innovative islamic financial services for each stage of the pandemic
2021-0089,8,"in addition, it analyzes how these services can be effectively utilized at different stages to overcome the economic damage caused by the pandemic"
2021-0487,0,online lending through fintech firms is a rapidly expanding segment of the financial market that is receiving much atten-tion from investors and increasing scrutiny from regulators
2021-0487,1,"to assess how fintech firms entry is altering the choices and out-comes of small businesses that borrow from them, we analyze data from the federal reserves small business credit survey, a unique data source on the experiences of business owners with new and traditional sources of credit"
2021-0487,2,"we find that fin-tech lenders have substantially expanded the small business finance market by reaching borrowers less likely to be served by traditional lenders and that businesses using online lenders are younger, smaller, and less profitable than the average small or medium-sized enterprise in the united states"
2021-0487,3,"after con-trolling for compositional differences between online and bank borrowers, we find that businesses using fintech lenders gen-erally apply for smaller loan amounts but value the option of fintech loans"
2021-0487,4,businesses that receive fintech loans expect more revenue and employment growth than those receiving a bank loan
2021-0487,5,"however, they are less satisfied than businesses that borrow from banks but more satisfied than businesses that were denied credit"
2021-0041,0,financial technology have revolutionized the delivery and usage of the autonomous operations and processes to improve the financial services
2021-0041,1,"however, the massive amount of data (often called as big data) generated seamlessly across different geographic locations can end end up as a bottleneck for the underlying network infrastructure"
2021-0041,2,"to mitigate this challenge, software-defined network (sdn) has been leveraged in the proposed approach to provide scalability and resilience in multi-controller environment"
2021-0041,3,"however, in case if one of these controllers fail or cannot work as per desired requirements, then either the network load of that controller has to be migrated to another suitable controller or it has to be divided or balanced among other available controllers"
2021-0041,4,"for this purpose, the proposed approach provides an adaptive recovery mechanism in a multi-controller sdn setup using support vector machine-based classification approach"
2021-0041,5,"the proposed work defines a recovery pool based on the three vital parameters, reliability, energy, and latency"
2021-0041,6,"a utility matrix is then computed based on these parameters, on the basis of which the recovery controllers are selected"
2021-0041,7,the results obtained prove that it is able to perform well in terms of considered evaluation parameters

2021-0491,0,since the global financial crisis in 2008 regulatory measures have been taken to strengthen the international financial sector
2021-0491,1,there are however regulatory challenges that have the potential to destabilise the international financial sector
2021-0491,2,"this article examines three of these challenges: fintech, brexit, and emerging markets economies"
2021-0491,3,there is currently no significant analysis of these issues in relation to their effect on global financial stability
2021-0491,4,this article addresses this gap and analyses why these issues form a threat to financial stability
2021-0491,5,"fintech is modest but growing exponentially and there is little regulation in place, brexit is characterised by prolonged uncertainty and potentially significant negative effects on the economy, and emerging markets economies now occupy a far larger part of the international financial sector than in 2008 and their potential effects on global financial stability are also significantly stronger"
2021-0491,6,"the analysis leads to the conclusion that the common threat emerging from these challenges is policy uncertainty which leads to increased wariness from investors, which in turn leads to sudden changes in capital flows"
2021-0491,7,this can potentially affect international financial stability
2021-0491,8,to mitigate these effects a more internationally harmonised approach to policy and regulation is key
2021-0492,0,"over the recent several years, the financial sector underwent substantial changes due to development of digital financial technologies, which stimulates the increase of the opportunities of access of small and medium-sized enterprises (hereinaftersmes) and startups to financial resources by means of appearance of p2p crediting, crowdfunding, and the tools of financing based on blockchainin particular, ico"

2021-0494,5,the mena region governments and apex bodies are encouraging fintech industries to develop their businesses along with it innovation to establish a sound financial ecosystem
2021-0494,6,"as said by coo of jordans arab bank, this industry is at an earlier stage which requires lots of rules and policies to regulate this industry with the support of banks and fintech industries"
2021-0494,7,it is the crucial task for the regulators to establish technology based steady financial system which requires well established stringent rules and regulations to prevent cyber-crimes
2021-0494,8,"hence, this conceptual work attempts to understand the main aspects of fintech, role of financial institutions, attitude of stakeholders towards the new financial system, challenges and opportunities prevailing towards this industry"
2021-0494,9,this has been achieved by reviewing the existing literature to support the growth of the economy in mena region using fintech

2021-0084,2,"this line of enquiry is necessary as a majority of fintech firms are collaborating with the listed firms, and quality corporate governance is vital to protect the shareholders rights"
2021-0084,3,"fintech governance structure faces four key challenges: lack of anti-misconduct policy, ceo duality, over-boarded directors, and the inability of audit firms to detect fraud"
2021-0084,4,"organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) provides a guideline for corporate governance, suggesting that anti-misconduct policy is a sign of better governance"
2021-0084,5,the agency theory postulates that concentration of power weakens corporate governance mechanism
2021-0084,6,"thereby, ceo duality and over-boarded directors are the indicators of weak governance"
2021-0084,7,"also, the supervisory structure of fintech firms is different than counterparts, which hinder the audit firms to deduct any financial misstatement"
2021-0084,8,"based on the literature, we find that the fintech firms lack anti-bribery policy and prone to have ceo duality, over-boarded directors and audit firms failure to detect fraud"

2021-0499,1,women in kenya have limited property rights and continue to require approval from their husbands or male family members to conduct financial activities
2021-0499,2,"besides, most women are concentrated in the informal economy, which has exacerbated their level of financial exclusion since they struggle to provide the documentation that financial institutions require, thus making them more dependent on informal finance"
2021-0499,3,this paper demonstrates how mobile money has significantly decreased the proportion of women in nairobi excluded from using financial services
2021-0499,4,"drawing upon survey work conducted by the author across eight areas of nairobi, this research reveals how mobile money has enabled women to benefit from instant remittance and payment services, and has offered a means of storing money safely, which is an attribute particularly valued by younger women and those with lower levels of educational attainment and income"
2021-0499,5,"although mobile money does not address many of the structural drivers of gendered financial inequality, it has improved levels of financial inclusion by increasing womens access to various financial channels from which they were previously excluded"

2021-0106,3,the analysis of current and proposed legal regulation of experimental legal regimes is provided
2021-0106,4,findings: the research has analyzed current scientific and legislative definitions of regulatory sandboxes
2021-0106,5,"given the attributes typical for legal regimes and legal experiments, as well as available scientific definitions, an all-encompassing theoretical definition of a regulatory sandbox is provided"
2021-0106,6,potential legal discrepancies related to regulation of experimental legal regimes are demonstrated
2021-0106,7,original/value: the research is aimed at eliminating terminological confusion caused by applying a new legal concept
2021-0106,8,"besides, it proposes an all-encompassing definition of the regulatory sandbox concept than can be applied for further theoretical study of fintech testing regulation as well as for related legislative practice"
2021-0105,0,this paper reviews the growing literature on initial coin offerings (icos) and provides original evidence of the investor protection on icos from 37 countries
2021-0105,1,we show that the anti-director rights and anti-self-dealing index are positively associated with the country-level raised fund of icos after controlling for economic and culture factors
2021-0105,2,the disclosure quality and investor rights as specified in the whitepapers are generally poor and they are found to be important to raise more funds in icos
2021-0105,3,we argue that the lack of (self-) discipline poses a threat to investor protections
2021-0105,4,around 60% whitepaper do not disclose information on the use of proceeds or management team
2021-0105,5,around 80% icos do not entitle investors the rights for dividend or vote
2021-0105,6,our findings suggest the needs of regulating icos to protect investors
2021-0509,0,"technology has, to different degrees, always been part of the financial world, starting from the 1950s with the introduction of credit cards and atms, passing through electronic trading floors and personal finance apps, until present days where technologies such as artificial intelligence (ai), high-frequency trading (hft), and cryptocurrencies are widespread"
2021-0509,1,"the prominent role of technology in finance has become so important as to obtain a specific term to describe the intersection between the twothat is, fintech"
2021-0509,2,"a portmanteau of financial technology, fintech refers to the application of new technological advancements to products and services in the financial industry"

2021-0025,2,"we sample 407 registered smes with the association of ghanaian industries (agi) and employ hierarchical logistic regression models to explore the multiplicative effects of smes chief executive officers characteristics (ceoc), business characteristics (busc), and fintech payment service characteristics (fpsc) on the diffusion of fintech payment services (dfps)"
2021-0025,3,"consistent with the technology diffusion theories, the finding reveals that ceoc, busc, and fpsc altogether determines the dfps in ghanaian smes"
2021-0025,4,"thus, the combined effects of human, business, and technology actors drive the dfps in smes"
2021-0025,5,"therefore, the optimal design of fintech services is critical for mass diffusion by smes in emerging economies"

2021-0000,1,"using daily data from november 2018 to june 2020, we use both dy (diebold & yilmaz, 2012) and bk (barunik et al., 2017) to examine the volatility connectedness of returns series"
2021-0000,2,"the results of dy suggest that, first, the total connectedness of 21st century technology assets and traditional common stocks is very high, and hence in the turbulent economy, there is a high probability of contemporaneous losses"
2021-0000,3,"second, bitcoin, msciw, msci us, and kftx are net contributors of volatility shocks whereas us dollar, oil, gold, vix, green bond and green bond select are net receivers"
2021-0000,4,"therefore, fintech and common equities are not good hedging instruments in the same portfolio"
2021-0000,5,"third, the short-term witnesses higher volatility transmission than the long-term"
2021-0000,6,"that is, holding assets for a long-term is likely to mitigate risks whereas trading financial assets in the short-term can increase risk because of higher volatility"
2021-0000,7,"fourth, the traditional assets, gold and oil, as well as modern assets, green bonds, are useful as good hedgers compared with other assets because shock transmissions from them to fintech, kftx are below 0.1% and, more importantly, the total volatility spill-over of all assets in the sample is moderately average, accounting for 44.39%"
2021-0102,0,this paper constructs a panel smooth transition vector autoregressive model with a financial technology index (fti) as a transition variable to explore the causality between inbound tourism and economic growth in 22 oecd countries
2021-0102,1,"the model resolves the estimation problems of nonlinearity, heterogeneity, and endogeneity"
2021-0102,2,"the empirical results support that the causality is nonlinear, bidirectional, and time- and country-varying, depending on each countrys fti in each period"
2021-0102,3,"under most ftis, the current inbound tourism growth will crowd out the economic growth in the next period"
2021-0102,4,"when the fti is higher than the threshold (81.27), the current economic growth will harm inbound tourism growth in the next period"
2021-0102,5,"for oecd countries with an fti below the threshold (81.27), tourism companies should actively expand their investment to share the tourism dividend driven from the economic growth in the previous period"
2021-0102,6,"for oecd countries with an fti above the threshold, the governments should adopt appropriate policies to reduce the impact of economic growth on the tourism industry, and tourism companies should increase tourism investment during the periods of economic downturn"
2021-0515,0,the breakthroughs in computing over the last decade have opened up a wide range in the analysis of large volumes of data
2021-0515,1,"today, data has become a raw material that is exploited in virtually every business sector to analyze and improve processes and results"
2021-0515,2,one sector where it has a special impact is the financial sector
2021-0515,3,one of the main applications of data analysis in this sector involves applying methodologies that discover patterns and trends in the value of financial products
2021-0515,4,"however, data analysis can also be used to analyze users and not just products"
2021-0515,5,the work presented in this article aims to analyze financial products and users in order to make product recommendations adapted to the objectives of each user at an individual level
2021-0515,6,"to this end, a profile of each user is obtained and an analysis is made of which financial products are capable of satisfying their investment objectives within the set time frame"

2021-0517,2,"while terrorist finance might have once been more at risk of detection in some jurisdictions than others, fintech threatens to bring about a levelling of risk across jurisdictions"
2021-0517,3,"to what extent, though, do we expect decision-makers engaged in transferring funds for terrorism to switch seamlessly in response to changes in risk? because terrorist finance requires choice under risk and uncertainty, it may be characterized by systematic patterns of error deriving from human decision-making processes"
2021-0517,4,"these errors cause delays, or stickiness in adaptation to new conditions and may provide openings for counter-terrorist finance (ctf)"
2021-0094,0,financial technology (fintech) is rapidly transforming the economy as well as the financial landscape in china
2021-0094,1,"this paper attempts to shed light on its contributing factors, current state, economic impacts and potential risks"
2021-0094,2,"we identify three key drivers for chinas fintech development, namely shortage of supply in formal financial market, strong government support for promoting financial inclusion through digital technology, and more tolerant regulatory environment"
2021-0094,3,"the greatest value of the chinese fintech sector is promotion of financial inclusion, enabling a vast number of small- and medium-sized enterprises (smes) and low-income households to access to financial services"
2021-0094,4,"existing studies unveil some strong evidences of fintech development improving efficiency, increasing employment and supporting entrepreneurship"
2021-0094,5,"in the meantime, there are also serious challenges facing this sector, such as regulatory uncertainties, illegal transactions, data abuse, etc"
2021-0094,6,"we conclude the paper by presenting some key takeaways, including several lessons for financial regulation"
2021-0029,0,this paper empirically tests the effect of fintech development on bank risk taking using unbalanced bank-level panel data from china for the period from 2011 to 2018
2021-0029,1,we use the media's attention paid to fintech-related information to gauge fintech development
2021-0029,2,we find robust evidence that the development of fintech exacerbates banks risk taking in general
2021-0029,3,"the heterogeneity analysis further indicates that the asset quality deterioration effect brought about by prosperous fintech is more salient in banks with larger sizes, lower efficiency, more shadow banking business and more interest-based income"
2021-0029,4,"moreover, the nexus between fintech and banks risk taking is a u-shaped trend, with fintech initially intensifying and then weakening banks risk taking"
2021-0029,5,"moreover, the banks responses regarding the u-shaped effect are heterogeneous among different ownership structures"
2021-0029,6,"the responses by state- and jointly owned banks are not notable, while those of city banks, foreign banks and rural banks are more sensitive"
2021-0518,0,consolidation in banking raise concerns about exclusion and predatory practices in small-business lending
2021-0518,1,"fintech lenders, largely unregulated credit providers with lending decisions and loan terms determined primarily by algorithm, have rapidly increased their lending to small businesses"
2021-0518,2,i analyze loan-level data on consumer and small business loans from fintech lenders and a comparison sample of small-business loans from regulated bank lenders
2021-0518,3,fintech small-business loans charge average annual interest rates 3 percentage points higher than consumer loans from the same lender and 4 to 7 percentage points higher than small business loans from regulated banking entities
2021-0518,4,the large interest-rate premium points to the need for regulatory clarity and additional supervision to protect this crucial market segment from predatory non-bank lenders
2021-0056,0,this research analyses high-frequency data of the cryptocurrency market in regards to intraday trading patterns related to algorithmic trading and its impact on the european cryptocurrency market
2021-0056,1,"we study trading quantitatives such as returns, traded volumes, volatility periodicity, and provide summary statistics of return correlations to crix (cryptocurrency index), as well as respective overall high-frequency based market statistics with respect to temporal aspects"
2021-0056,2,"our results provide mandatory insight into a market, where the grand scale employment of automated trading algorithms and the extremely rapid execution of trades might seem to be a standard based on media reports"
2021-0056,3,our findings on intraday momentum of trading patterns lead to a new quantitative view on approaching the predictability of economic value in this new digital market
2021-0016,0,"using the coronavirus covid-19 outbreak as a set-up for a quasi-experiment, this study derives novel insights on the dynamic correlation between bitcoin and us stocks"
2021-0016,1,"given the unprecedented scale of infections and the nature of the virus, the potential impact on the dynamic correlation was unpredictable and therefore uncertain"
2021-0016,2,"using a difference-in-differences setting, the dynamic correlation between bitcoin and stocks is controlled for the dynamic correlation between gold and stocks"
2021-0016,3,this study finds that bitcoin performed poorly in hedging this tail risk
2021-0101,0,global financial standard-setting has been the exclusive domain of advanced economies for decades
2021-0101,1,"following the 200809 crisis, china and other emerging markets and developing economies obtained formal membership in the forums of global financial regulatory governance"
2021-0101,2,"has their incorporation changed global regulatory politics? we analyze the epistemic contestation, bargaining, and persuasion surrounding the latest item on the financial regulatory reform agenda of the g20 and the financial stability board: non-bank credit intermediation"
2021-0101,3,"our study identifies three groups of norm entrepreneurs with different epistemic backgrounds that advance partially overlapping and competing interpretative frames of how to define, understand, and regulate this amorphous financial (non-)sector"
2021-0101,4,"regulators from western advanced economies took the lead in defining non-bank finance as stability-threatening shadow banking, successfully asserting epistemic authority against alternative frames advanced by china and other developing countries that include developmental prerogatives"
2021-0101,5,"confronted with this impasse, chinese authorities have sought to re-frame non-bank finance at the g20 under the label of digital financial inclusion"
2021-0101,6,our findings challenge and refine salient theories of global regulatory politics and underscore the importance of epistemic concerns for debates over the consequences of the entry of new actors from the global south into the core institutions of global financial governance
2021-0003,0,fintech is the digital sector of retail money and finance widely proclaimed to be transforming banking in the global north and banking the unbanked in the global south
2021-0003,1,"this paper develops a perspective for critically understanding fintech as a platform political economy that is marked by three distinctive and related processes: reintermediation, consolidation, and capitalisation"
2021-0003,2,"through experimentation with the platform business model and building on the digital infrastructures and data flows of the broader platform ecosystem, a constellation of organisationsincluding start-ups, early-career firms, bigtech companies and incumbent banksare engaged in processes of platform reintermediation"
2021-0003,3,"changing the bases of competition in retail money and financial markets and encouraging oligopoly and even monopoly, the reintermediation processes of fintech are presently manifest in strong tendencies towards platform consolidation"
2021-0003,4,"the imagined potential of fintech has also triggered intensive processes of capitalisation, with platforms receiving significant prospective investment by venture capital, private equity funds, banks and bigtech firms"
2021-0009,0,this paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent evidence on financial inclusion from all the regions of the world
2021-0009,1,it identifies the emerging themes in the financial inclusion literature as well as some controversy in policy circles regarding financial inclusion
2021-0009,2,"in particular, i draw attention to some issues such as optimal financial inclusion, extreme financial inclusion, how financial inclusion can transmit systemic risks to the formal financial sector, and whether financial inclusion and exclusion are pro-cyclical with changes in the economic cycle"
2021-0009,3,"the key findings in this review indicate that financial inclusion affects, and is influenced by, the level of financial innovation, poverty-levels, the stability of the financial sector, the state of the economy, financial literacy, and regulatory frameworks which differ across countries"
2021-0009,4,"finally, the issues discussed in this paper opens up several avenues for future research"

2020-0045,6,"however, it has been found that perceived technology risks do not significantly affect the intention to use fintech applications"
2020-0045,7,"moreover, the results also indicate that customer trust is significantly mediating the relationship between perceived risks and intention to use fintech applications"
2020-0045,8,"fintech service providers should insure that their products are easy to use, fulfill needs and protect consumers data in order to ensure trust, hence positively influencing consumer adoption"
2020-0105,0,"fintech ecosystems (fe) are characterized by heterogeneous, non-linear, dynamic and complex network of agents that interact with each other to provide a wide array of financial products and services to end customers"
2020-0105,1,"with the rise of myriad complementary technologies, the complexity of fintech ecosystems is increasing exponentially as new players are emerging and new connections are formed"
2020-0105,2,"despite the widespread attention fintech ecosystems have attracted from both academia and practice, rather little is known about how such an ecosystem emerge"
2020-0105,3,"toward addressing this knowledge gap, this research paper draws on complex adaptive systems (cass) theory to examine the emergence of a global self-sustaining ecosystem: the fintech valley in vizag, india"
2020-0105,4,"in doing so, our findings offer insights into the dynamics of fe emergence that is transforming the financial landscape globally, and may be helpful to practitioners who are looking to effect organization-wide cultural change and the 'compliant by design' approach"
2020-0215,0,"the burgeoning financial technology scene in singapore has seen the emergence of robo-advisors, which aim to disrupt traditional financial advisories by using algorithms to automate client advising and investment recommendations"
2020-0215,1,"using an ecologies concept to explore how lay investors are articulated into global financial networks through robo advisors, this paper contributes to studies on the financialization of everyday life"
2020-0215,2,"it argues that investors are rendered passive by the disciplinary tools of algorithms, contemporary finance theories and elements of robo-advisor platforms that feed into these sociotechnological assemblages"
2020-0215,3,the state's role in embedding citizen investors in these human-machine relationships is considered
2020-0215,4,"the fragmented landscape of free, nonprofessional online financial advice and the opaque qualities of investing algorithms make investor subject formation incomplete and uncertain, especially when markets are highly volatile"
2020-0215,5,this paper explores how both financial inclusion and exclusion operate simultaneously in robo-advisors and argues that robo-advisors may weaken efforts to promote financial literacy and education
2020-0029,0,blockchain is one the most remarkable technological innovations of the 21st century
2020-0029,1,the most notable application of blockchain is in the development and operation of cryptocurrencies (e.g
2020-0029,2,"bitcoin, ethereum, among others)"
2020-0029,3,"besides the financial services industry, blockchain is also considered in other sectors such as international trade, taxation, supply chain management, business operations and governance"
2020-0029,4,"however, blockchain has not been examined comprehensively in all areas of relevant literature"
2020-0029,5,this article conducts a survey of the literature to gain an understanding of the opportunities and issues presented by blockchain in various business functions
2020-0029,6,the article begins by providing a discussion regarding how the blockchain technology operates
2020-0029,7,"the paper takes a broad focus in its analysis of the prospects of blockchain for various business functions, including banking and the capital markets, corporate governance, international trade, and taxation"
2020-0029,8,"the paper demonstrates how organisations and regulators can leverage blockchain to upscale business operations, enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs"
2020-0029,9,the key drawbacks of blockchain that stakeholders need to bear in mind before adopting the technology are also highlighted
2020-0029,10,the article also reflects on how organisations can tap into blockchain to reap the full potential of the fourth industrial revolution
2020-0092,0,whether fintech causes the fragility of financial institutions is a controversial issue
2020-0092,1,"using a panel sample of listed banks from 84 countries, we exploit the introduction of fintech regulatory sandboxes as an exogenous shock and examine the heterogeneous effect of fintech on the fragility of financial institutions"
2020-0092,2,"we find that (i) a shock to fintech innovations has no net effect on the fragility of financial institutions when we ignore market characteristics, (ii) promoting fintech decreases (increases) the fragility of financial institutions in emerging (developed) financial markets, and (iii) fintech affects the fragility of financial institutions through the channel of profitability"
2020-0214,0,"in the field of finance, the application of deep learning methods to asset returns can yield more intuitive results than those derived using standard methods"
2020-0214,1,"we use the daily returns from the shanghai stock exchange (sse) 50 and china security index (csi) 300 index in the chinese stock market to compare both standard linear methods (ordinary least squares, stepwise regression, principal components regression (pcr), elastic net (enet)) and deep learning neural network (nn) methods with one, two, and three hidden layers (nn1, nn2, and nn3, respectively) from january 2012 to december 2017"
2020-0214,2,"we show that for both sse 50 and csi 300 indices, not all nn models outperform linear models in terms of out-out-of-sample roos2 values in the 2017 test dataset"
2020-0214,3,"however, the nn models with one and three hidden layers do not outperform the classical pcr model in terms of out-of-sample ros2 values for the sse 50 index, whereas all the deep learning methods outperform the traditional models for the csi 300 index"
2020-0214,4,the nn model with two hidden layers performs the best in terms of the out-out-of-sample r2 values for the csi 300 index
2020-0214,5,"in the out-out-of-sample dataset, nn3 performs poorly for both sse 50 and csi 300 indices, while the deepest nns are not the best performing"
2020-0009,0,fintech innovations are enabling access to financial services through mobile devices for many unbanked in the world
2020-0009,1,"though fintech innovations are touted as game changers in deepening financial inclusion, their wide acceptance and use still remain limited"
2020-0009,2,"in the extant literature, technological and behavioural antecedents that influence users behaviour toward financial technologies are not fully understood"
2020-0009,3,this study argues that understanding antecedents to the actual use of fintech innovations will lead to deepening financial inclusion
2020-0009,4,"using mobile moneya type of fintech innovation, this study adopts the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (utaut2) and the prospect theory"
2020-0009,5,"drawing on survey data collected from 294 respondents, this study applies the partial least square structural equation modelling technique"
2020-0009,6,the findings show that performance and effort expectancy have significant relationship with the intention to use mobile money services
2020-0009,7,"however, contrary to well-established positions, price value, hedonic motivation, social influence and perceived risk do not influence intention and use of mobile money services"
2020-0009,8,the study makes significant theoretical contributions and offers practical and policy implications for deepening financial inclusion
2020-0046,0,"deep learning has been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, and audio-visual recognition"
2020-0046,1,the overwhelming success of deep learning as a data processing technique has sparked the interest of the research community
2020-0046,2,"given the proliferation of fintech in recent years, the use of deep learning in finance and banking services has become prevalent"
2020-0046,3,"however, a detailed survey of the applications of deep learning in finance and banking is lacking in the existing literature"
2020-0046,4,"this study surveys and analyzes the literature on the application of deep learning models in the key finance and banking domains to provide a systematic evaluation of the model preprocessing, input data, and model evaluation"
2020-0046,5,"finally, we discuss three aspects that could affect the outcomes of financial deep learning models"
2020-0046,6,this study provides academics and practitioners with insight and direction on the state-of-the-art of the application of deep learning models in finance and banking
2020-0309,0,this paper aims to adopt the principles of sustainable risk management for both providers and users who demand to use financial technology (fintech) with high security
2020-0309,1,risk management is consider both compliance and sustainability
2020-0309,2,"moreover, fintech is considered for financial industry and related with e-transaction or e-payment industries as well"
2020-0309,3,there are certain standards (iso31000:2018 and iso27005:2018) and fundamentally applied in information technology
2020-0309,4,"however, it renders insufficient for the newer technologies"
2020-0309,5,in order to determine and assess the potential risks associated with fintech
2020-0309,6,our finding are business and technology risks which are related to fintech
2020-0309,7,these two clusters are validated by qualitative and quantitative method
2020-0309,8,this study combines a known set of fintech risks with data obtained through the consensus process
2020-0309,9,i-cvis and k-mean clustering algorithm are the tools for data analysis on this paper
2020-0309,10,it has been found that the technologies themselves are at risks of 0.3 and the business risks are at 0.7
2020-0309,11,the study indicate that traditional technology risks have relevant
2020-0309,12,the difference in the levels of risks depends on the details of each fintech type and the parts of the business which technologies are associated with
2020-0309,13,"in addition, the new sets of risks based on the current situations can also be eliminated the risks to create sustainable business"
2020-0177,0,"over the past decade, technological innovations have changed the dynamics of the financial system"
2020-0177,1,"as a result, firms have used cellular phones, the internet, and digital currencies to facilitate exchanges and operate their businesses"
2020-0177,2,this course of action affects the transmission mechanism of monetary policy
2020-0177,3,the goal of the present study is to examine the role that fintech plays in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy
2020-0177,4,"first, we analyse the income velocity and the money multiplier during pre-fintech and post-fintech periods"
2020-0177,5,the results confirm that there is no change in income velocity and the money multiplier during these periods
2020-0177,6,"second, we develop the money demand function to examine the effect of monetary policy and demonstrate that low monetary policy rates lead to an increase in money demand"
2020-0177,7,"when we introduce fintech components to examine their impact on money demand, we find that mobile and internet technologies and all digital currencies considered in this study are robust predictors of money demand"
2020-0177,8,"third, we analyse the product market equation and report that after the initiation of fintech, monetary policy has a significant effect"
2020-0177,9,"to examine the cost function, we incorporate fintech components and identify that cellular phones, internet technology, litecoin, and ethereum are the determinants of the output gap"
2020-0177,10,"finally, we examine the drivers of fintech and determine that the real interest rate, gdp, inflation, the financial development index, and stock market indices are significant determinants of fintech"
2020-0114,0,"this paper represents an early attempt to investigate the growth and distributional effects of fintech development, using household survey data from china"
2020-0114,1,"china's rapid expansion of fintech in the past decade has significantly improved the accessibility and affordability of financial services, particularly for formerly financially excluded population groups"
2020-0114,2,"linking the index of digital financial inclusion with china family panel studies (cfps) data, we find that fintech development is positively correlated with household income, and the positive effect is larger for rural households than the urban counterpart, suggesting that fintech development has helped narrow the urban-rural income gap"
2020-0114,3,"moreover, the poor gain more than the rich from fintech development in rural china, indicating its benign distributive impacts within rural china"
2020-0213,0,"retail has undergone disruption every 10 years on average owing to economics, format innovation, and, most recently, technology transformation.we envision this landscape will go far beyond the shift towards e-commerce.this paper reviews technology of the future that will affect the industry, with predictions of how consumers will be likely to adapt"
2020-0213,1,"it is informed by extensive fieldwork throughout the world1, 2 and the authors combined experience in retail and technology"
2020-0213,2,"beyond commerce, we see all industries facing a future of transformation"
2020-0213,3,"but retailers have historically coped with disruption, and we believe the dramatic pace of changes and opportunity facing them can be a playbook for executives in all businesses"
2020-0213,4,"retailers have to operate 24/7, 365 days a year  at full speed and with narrow margins"
2020-0213,5,"an immense challenge is making step changes while not simply discarding existing mission-critical infrastructure.the retail industry will enter this unknown future with existing systems that must become far more effective with incremental technology, digitally enhanced employees and pervasive data management across the whole organisation"
2020-0213,6,"in other words, they must operate with the capabilities they have for today while transforming for tomorrow.this becomes more complex as smart homes, smart stores and connected cities advance"
2020-0310,0,"this paper provides insight into the current small and medium enterprise (sme) and banking landscapes, exploring the challenges both face, and the strained relationship between the two, before advising on methods through which this relationship could be improved"
2020-0310,1,"the paper goes on to explore how fintech firms could play an instrumental role in the evolving rela-tionships between banks and smes, and then outlines four routes that banks could explore to take advantage of this highly lucrative market sector: invest in their own fintech"
2020-0310,2,develop their own technology
2020-0310,3,partner with fintechs
2020-0310,4,or build an open banking ecosystem
2020-0310,5,the paper concludes that banks tend to take a pragmatic approach to problem-solving so are likely to use a combina-tion of the proposed solutions and enlist the help of multiple providers
2020-0310,6,"in this way, banks will be able to capitalise on the opportunities associated with smes and keep up with the rapid pace of change within both the banking industry and society as a whole"
2020-0222,0,the collapse of the global financial industry in 2008 and the subsequent decay of most western economies into a period of prolonged economic stagnation have represented a springboard for the progressive growth of alternative channels of financial intermediation
2020-0222,1,"the reluctance and inability of mainstream banks in the post-crisis years to provide credit facilities to the real economy, most critically to start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises, propelled the latest wave of financial innovation, this time under the guise of fintech"
2020-0222,2,"much has been written on the rise of fintech in recent years, but there is still insufficient clarity about the benefits that this phenomenon is bringing to the real economy and the potential risks that can arise from its growth"
2020-0222,3,this paper maps the development of fintech lending platforms in the uk and reconceptualises the rationale for their growth
2020-0222,4,"in doing that, this study focuses on the structure and operation of the main uk platforms, recognising that while some are effectively banks that adopt a technology-based business model, many platforms operate under the p2p business model"
2020-0222,5,the question then is to assess the policy and regulatory approach that is relevant to uk p2p platforms
2020-0222,6,"interestingly, the emergence of p2p securitisation raises a number of regulatory and policy questions, because longer intermediation chains typical of securitisation may well defy the social and economic purposes under which the idea of p2p developed"
2020-0222,7,"furthermore, questions of systemic risk inevitably resurface in these types of transactions"
2020-0222,8,"ensuing problems related to the best way to regulate these new channels of financial intermediation lead to critically evaluate the initiatives launched by the uk fca, initially under the innovation hub, and more recently under the consultation for a new regulatory framework"
2020-0311,0,the financial industry is one of the earliest and most comprehensive industries that integrate with artificial intelligence
2020-0311,1,"the application of a series of artificial intelligence technologies such as data mining, accurate profiling, machine learning, neural networks, will provide financial products, service channels, service methods, risk management, credit financing and investment decision-making have brought about a new round of changes"
2020-0311,2,"firstly, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has a profound impact on the high-end finance of the deep service value chain"
2020-0311,3,"secondly, the integrated development of artificial intelligence and finance is irreversible, risks and opportunities coexist, and the financial industry must accelerate the pace of adjustment and development"
2020-0311,4,"finally, the financial supervision department further clarifies the supervision responsibility, applies artificial intelligence technology to supervision methods and means, and improves the degree of supervision automation and intelligence"
2020-0312,0,this paper discusses the potential transformation of fintech and finserv sectors in light of the increased use and deployment of artificial intelligence (ai)/machine learning (ml) applications
2020-0312,1,"by drawing on quick scan of available literature, the paper provides an overview of aspects of fintech and finserv sectors which are likely to change and the aspects of these sectors which are likely to remain unchanged"

2020-0313,0,"nowadays, the existence of a fintech entity is a necessity"
2020-0313,1,the choice is disruption or collaboration
2020-0313,2,this study investigates the antecedents of fintech collaboration based on leadership styles and its consequence on competitive advantage
2020-0313,3,the study is a quantitative causality approach using a questionnaire to collect the data and use structural equation modelling to analyse it
2020-0313,4,"there are 166 respondents, as samples, from 479 supervisors to directors of automotive, electronics, and food and beverage of medium and large companies"
2020-0313,5,results show that leadership styles have a positive effect on competitive advantage and fintech collaboration
2020-0313,6,this study's original value is that fintech collaboration is a necessity for managerial decisions as a mediator for competitive advantage based on leadership styles
2020-0313,7,"it concludes that the primary antecedent choice in encouraging fintech collaboration is transactional leadership, and collaboration with the fintech entity to create a competitive advantage is necessary"
2020-0313,8,"meanwhile, for further research, it is assumed that suitable leadership to encourage competitive advantage through fintech is transformational leadership, and collaborate with the fintech entity is a must"
2020-0314,0,beyond fintech: technology applications for the islamic economy is a follow-up to the first-ever islamic fintech book by the author (published in 2018) that provided linkages between islamic finance and disruptive technologies like the blockchain
2020-0314,1,"in the wake of fintech as a new trend in financial markets, the ground-breaking book stressed the relevance of islamic finance and its implications, when enabled by fintech, towards the development of the islamic digital economy"
2020-0314,2,"while the earlier work discussed the crucial innovation, structural, and institutional development for financial technologies in islamic finance, this new research explores the multiple applications possible in the various sectors of the economy, within and beyond finance, that can be significantly transformed"
2020-0314,3,"these revolutionary applications involve the integration of ai, blockchain, data analytics, and internet-of-things (iot) devices for a holistic solution to tackle the bottlenecks and other issues in existing processes of traditional systems"
2020-0314,4,"the principles of accountability, duty, justice, and transparency are the foundation of shaping the framework in achieving good governance in all institutions  public or private, islamic or otherwise"
2020-0314,5,"technologies like ai, blockchain, and iot devices can operationalize the transparency and accountability that is required to eradicate poverty, distribute wealth, enhance micro-, small- and large-scale initiatives for social and economic development, and thus share prosperity for a moral system that enables a more secure and sustainable economy"
2020-0315,0,"the focal point of this paper lies in whether financial technology (fintech) will change the financial system in a manner that will behoove the banking system, in terms of stability and profitability"
2020-0315,1,"with this rationale, we attempt to comprehend fintech drivers and its potential effects focusing on the european banking system"
2020-0315,2,"we test our hypotheses employing a panel gls analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data, spanning the period 2015-2018 and pertaining to a sample of 1,250 banks located within the european union (eu), examining a total of 5,000 useful observations"
2020-0315,3,"the results of our study highlight financial innovation's impact on leverage, bank organization and earning margins"
2020-0315,4,we provide a series of practical recommendations for regulators and european commercial banks with the aim to strengthen their position in financial innovation and monitor the associated risks
2020-0315,5,"this study aims to bridge a gap in existing literature regarding the multiple facets of impact that technological innovations generate on the banking sector, with specific reference to the european banking system"
2020-0175,0,"the extent of financial exclusion in africa drives the adoption of fintech across the continent, but the disruption it can cause hinders progress"
2020-0175,1,this study therefore assesses both the probability and actual rates of fintech adoption in 32 african economies between 2002 and 2018
2020-0175,2,"based on the information spill-over and rank theories, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the average probability of fintech adoption for all, emerging and frontier african economies to be 50.9%, 83.1%, and 23.1%, respectively, whereas the actual rates are 27%, 40%, and 29%, respectively"
2020-0175,3,"the fragile economies, however, had no reasonable probability or actual rates of fintech adoption"
2020-0175,4,"further, odds ratios of 1 or more- suggest a one-unit change in the predicators will exert no impact on these rates"
2020-0175,5,"thus, it is concluded that emerging economies and mobile phone banking drive fintech adoption in africa, and is largely dependent mainly on structural changes rather than economic and financial factors"
2020-0175,6,"the current study consequently recommends improved literacy, ict training, and structural changes to promote fintech across the continent"
2020-0316,0,"in the framework of this research, authors aim to reveal the main determinants of fintech performance"
2020-0316,1,"building on the resource-based view of entrepreneurship, we reveal the determinants of performance of fintech, high-tech companies in the financial area"
2020-0316,2,cross-sectional regression models are used on a dataset of 100 fintechs in russia
2020-0316,3,the performance of fintechs is measured by year-on-year growth in revenues and assets during 2016-2018 and return on assets
2020-0316,4,"the results show that fintechs, having status skolkovo members, perform better than other fintechs"
2020-0316,5,the results are valid for roa and growth in revenues
2020-0316,6,"moreover, the growth of assets is lower for fintechs, founded in moscow"
2020-0316,7,"fintechs, financed by own resources, perform better than other fintechs"
2020-0316,8,it can be explained by the peculiarities of the financing market in russia
2020-0316,9,also timely and prompt repayment of debts has a positive effect on fintechs performance
2020-0316,10,"fintechs, having current liquidity ratio lower, perform better than other fintechs"
2020-0316,11,"the results of research expand the resource-based view of entrepreneurship by revealing difficult-to-imitate resources, which create a competitive advantage for fintechs"
2020-0317,0,the modern trend of the economy is the rapid evolution of the traditional business of financial companies in terms of expanding the list of services provided and changing the algorithm for communicating with customers with the introduction of modern technologies into the production process
2020-0317,1,the purpose of the work is to determine the need to transform the traditional business of financial companies into fintech in order to maintain the competitiveness of companies in the market
2020-0317,2,a brief overview of theoretical and empirical studies of the implementation of modern information and other technologies in the financial (primarily banking and insurance) sphere is presented
2020-0317,3,the international experience of the development of fintech companies with the volume of investments in financial technologies on a global scale is considered
2020-0317,4,the financial technologies that have received the greatest development in russia at the present stage of expansion of the activities of fintech companies are presented
2020-0317,5,the tendencies contributing to the rapid introduction of financial technologies in the public life of the country's citizens are highlighted
2020-0317,6,"the obvious advantages of fintech companies over traditional financial companies are noted, which is reflected in the differences in the development of these firms in the last decade"
2020-0317,7,"the result of the study was the identification of areas of financial business in which fintech is able to oust traditional financial companies from the market, which are unable to develop within the framework of the trend for the introduction of financial technologies"
2020-0317,8,"the study convincingly showed that the financial sector of the economy is rapidly changing, transforming into financial and technological companies that are more competitive through the introduction of modern technologies and focus on a wide range of consumers of services"
2020-0318,0,the article analyzes the popular hypothesis that banks as independent financial institutions will cease to exist and their business will be taken over by fintech companies
2020-0318,1,"although many experts believe that in the confrontation between banks and fintech companies, banks are surrendering their competitive positions in the financial market to fintech companies, the article provides facts proving the opposite"
2020-0318,2,the purpose of the study is to assess the competitive position of banks in comparison with fintech companies
2020-0318,3,"the study used a systematic approach, comparative analysis, expert estimates, logical analysis"
2020-0318,4,the article recognizes the fact that there are new competitors in the financial market
2020-0318,5,"however, fintech companies are ahead of banks exclusively in technology, expanding the delivery channels of banking products to customers"
2020-0318,6,the product line of banks is much larger than that of fintech companies
2020-0318,7,"banks, with the skills and experience of a highly professional banking business, have begun digital transformation"
2020-0318,8,today banks are transferring their business to new modern technologies
2020-0318,9,banking leaders are becoming leaders among all financial market players
2020-0318,10,"this is especially noticeable in russia, where the largest bank, the savings bank of russia, has officially announced a change in its business model"
2020-0318,11,"the sber ecosystem, he created, marked the beginning of the transition to the next stage in the development of the fintech area"
2020-0318,12,"summarizing the results of the study, the authors of this article proved that universal banks remain the leaders in the russian financial market both in terms of product line and digital technologies, russian banks began to develop the non-banking services sector and create integrated ecosystems"
2020-0318,13,"also, the authors substantiated the onset of the era of fintech 4.0, identifying signs that allow making this conclusion"
2020-0319,0,"initial coin offerings (icos) are a new fundraising method for businesses, companies or entrepreneurs through a smart contract"
2020-0319,1,"the ico fundraising model was one of the most popular fintechs from 2016 to 2018, as the most supportive tool for startups in countries with limitations on initial public offerings (ipos)"
2020-0319,2,"among icos ended in 2018, the leading sectors of funds raised included cryptocurrencies, business platforms, and business service projects"

2020-0320,0,the informal economy became the new frontier for technology firms
2020-0320,1,"the monetization of the activities in the informal economy has resulted in the formation of global enterprises such as uber, careem, bolt, and gojek"
2020-0320,2,"this paper discusses the social outcomes of data-driven platform technology in the informal economy through a case study that describes the activities of gojek, an indonesian online motor taxi platform"
2020-0320,3,"the unique role online service platforms play in marginalized communities, the speed at which platforms have expanded globally, and the influence on the debate around labor laws make it well worth the time to assess how this specific technology corresponds with human development"
2020-0320,4,"in particular, the impact platforms have on the level of social inclusion"
2020-0320,5,the transformations platforms have made show the desire to solve broken systems in society through technology
2020-0320,6,"this also explains how gojek transformed from an online gig work mediator to a digital banking system, assisting financial inclusion efforts for unbanked people"
2020-0320,7,"this paper concludes that social inclusion can indeed only be achieved when the split in society is addressed between the informal and the formal economy-for example, facilitating corporations to create financial access for people at the periphery without acknowledging legislation that got them there in the first-place anchors the inequality even further"
2020-0321,0,the advancements within the field of computer science in the last years has been enormous
2020-0321,1,"ai cloud services, crypto currencies, 5g, autonomous vehicles, smart homes, quantum computing, affective computing"
2020-0321,2,the traditional organizational model for preparing computer science educators should be also following this fast pace and study programs should be aligned with recent developments and the latest trends in industry
2020-0321,3,"the aim of this article is to present to future educational designers examples of one new program in the domain of fintech, and how 3 technical universities in europe prepared their fintech masters degrees"
2020-0321,4,we give further suggestions and guidelines for universities how to develop such programs
2020-0322,0,financial technologies (fintech) are gaining popularity amongst organizations due to its ability in improving their competitiveness
2020-0322,1,"as a result, organizations are seeking ways in the development of fintech projects"
2020-0322,2,"the performance evaluation of the most suitable fintech project, however, is complex and challenging due to the involvement of multiple decision makers, the multi-dimensional nature of the evaluation process and the presence of vagueness and imprecision inherent in the human decision making process"
2020-0322,3,"to deal with this problem, this paper presents a multicriteria group decision making approach for evaluating the performance of fintech projects"
2020-0322,4,intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are used for effectively modelling the vagueness and imprecision of the decision making process
2020-0322,5,a multicriteria group decision making approach is developed for calculating an overall performance index for every fintech project alternative across all criteria
2020-0322,6,a fintech project performance evaluation problem is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
2020-0323,0,"the objective of this study is to examine the perceived benefits of the application of fintech, machine learning and artificial intelligence (ai) or (fmai) in programmed decision making for the consumers, producers or employers"
2020-0323,1,"the study is based on a theoretical model, developed step by step to explain consumers' satisfaction and employers' benefits when the company or the employer introduces fintech, machine learning and ai for implementing the policies in programmed decisions"
2020-0323,2,"the results and findings show that the application of fintech, machine learning and ai will maximize the consumers' satisfaction and employers' benefits"
2020-0323,3,"the application of fmai saves time for the consumers, minimizes the number of trips to the offices, and reduces the confrontations with the unpleasant customer service representatives"
2020-0323,4,"fmai are user friendly, and it has the potential to increase consumers' satisfaction as well as employers' benefits by nicely settling the issues with the consumers and other stakeholders"
2020-0323,5,the consumers remain the focal point and will make sure that consumers will not desert the company
2020-0323,6,this is perhaps one of the latest studies which blends fmai with programmed decision-making process and shows perceived benefits for both consumers and producers and thus society's total wellbeing will be the maximum
2020-0125,0,the novel corona virus (covid-19) is a phenomenon with the aftereffects of this pandemic can be felt in the next few years to come
2020-0125,1,"economic consequences of the pandemic are huge on the islamic finance industry, it is also evident from the slow growth forecast by the various agencies for the industry"
2020-0125,2,"in this paper, we consider this pandemic as an opportunity for the islamic finance industry to grow and prove its worth again after the global financial crisis of 2008 and emerge as a major contender to the conventional financial system"
2020-0125,3,"we develop a model which reveals that covid-19 is an opportunity with more integrated and transformative growth with high level of standardization, with key focus of the industry on the social cause and tactical adoption of financial technology"
2020-0125,4,the paper has an implication to the islamic finance and banking industry as it provides a framework for the future researchers and practitioners to understand and adopt islamic finance in the post covid-19 era
2020-0324,0,the current study aims to examine the factors affecting the acceptance of the digital wallets in kingdom of bahrain
2020-0324,1,a multi-item scale is designed to measure the different risk and benefit factors
2020-0324,2,a sample data of 392 digital wallets users were obtained from bahrain through online survey to empirically validate the constructs using confirmatory factor analysis (cfa)
2020-0324,3,the structural equation model (sem) is used to assess the structural model and test the relevant hypotheses to examine the continuous intention to use digital wallets in bahrain
2020-0173,0,credit scoring systems are critical fintech applications that concern the analysis of the creditworthiness of a person or organization
2020-0173,1,"while decisions were previously based on human expertise, they are now increasingly relying on data analysis and machine learning"
2020-0173,2,"in this paper, we assess the ability of state-of-the-art adversarial machine learning to craft attacks on a real-world credit scoring system"
2020-0173,3,"interestingly, we find that, while these techniques can generate large numbers of adversarial data, these are practically useless as they all violate domain-specific constraints"
2020-0173,4,"in other words, the generated examples are all false positives as they cannot occur in practice"
2020-0173,5,"to circumvent this limitation, we propose coeva2, a search-based method that generates valid adversarial examples (satisfying the domain constraints)"
2020-0173,6,"coeva2 utilizes multi-objective search in order to simultaneously handle constraints, perform the attack and maximize the overdraft amount requested"
2020-0173,7,we evaluate coeva2 on a major bank's real-world system by checking its ability to craft valid attacks
2020-0173,8,"coeva2 generates thousands of valid adversarial examples, revealing a high risk for the banking system"
2020-0173,9,"fortunately, by improving the system through adversarial training (based on the produced examples), we increase its robustness and make our attack fail"
2020-0325,0,blockchain is a technology for decentralized transactions that has been widely used with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin
2020-0325,1,"many studies have been conducted in the last decades, approaching cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology, more strongly in the context of financial transactions"
2020-0325,2,"however, little has been done to provide a panoramic view of the current literature"
2020-0325,3,"as a consequence, a careful understanding of the state-of-the-art papers remains limited and inconclusive"
2020-0325,4,"this study, therefore, aims to classify and provide a thematic analysis of studies on the use of blockchain in the context of financial area, thus allowing to create a clear systematic map of the current literature, and identify challenges and research opportunities"
2020-0325,5,to achieve these objectives a systematic mapping study (sms) approach was performed to answer 6 research questions
2020-0325,6,"in total, 1884 studies were reviewed from 6 data sources, being 23 studies selected after a careful filtering process"
2020-0325,7,the main findings were: (1) over 65% of the selected studies concentrated on adopting two blockchain platforms named hyperledger fabric and ethereum
2020-0325,8,(2) over 60% used blockchain technology to increase security
2020-0325,9,(3) most studies did not reveal the consensus algorithm used
2020-0325,10,(4) fintech (or bank) and loan were the most explored application areas
2020-0325,11,(5) over 60% focused on producing prototype rather than frameworks
2020-0325,12,and (6) most studies were published in conferences
2020-0325,13,"this study can benefit research community by generating a map of the literature, serving as a starting point for future researches"
2020-0325,14,"moreover, this study reports some challenges worth investigating"
2020-0326,0,the 2008 financial crisis gave birth to fintech and blockchain
2020-0326,1,"while blockchain applications are still at their infancy, fintech has fundamentally changed the landscape of the financial industry"
2020-0326,2,"in the data economy era, the big techs are threatening financial industry since they own users' behavior data"
2020-0326,3,"in this paper, alternative models focusing on the decentralization and value sharing nature of the open ecosystem were studied and put into practical applications"
2020-0326,4,"the effectiveness of the models to attract stakeholders to pool their resources and contribute data, analytics and services for value co-creation and sharing is still being tested"
2020-0326,5,the preliminary results show promises
2020-0221,0,"as an increasing number of investors post their opinions or show their decisions on public platforms, a critical challenge is to make trading decisions by considering opinions from online investors"
2020-0221,1,"in this paper, by taking the real-world data from stocktwits as an example, we develop followakoinvestor, a systematic two-step framework to utilize sentiments from various kinds of investors to forecast stocks"
2020-0221,2,"first, followakoinvestor divides investors into various groups according to their expertise levels and extract sentiments from different investor groups as features"
2020-0221,3,"then, it uses machine learning techniques to make trading decisions by learning a prediction function to appropriately combine sentiments from different kinds of investors"
2020-0221,4,the intuition of followakoinvestor is that sentiments extracted from all kinds of investors (including experts and non-experts) can help us invest in stocks
2020-0221,5,extensive data analysis and experiments show that followakoinvestor generates high-yield portfolios

2020-0062,0,"a growing number of american workers are now freelancers and thus, responsible for their own retirement savings, yet they face psychological hurdles that hamper them from saving enough money for the long term"
2020-0062,1,"although prior theory-derived interventions have been successful in addressing some of these obstacles, encouraging participation in saving programs is a challenging endeavor for policy makers and consumers alike"
2020-0062,2,"in a field setting, we test whether framing savings in more or less granular formats (for ex-ample, saving daily versus monthly) can encourage continued saving behavior through increasing the take up of a recurring deposit program"
2020-0062,3,"among thousands of new users of a financial technology app, we find that framing deposits in daily amounts as opposed to monthly amounts quadruples the number of consumers who enroll"
2020-0062,4,"furthermore, framing deposits in more granular terms reduced the participation gap between lower-and higher-income consumers: three times as many consumers in the highest rather than lowest income bracket participated in the program when it was framed as a $150 monthly deposit, but this difference in participation was eliminated when deposits were framed as $5 per day"
2020-0142,0,this paper explores the most recent fintech (financial technology) phenomenon from an ecosystem perspective
2020-0142,1,"differentiated from the earlier fintech evolution led by traditional financial institutions, cross-sector fintech that operates at the intersection of financial services and information technology disrupts existing business models of banks while creating novel ecosystem dynamics"
2020-0142,2,this study explores the fintech ecosystem composition to understand better business model innovation based on underlying ecosystem dynamics while focusing on the specific role of cross-sector actors
2020-0142,3,these actors have escaped scrutiny despite being mature and experienced and having strong resource bases
2020-0142,4,"adopting a comparative case study method by considering the china-based alibaba group and tencent, the studys findings indicate that novel business model developments based on strong technological expertise and scale-based resources by cross-sector fintech render a functional perspective on fast-developing fintech industry less practical"
2020-0142,5,"apart from cross-sector fintech, investors constitute a new dimension in the conceptualization of the fintech ecosystem"
2020-0142,6,"overall, the interconnectedness of the cross-sector fintech beyond the fintech sectors drives the fuzzy boundaries between ecosystems, established business models, terminology definitions, ecosystem actors roles and relationships, which appear to become more heterogeneous and changeable over time"
2020-0142,7,the study contributes to the scant literature on fintech ecosystems and their sustainable development
2020-0223,0,cybertech has drawn academic attention in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (gfc) as banks were forced to embrace cybertech more aggressively to cope with market competition after the crisis
2020-0223,1,"banks can improve their operational efficiency and quality of service by relying on cybertech, but they become more vulnerable to cybersecurity"
2020-0223,2,"thus, increasing investment in cybertech becomes a strategic necessity for banks to combat cybersecurity hazards"
2020-0223,3,the study investigates how disruptive digital transformation affects bank stability
2020-0223,4,"in particular, it examines whether the law of diminishing marginal returns from overspending on cybertech affects bank stability"
2020-0223,5,"based on a global sample from 43 countries, we find that an increase in cybertech spending above the threshold level adversely affects the stability of banks"
2020-0223,6,the main reason behind the adverse effect of cybertech spending on the stability of banks is that banks take more than the proportional risk for every dollar they spend on disruptive cybertech after they cross a threshold level of spending
2020-0223,7,"while results persist across sub-samples, our results indicate two important channels of technological regimes  a diminishing returns regime and an increasing returns regime"
2020-0223,8,"the diminishing returns regime improves bank stability through more aggressive spending on technology, and the increasing returns regime makes banks more unstable due to excess spending on disruptive cybertech"
2020-0223,9,the study has implications for cybersecurity and sustainable cybertech spending for banks
2020-0236,0,"costello, down, and mehta (2020) trace their slider intervention to deviations from the credit line amount recommended by a credit scoring model"
2020-0236,1,"the deviations are followed by larger delinquency declines and bigger sales orders, and costello et al"
2020-0236,2,interpret these results using discretion-based theories
2020-0236,3,"however, incremental deviations are concentrated on newer clients rather than those the lender has accumulated soft information about"
2020-0236,4,deviations also appear larger for public than private borrowers
2020-0236,5,"my discussion evaluates whether these results align with discretion-based theories, and explores alternative interpretations based on salience and unique aspects of the trade credit setting"
2020-0236,6,"differences in interpretation aside, the evidence is informative about technological advances in commercial lending"
2020-0236,7,i conclude with an overview of several recent advances and discuss the implications for lending research
2020-0143,0,"we assess the role of human discretion in lending outcomes using a randomized, controlled experiment"
2020-0143,1,"the lenders in our sample utilize a third party, machine-generated credit model as an input in their decision"
2020-0143,2,we design a new feature for the credit-scoring platform  the slider feature  which invites lenders to incorporate additional discretion in their decision by adjusting the machine-based recommendation
2020-0143,3,"we compare the loan outcomes for treatment lenders that randomly get the slider, relative to a control group"
2020-0143,4,"the treatment group's adjustments are predictive of forward looking portfolio characteristics  they show larger declines in future portfolio-level credit risk and larger increases in future sales orders, relative to the control group"
2020-0143,5,the effects of our intervention are more pronounced when borrowers do not have social media accounts and in competitive markets
2020-0143,6,"our study provides insights about the role of human decisions, given the rapid evolution of machine-based lending models"
2020-0095,0,"like incubators, regulatory sandboxes constitute a prominent mechanism to enable entrepreneurial activities that guide financial technology (fintech) firms through regulatory frameworks in the financial industry"
2020-0095,1,"because they are new, there is a lack of research on regulatory sandboxes"
2020-0095,2,most studies have investigated legal aspects while overlooking the management perspective
2020-0095,3,"to address this gap, this paper builds on incubation research studies to explore how social interactions within regulatory sandboxes influence the practices of regulators and regulatees, using social capital theory"
2020-0095,4,"an exploratory-abductive approach is adopted, using data collected from 16 semi-structured interviews"
2020-0095,5,"the findings indicate that regulator-regulatee social interactions increase the legitimacy, risk management capabilities, and knowledge of regulatory frameworks among regulatees and, as to regulators, increase their understanding of regulatory constraints and potential risks in enabling technologies, better inform them of regulatees support needs, and offer them early access to regulatory innovations"
2020-0095,6,the findings also reveal that the practices of regulators and regulatees may be negatively affected due to lowered trust and discrepancies in expectations and underlying goals
2020-0095,7,this research contributes to the incubation literature by focusing on the micro and meso levels of knowledge exchange and the entrepreneurial finance literature by promoting the role of incubation models

2020-0118,0,"initial coin offerings (icos) are unregulated offerings of digital tokens on the internet, built on the blockchain technology, as to provide a means to collect finance for a project, disintermediating any external platform, payment agent or professional investor"
2020-0118,1,"ico proponents are usually teams made up by entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians and managers, eventually assisted by an advisory committee"
2020-0118,2,"in this work, we analyse the determinants of the characteristics of the advisory board and using different centrality and connectedness measures from social network analysis we analyse the relationship with the ico fundraising success"
2020-0118,3,we find that larger and more experienced teams are more likely to appoint a committee of advisors and its presence is significantly correlated with the ico success
2020-0118,4,different facets of the ico centrality in the advisors network are associated to different effects
2020-0118,5,"we find a u-shaped relationship between the number of advisors connections, their capability to act as bridges in the network and the ico success"
2020-0118,6,"we also find that, in order to raise larger amount of money, it is important to hire advisors which are linked to well-connected advisors in other icos and are more closely linked to all other nodes in the network"
2020-0070,0,"in the introduction to the first-ever special issue on the spatial dimensions of fintech, we show that despite a fintech fever in business and media, research on fintech is still niche, particularly in social sciences"
2020-0070,1,"we describe fintech as a research area full of controversies, ripe and in need of geographical research"
2020-0070,2,"as we outline, papers in this issue contribute to the debate primarily by examining the role of the state, financial centres and uneven development in fintech"
2020-0035,0,"to mitigate environmental problems and to achieve sustainability, china is striving to transition to low-carbon urban economies"
2020-0035,1,"among several significant steps, the country has made remarkable success in controlling the emissions from transportation, buildings, and energy by shutting down or relocating several polluting industries"
2020-0035,2,this study contributes to the issue of sustainable growth debate using time series data from china for the period 19982017 and empirically examines the effects of green investment and renewable energy consumption on production-based carbon emissions for china
2020-0035,3,the strength of this study is that it tested some new variables such as production-based carbon emissions and green investment
2020-0035,4,"using autoregressive distributed lag model (ardl) cointegration technique, we found that production-based emission and its determinants move together in the long run"
2020-0035,5,"the study found that green investment and renewable energy consumption are both helpful in controlling production-based carbon emissions, while trade openness increases production-based carbon emissions"
2020-0035,6,"hence, green investment and renewable energy consumption contribute to the achievement of sustainable growth"
2020-0035,7,"moreover, based on a robustness check, human capital, financial development, and environment-specific technological innovation are found to be helpful in curbing production-based carbon emissions"
2020-0035,8,"our study recommends financial technology (fin-tech), green investment, and public-private partnership investment in renewable energy to mitigate the effect of production-based carbon emissions"
2020-0119,0,this paper analyses how different entrepreneurial actors respond to political uncertainty and changing institutional settings
2020-0119,1,"moreover, it discusses the impact of those actor-level responses on the resilience of entrepreneurial ecosystems (ees), focusing on how they affect the diversity of and the connectivity among its actors"
2020-0119,2,"to address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the united kingdom to leave the european union has influenced the financial technology (fintech) industry in london, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in londons fintech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies"
2020-0119,3,"our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an ee"
2020-0119,4,"moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks"
2020-0119,5,"with regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses"
2020-0034,0,blockchain is a buzzword describing the current excitement for an innovative technology that could change and disrupt major industries and economic sectors
2020-0034,1,"blockchain technology has the promise to change all existing business models and make financial services cheaper contributing therefore to a better financial inclusion and, even a better economic wealth distribution"
2020-0034,2,numerous studies optimistically praise such potential societal benefits by listing all processes that could be optimized through this technology
2020-0034,3,"however, the picture is not necessary all bright"
2020-0034,4,blockchain can indeed disrupt and significantly improve our societies but there still exist some societal costs in the way this technology is implemented
2020-0034,5,this paper provides a perspective overviewing of the current trends related to the development of the most widely used implementation of blockchain technology based on the proof-of-work consensus algorithm
2020-0034,6,these trends will be discussed in three steps: the good blockchain overviews how this technology can improve our societies
2020-0034,7,the bad blockchain offers a more nuanced perspective by discussing the potential polluting activities generated by some mining activities
2020-0034,8,"finally, the ugly blockchain investigates how this technology might generate a risk of concentration in the mining industry affecting therefore the nature and even the existence of the blockchain technology"
2020-0017,0,"blockchain, the underlying technology of digital currency, such as bitcoin, has the characteristics of decentralization, stability, security, anonymity, and nontampering"
2020-0017,1,blockchain is being applied in an increasing number of fields
2020-0017,2,supply chain finance is a financing model in which banks connect core enterprises with upstream and downstream enterprises to provide flexible financial products and services
2020-0017,3,"in the traditional supply chain finance, the core enterprises with strong competitiveness and a large scale play an irreplaceable role in managing the supply chain information flow, logistics, and capital flow, which results in inequality and information asymmetry"
2020-0017,4,fraud in supply chain finance is also very serious
2020-0017,5,"to solve the problems of the traditional supply chain finance, in this article, we build a new type of supply chain financial platform that uses blockchain technology to manage the whole process"
2020-0017,6,"this supply chain financial platform solves the problem of nontrust among the participants in the supply chain, improves the efficiency of the capital flow and information flow, reduces costs, and provides better financial services to the relevant parties in the supply chain"
2020-0017,7,"to protect users' privacy, we propose a new method of using homomorphic encryption in the blockchain to meet the needs of sensitive data privacy protection in supply chain financial scenarios"
2020-0054,0,fintech and digital financial services involve the delivery of financial products and services through technology
2020-0054,1,"fintech companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to big banks, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor"
2020-0054,2,"for many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in kenya, fintech is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid"
2020-0054,3,"while refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of fintech as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the global north to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support"
2020-0054,4,"through fintech, private citizens and groups in the global north are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion"
2020-0054,5,"while fintech remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans"
2020-0054,6,this paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through fintech are still distinguished largely by exclusion
2020-0054,7,"in so doing, this paper highlights a theoretical position that refugee governance is embedded in racial forms of capital accumulation and expropriation"
2020-0031,0,the rise of fintech challenges established financial centres and incumbent financial institutions to rethink their strategies to remain obligatory passage points in the age of digitizing finance
2020-0031,1,"to appreciate these changes, it is important to maintain theoretical interchange between developments in financial geography and economic geography, its parent discipline"
2020-0031,2,"in this paper, we argue that the ways in which evolutionary economic geography impacts strategic coupling in global financial networks are crucial to grasp tomorrows geographies of fintech"
2020-0031,3,"through an in-depth examination of brussels, we analyse the potential of fintech opening a window of locational opportunity in financial services"
2020-0031,4,belgium has put together a strategy to seize this window by leveraging its politically neutral image and brussels existing niche in financial collaboration and infrastructural plumbing
2020-0031,5,the latter status is exemplified by the presence of global players swift and euroclear
2020-0031,6,"we analyse how belgian entrepreneurs and politicians assess brussels locational resources, and strategically couple big financial institutions with small tech startups in order to cultivate a fintech ecosystem in the service of incumbent finance, constituting a fin-tech-state triangle"
2020-0031,7,"as such, we document and analyse how the coalescence of finance and technology offers new opportunities for second-tier financial centres, while highlighting the difficulties in reaping these in practice"
2020-0329,0,"this paper, proposed a mobile application that provides islamic finance options to clients using a special type of forwarding sale known as salam contract, the proposed system as well provides answers to client inquiries about the salam contract, such as cost of finance, quantity to be delivered as a payoff, and delivery place and time, the proposed system converting the traditional salam contract to e-salam contract to maximize the benefits and attractiveness of the modes, this approach required a complete electronic system can easily interact with the clients and execute the contract steps applying the required conditions of islamic sharia as well, this proposal provides digital application structure to be used by both islamic bank and clients easily and perfectly"
2020-0329,1,"hence, the proposed application helps applicants to provide the necessary information (financeable products, calculating the amount to be returned in the form of a quantity of the product, etc.)"
2020-0329,2,the proposal enables islamic banks to provide financial services to rural areas where no branches but internet service available
2020-0329,3,delivery points available in the system with specific locations to make it easy for farmers to fulfill the contract obligations

2020-0329,5,"the proposed system focus on possibilities, extra papers on experiments will follow in further papers"
2020-0246,0,"recently, there has been a strong wave of digital transformation to the banking sector worldwide"
2020-0246,1,"in this paper, we explore using one of the emerging technologies, being artificial intelligence, in banks in bahrain"
2020-0246,2,we find that only a few banks have utilized artificial intelligence applications and that the robotic process automation and chatbots are the most employed artificial intelligence applications
2020-0246,3,"furthermore, the findings highlight that the central bank of bahrain has given a high priority to the digital transformation journey in banks, which suggests that further development and implantation of technology in banks will be seen in the near future"
2020-0047,0,purpose: this study aims to explore the existing islamic financial technology (fintech) lending in indonesia
2020-0047,1,doing so is to better understand in what way the fintech firms have been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (sdgs) in the local context
2020-0047,2,design/methodology/approach: this study engages qualitative methods
2020-0047,3,this paper first reviews relevant literature related to fintech and establishes the substantive definition of islamic fintech
2020-0047,4,"further, the existing literature of sdgs is explored to understand its original idea and its recent implementation, particularly in indonesia"
2020-0047,5,"following this, the official reports from the domestic regulators are referred to select the fintech firms which meet the criteria of islamic fintech lending based on the proposed definition"
2020-0047,6,the selected firms are then analysed based on several themes which best capture their position in promoting the sdgs
2020-0047,7,"finally, the discussion is linked to the recent performance of indonesia in implementing sdgs"
2020-0047,8,"findings: this work finds that the reviewed fintech firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro enterprises (smes)"
2020-0047,9,"furthermore, the selected fintech firms are also found to collect and distribute islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and sadaqah (voluntary charity)"
2020-0047,10,"besides, the firms are also found to initiate charity programmes for underprivileged community"
2020-0047,11,"in some degree, these findings are synonymous of the firms effort in promoting sdg of ending poverty (sdg 1) and hunger (sdg 2) and reducing the inequalities (sdg 10)"
2020-0047,12,research limitations/implications: the discussion of this work does not provide any positivist generalisation due to the method used
2020-0047,13,practical implications: the indonesian government is advised to legally engage with the existing fintech firms and other related stakeholders to best solve its recent issue of the declining trend in sdg 15 (life on land)
2020-0047,14,social implications: this work elaborates in what way the islamic fintech lending has been promoting the sdgs in indonesian context
2020-0047,15,"in some extent, such discussion can best challenge the social issue of fintech which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah (harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in indonesia"
2020-0047,16,originality/value: this study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of islamic fintech and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of sdgs
2020-0330,0,the interesting thing about this paper is that the era of the covid-19 pandemic has brought big changes in all aspects of global life
2020-0330,1,"likewise, the fintech industry has produced digital product applications by providing comfortable user experience"
2020-0330,2,"the fintech user experience (ux) is in a fairly good position to adapt to the global world and during the covid-19 pandemic, online transactions have increased in use"
2020-0330,3,most of the fintech platforms are already in the online format
2020-0330,4,"however, the paradigm shift caused by the corona-virus forced the ux fintech sector to provide support for accelerating creative solutions to new problems in accelerating economic recovery during the covid 19 pandemic"
2020-0331,0,researchers have long pondered on the online banking transaction adoption
2020-0331,1,some of these studies focus primarily on the motivating factors that affect customers' intention to adopt/accept these services (technologies)
2020-0331,2,"however, research into the constraining factors, in particular socio-economic factors, barely exist in the literature, especially in the context of sub-saharan africa"
2020-0331,3,"against this background, the paper seeks to fill in this gap by: (1) assessing the socio-economic factors impeding the engagement of e-banking transactions among retail bank customers in ghana, and (2) examining the moderating effect of 'customer experience of internet' on the identified factors that inhibit the engagement in online banking in ghana"
2020-0331,4,the paper used a quantitative research approach to obtain data from two leading ghanaian banks
2020-0331,5,"out of the 450 questionnaires distributed, 393 were valid for analysis"
2020-0331,6,data were analyzed with the aid of pls-sem (partial least squares and structural equation modeling)
2020-0331,7,findings revealed that perceived knowledge gap and the price of digital devices were directly important to the intention to disembark on e-banking transactions among ghanaian bank customers
2020-0331,8,"whilst customer experience (frequent use of the internet), as a moderator variable, has a significant effect on the interaction between perceived knowledge gap and the intent to disembark on e-banking transactions"
2020-0331,9,and finance charges and the intent to disembark on e-banking transactions
2020-0331,10,study implications and directions for future research are discussed in the paper
2020-0332,0,"with the rise of financial technology startups (so called fintechs) and the adoption of open banking business models, the banking industry is witnessing revolutionary changes"
2020-0332,1,"to adopt these revolutionary changes, banks are collaborating with fintechs to develop innovative products and services for the customers"
2020-0332,2,"banks, which are ruled by conventional practices, have been using very secure and closed computer-based systems whereas building a fintech ecosystem requires integration to countless 3rd party software services (so called apis) in a secure and robust way"
2020-0332,3,this paper discusses the design and development of a fintech api gateway in terms of business needs and technical challenges
2020-0332,4,"additionally, business requirements, technical design decisions, development challenges and key performance metrics of the api gateway are discussed and explained in detail"
2020-0333,0,payment financial technology (fintech) has rapidly developed in indonesia
2020-0333,1,"in this case, payment fintech enables people to perform the transaction comfortably, such as for electricity bill payment, food ordering, and purchasing the game accessories"
2020-0333,2,"however, fintech payment emerges the issues to the customer as well"
2020-0333,3,"in this part, several problems are encountered by fintech payment system"
2020-0333,4,"in this background, the payment system in indonesia is regulated by the central bank"
2020-0333,5,"technically, the payment must comply with the four principles of payment system such as secure, effective, fairness, and customer protection"
2020-0333,6,"therefore, this quantitative research explores the four principles of payment system towards the intention of the fintech payment system, especially for ovo customers"
2020-0333,7,"spss application facilitates the process, and the linear regression technique applies to analyze the data based on the model"
2020-0333,8,the process is conducted partially and simultaneously
2020-0333,9,the partial result of the research indicates the efficiency variable and fairness variable that has a significant influence on the intention of the utilization
2020-0333,10,"however, the concurrent process for all variables presents a considerable result of the intention of the utilization factor"
2020-0333,11,the research results significantly contribute to future improvement feedback and development in the industry
2020-0245,0,"the emergence of new technologies and players, along with a favorable regulatory framework (psd2 directive), is changing the banking industry"
2020-0245,1,fintechs and techfins have allowed the introduction of new services and changed the way customers interact to satisfy their financial needs
2020-0245,2,the fintech landscape is constantly evolving in the market
2020-0245,3,"different business value propositions are entering the financial services industry, moving from increasing the user's experience to developing a time to market framework for banks to innovate products, processes, and channels, increasing the cost efficiency and looking for a partnering on order to lighten the regulatory burdens for banks"
2020-0245,4,"the many businesses of banks are changing their value chains, and banks' business models should do the same accordingly"
2020-0245,5,strategists could no longer take their value chains as a given
2020-0245,6,"choices have to be made on what needs to be protected and maintained, what abandoned and the new on coming to make banks evolve and become more resilient in doing their job"
2020-0245,7,"banking is shifting significantly from a pipeline, vertical paradigm, to open banking business models where open innovation, modularity, and ecosystem-based bank's business model may become the ongoing mainstream and paradigm to follow and develop"
2020-0245,8,opportunities and threats for banks are many and new ones to re-gaining their role in the market throughout a re-intermediation process
2020-0334,0,digital lending businesses have been flourishing recently in indonesia
2020-0334,1,"despite of its influence on the customer segments and competition arena that quite intimidating to traditional banking business model, it still seek maturity on its technology"
2020-0334,2,"automation become the key to gain maximum processing speed, but some aspects seems still not ready for it"
2020-0334,3,"while scoring model can be implemented using predictive machine learning algorithm, some customers background checking is still depends on third parties applications along with their maturity on the technology implementations"
2020-0334,4,another aspects we should continuosly enhance as part of internal process improvement effort is our loan origination system and its components that become the center of gravity of the ecosystem
2020-0334,5,"adoptions of high end mobile app technology, provide the players with chance to create seamless user experience that brought comfort to the customers when using their platform"
2020-0334,6,those all technology stack should be planned on early stage of digital lending system development
2020-0334,7,"roadmap should be build, reviewed and enhanced in order to track the improvements to keep up with the fast pace of technology adoption in the arena"
2020-0334,8,"proposed software system architecture in this paper is designed to be fit only in indonesia, aligned with its local regulations and some national entities (i.e"
2020-0334,9,"national single id server, local credit bureau) that must be included in the ecosystem"
2020-0335,0,in this article we review the contested effects of traditional payday loans on borrowers and describe recent regulatory changes to the product
2020-0335,1,we then provide detail on the institutional features and regulation-to the extent that there is any-of new products emerging to fill demand that remains when payday loans are more strictly regulated
2020-0335,2,little is known about the effects of these new loan products on borrowers
2020-0335,3,"what is certain is that state restrictions have led lenders to modify their loans to narrowly evade restrictions on interest rates, loan lengths, loan sizes, and repayment procedures like allowing loans to roll over"
2020-0335,4,"we focus on the starkest changes to small-dollar credit regulation that have occurred recently, including the development of high-interest installment loans, so-called flex loans offered by payday lenders, and the fintech creation of earned wage advance products"

2020-0336,0,the current pandemic situation has opened requirements for getting maximum support not only from government bodies but also from general public and nonprofit organizations
2020-0336,1,aiding a non-profit organization with financial aspects is a common concern due to lack of transparency in flow of funds taking place for the indicated social issues
2020-0336,2,there is an immediate need for a channel or mechanism to support and validate the cash flow in such scenarios
2020-0336,3,"in this paper, we explore the generic issues in this topic and propose our idea to solve the same"
2020-0336,4,"this paper talks about a financial platform backed by a bank x, that channelizes, reports and provides earmarked funds from charity accounts of donors (just like a regular fixed deposit account online interface) to accounts of non-profitable government organizations (ngos) aka beneficiaries (irrespective of banks)"
2020-0336,5,"this significantly solves the challenge posed by lack of transparency and accountability on the part of ngos and dramatically increases donor confidence and thereby the number of donors, average donation size and frequency"
2020-0337,0,"in this paper, the authors first introduce a theory-based course development framework that organically combines learner-centered design, backward design, project-based learning, and universal design for learning"
2020-0337,1,the authors then describe their design considerations in the developing of an introduction to fintech course following the proposed framework
2020-0337,2,qualitative data gathered from interviews with students who took the course and the course developer was analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the developed course
2020-0337,3,the results suggest that the proposed framework is well suited for the introduction to fintech course
2020-0337,4,"a list of best practices, along with potential improvements drawn from the data analysis, are presented"
2020-0337,5,"the primary contribution of the paper is the proposed theory-based course development framework, which is flexible and can be easily adapted to guide the design and development of computing courses in various subjects"
2020-0159,0,"the covid-19 pandemic has created an environment of uncertainty, stress and financial vulnerability"
2020-0159,1,"as countries all over the world adopted preventive strategies ranging from voluntary isolations to stringent lockdowns, people and businesses were required to adjust their dispositions to the new normal resulting in new behaviors"
2020-0159,2,the customer behaviour in financial services was also impacted and especially in developing economies as people were required to move to digital financial platforms at haste
2020-0159,3,"in recent times, fintech services are on a steady rise globally but their presence in the emerging markets is in a nascent stage and adoption by the low-income segment customers has largely been elusive"
2020-0159,4,much work is required to understand the needs of this customer cohort to identify factors for product adoption
2020-0159,5,this study investigates the impact on financial behavior among low-income segment customers for fintech services due to the pandemic
2020-0159,6,"by testing a set of hypotheses regarding inclination to adopt fintech the study presents prominent antecedents such as fear, social influence, awareness and trust that led to positive product adoption"
2020-0159,7,the study discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of the study and presents direction for future research
2020-0338,0,financial technology (fintech) expands financial services to many people that are currently lacking access where customers enjoy using banking products and services provided by non-banking providers
2020-0338,1,"fintech changes the way people pay, send money, borrow, lend, and invest"
2020-0338,2,fintech enables financial solutions and innovative business models resulting the fusion of finance and smart mobile technology
2020-0338,3,the emergence of fintech-related products causes major disruptions in financial services
2020-0338,4,"though it is yet far from replacing current financial services, it offers financial products and services by non-financial sectors into automation, user-friendly, efficient, and transparent just like banking and financial sectors"
2020-0338,5,"the paper discusses its concept, characteristics, and some case studies of local fintech in indonesia"
2020-0338,6,"in addition, the study deployed text mining analysis to find out the correlation and patterns of fintechs characteristics"
2020-0338,7,then the case analysis highlights a comparative assessment between local fintech in indonesia versus global fintech players within local market-based completion
2020-0338,8,the findings suggest that local fintech organizations can be resilient competing with an international fintech players

2020-0340,0,"nowadays, banks are experiencing a period in which financial technology is changing the fundamental concepts of banking products"
2020-0340,1,the first step that every bank should take is proper investment in financial technologies
2020-0340,2,"instead of kazakhstani banks, however, it is the government that is making huge efforts to develop the fintech market"
2020-0340,3,"the goal of this review paper is to evaluate the development of the fintech market of kazakhstan and demonstrate the inefficiency of investments for the main industry of the financial market, namely, kazakhstani second-tier banks"
2020-0340,4,review of studies on kazakhstan's fintech market development made along with testing the hypothesis that government investments have no relationship with bank revenues
2020-0340,5,"a relationship analysis was conducted between on the one hand fintech investments in kazakhstan and on the other hand revenues from account management, revenues from lending and financing, revenues from payments, and revenues from financial assets and capital markets of the banking industry of kazakhstan and the us"
2020-0340,6,"the analysis showed the weakest relationship of fintech investments in kazakhstan to revenues from lending and financing for kazakhstan and equally weak relationship to revenues from account management, revenues from payments, and revenues from financial assets and capital markets"
2020-0340,7,"in addition, analysis shows that all four types of revenue have a strong relationship with investment for the us and correlation analysis resulted in the strongest relationship to revenues from payments for the us"
2020-0340,8,analysis points out positive relationship of investments to fintech market of us and reverse state for kazakhstan
2020-0340,9,findings: the level of penetration of fintech in the kazakhstani market is markedly below that of developed economies
2020-0340,10,investments in fintech are more income efficient for us banks than is the case with kazakhstani banks
2020-0340,11,kazakhstan's financial market mostly consists of commercial banks and efforts to develop the fintech market largely sourced from the government have no relation with bank incomes
2020-0158,0,"every second, fraud detection systems (fds) check streams of thousands of credit or debit card transactions"
2020-0158,1,"most of the models in production and in the literature rely on batch learning, wasting part of the most recent data"
2020-0158,2,incremental learning may be beneficial in terms of compu-tational/architectural cost and confidentiality (e.g
2020-0158,3,avoiding the storage of sensitive data)
2020-0158,4,"the full paper focuses on two questions related to the use of incremental learning for fds: (1) can incremental learning be as competitive as batch and retraining approaches? (2) can combining incremental, ensembles, diversity, and transfer learning lead to efficient models under concept drift? we investigate those elements and provide an experimental evaluation on a real-life case study including more than 150 days of e-commerce transactions (or 50 million transactions)"
2020-0341,0,financial technology (fintech) has emerged as a potentially transformative force in the various financial segments
2020-0341,1,"to track this new sector garnering investor attention, keefe, bruyette & woods and nasdaq, came up with kbw nasdaq financial technology index (kftx) on july 18, 2016 comprising of 49 constituents"
2020-0341,2,"the objective of this paper is to compare kftx performance with the leading market indices, including s&p 500 and dow jones industrial average index"
2020-0341,3,"the data is collected for a period of 12 months, 24 months and 34 months starting from july 18, 2016"
2020-0341,4,"the findings of the analysis suggest that the returns for kftx are consistently higher for 12 months, 24 months and 34 months over s&p 500 and dow jones industrial average"
2020-0341,5,the cross section analysis of the 48 kftx index constituents sub-classified into eight categories representing several different financial industry groups and businesses indicate that for the 34 months period networks and payments gave returns of 82.1% and 71.6% whereas asset management business gave an average negative return of - 51.0% and the specialty marketplace lenders gave a return of 26.6%
2020-0341,6,this indicates a significant non-uniform growth within the fintech industry
2020-0341,7,the findings motivate for an in-depth analysis of the various industry groups and businesses within the fintech industry and to explore further the reasons and attributes which differentiate these sectors
2020-0341,8,"the study has implications for policy makers, asset management companies and investors in terms of understanding and framing policies for fintech investments"
2020-0342,0,"the advancement of digital technology in the industrial 4.0 era has impacted the growth of economic and financial crime, especially financial technology, or fintech"
2020-0342,1,it was not followed by legal development to overcome these impacts
2020-0342,2,"therefore, to overcome a gap in financial crime that uses digital technology as a tool in committing crimes, new effective and efficient concepts and methods are needed"
2020-0342,3,one fitting theory is the notion of following the money utilizing the method of a financial crime investigation
2020-0342,4,this approach uses investigative audit and forensic accounting to trace assets over the profits of the crime
2020-0342,5,"however, to implement the method, it is necessary to modify the substance of the legal system to shift the orientation from the orientation of proof of error to proving the proceeds of crime"
2020-0342,6,"the article finds that in the aspect of structure, a synergistic and harmonious coordination system is needed between law enforcers and all related parties"
2020-0342,7,"while in the aspect of legal culture, the development of community economic infrastructure is needed, especially business transactions that support data-based systems"
2020-0181,0,an asset allocation optimization model for key clients and financial products is developed and deployed on a business platform by compiling a program to a module using matlab to show how to integrate financial big data and fintech in a real application for a bank
2020-0181,1,"firstly, we establish a single objective linear programming model with the percent of assets in products as the decision variables, the minimum-weighted duration as the objective, and the business requirements as constraints"
2020-0181,2,"then, we select non-integer linear programming as the model solver by testing two algorithm solvers with six real test cases separately, according to the solving time"
2020-0181,3,"finally, we directly compile the model and the algorithm program into a module to complete the deployment into a business platform to quickly complete the transformation of data and model the actual productivity of the bank"
2020-0096,0,"after the 200708 global financial crisis, research flourished on entrepreneurship through digital innovation in the financial market as well as on investors influence on digital technology-based entrepreneurs funding decisions"
2020-0096,1,"this study combines these two research streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital entrepreneurship, technology, and banking"
2020-0096,2,the study first uses prior literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria in funding
2020-0096,3,"except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in different markets, andas with most digital business modelsscalability was identified as a key criterion"
2020-0096,4,"additionally, by serving as a major provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs"
2020-0096,5,"through developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders in fintechs and, hence, equity investors"
2020-0096,6,"we also describe how these formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements, digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration"
2020-0343,0,"to determine the micro-operating mechanism(mom) of enterprises participating in the regulatory sandbox policy in fintech, this study analyzes the structure of enterprise innovation competencies and derives relevant implications"
2020-0343,1,"the results reveal that large, middle-standing, and small and medium-sized enterprises focus on security, infrastructure, and user-related technology development, respectively, to enhance their innovation competencies"
2020-0343,2,the security-related issues considered by large enterprises entail relatively high costs in initial technology development and are closely related to infrastructure building
2020-0343,3,"large enterprises are focused on developing overall security-related technologies, whereas middle-standing enterprises are striving to develop infrastructure-related technologies, with particular emphasis on elementary technologies"
2020-0343,4,small and medium-sized enterprises are also making efforts to develop user-centered technologies that can directly be used in fintech
2020-0343,5,"as a method to implement regulatory sandboxes tailored to the needs of participating enterprises in south korea, this study will help to determine the mom of such participants and establish strategies to support them sustainably in terms of evidence-based policy"
2020-0344,0,this article engages with the critical study of contemporary publicity by examining transparency as a strategic project to platformize financial services
2020-0344,1,the article contributes to understandings of transparency as value cocreation in business-to-business markets
2020-0344,2,"through field-level discourse analysis, the article shows that transparency is contingent primarily on the nature of the market, in this case, a platformized industry, which valorizes transparency as part of a regime of data sharing and open access"
2020-0344,3,transparency is further contingent on the market actor: actors with lesser status and market legitimacy are more likely to seek to cocreate transparency with market actors of greater or similar status and legitimacy
2020-0344,4,"the article concludes that in commercial spaces, publicitys relationship to transparency is not only determined by market logic, but that all market logics are being drawn further toward a technological definition of transparency as shareveillance, as more segments of economic life become platformized"
2020-0148,0,the implementation of payment services directive 2 (psd2) has radically changed the regulatory environment for providing payment services in the european economic area
2020-0148,1,the main objective of the study is to determine the impact of psd2 on the number of newly established paytech companies
2020-0148,2,the second objective is to explain the factors driving the distribution of psd2-licensed entities across the european union countries
2020-0148,3,the difference-in-difference method and the poisson regression model served our empirical analysis
2020-0148,4,the results show that the adoption of psd2 in november 2015 caused a rapid but temporary surge in paytech start-ups in europe
2020-0148,5,"after national transpositions of the directive, the number of new entrants fell in 2018"
2020-0148,6,"however, it remained at a higher level than before the adoption of psd2, which indicates its positive impact"
2020-0148,7,"the analysis has proved that market potential, the characteristics of payment systems, including the popularity of payment cards, and the public environment for fintech start-ups provided by the authorities significantly affected the number of psd2 licences issued"
2020-0148,8,"the introduction of the psd2 has made the size of the domestic market play a smaller role, as paytechs can operate on a pan-european level also while based in a smaller country"
2020-0148,9,the importance of an open business environment has increased and offering regulatory sandboxes has proven to effectively support the development of the paytech sector
2020-0041,0,"using data from chinese commercial banks between 2008 and 2017, this paper explores the effects of bank fintech on credit risk"
2020-0041,1,we first construct and measure a bank fintech index using web crawler technology and word frequency analysis
2020-0041,2,the results show that the development of bank fintech is faster in state-owned banks than in other banks
2020-0041,3,"moreover, among the five subareas of bank fintech, the development of internet technology is ahead of artificial intelligence technology, blockchain technology, cloud computing technology, and big data technology"
2020-0041,4,"then, the impacts of bank fintech on credit risk are examined"
2020-0041,5,"we find that bank fintech significantly reduces credit risk in chinese commercial banks, and further analyses show that the negative effects of bank fintech on credit risk are relatively weak among large banks, state-owned banks, and listed banks"
2020-0040,0,"in this paper, we propose a novel approach to examine the risk spillovers between fintech firms and traditional financial institutions, during a time of fast technological advances"
2020-0040,1,based on the stock returns of u.s
2020-0040,2,"financial and fintech institutions, we estimate pairwise risk spillovers by using the granger causality test across quantiles"
2020-0040,3,"we consider the whole distribution: the left tail (bearish case), the right tail (bullish case) and the center of the distribution and construct three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center) and obtain network-based spillover indicators"
2020-0040,4,we find that linkages in the network are stronger in the bearish case when the risk of spillover is higher
2020-0040,5,fintech institutions' risk spillover to financial institutions positively correlates with financial institutions' increase in systemic risk
2020-0040,6,"these results have important policy implications, as they underscore the importance of enhancing the supervision and regulation of fintech companies, to maintain financial stability"
2020-0075,0,"purpose: the purpose of this study is to define fintech, differentiating it from financial technology and use the definition to develop an industry framework"
2020-0075,1,"design/methodology/approach: using the existing literature on fintech and incorporating these contributions into a traditional financial structure, characteristics are outlined and placed into a framework that describes the fintech industry"
2020-0075,2,"findings: fintech is a specific type of financial technology, defined as technology used to provide financial markets a financial product or financial service, characterized by sophisticated technology relative to existing technology in that market"
2020-0075,3,firms that primarily use fintech are classified as fintech firms
2020-0075,4,"using these definitions, the paper provides a structure for the fintech industry, classifying each type of fintech firm by fintech characteristics"
2020-0075,5,research limitations/implications: research that would inform the economic importance of fintech would be served with an increased understanding of fintech firms and the fintech industry
2020-0075,6,originality/value: this paper contributes by defining fintech and developing a comprehensive framework to describe the emerging fintech industry
2020-0057,0,purpose: this paper reviews recent advances in the empirical literature of fintech and household finance
2020-0057,1,"design/methodology/approach: we survey the effects of fintech on three different aspects of household finance: payments, lending and portfolio decisions"
2020-0057,2,"specifically, we examine the impact of digital payments, mobile money, fintech lending, marketplace lending, robo-advising and crowd-funding"
2020-0057,3,findings: studies suggest that fintech has positively benefited households by increasing consumption and borrowing
2020-0057,4,this allows them to smoothen their consumption across time
2020-0057,5,"furthermore, there is an improvement in their portfolio diversification"
2020-0057,6,"nonetheless, there is also evidence that certain households overconsume and borrow beyond their means"
2020-0057,7,"originality/value: despite the importance of this topic, there has been a lack of empirical evidence until recently"
2020-0057,8,"in this paper, we take stock of the empirical evidence in the literature through the lens of household finance"
2020-0207,0,"defi (decentralized finance) has joined fintech (financial technology), regtech (regulatory technology), cryptocurrencies, and digital assets as one of the most discussed emerging technological evolutions in global finance"
2020-0207,1,"yet little is really understood about its meaning, legal implications, and policy consequences"
2020-0207,2,"in this article we introduce defi, put defi in the context of the traditional financial economy, connect defi to open banking, and end with some policy considerations"
2020-0207,3,we suggest that decentralization has the potential to undermine traditional forms of accountability and erode the effectiveness of traditional financial regulation and enforcement
2020-0207,4,"at the same time, we find that where parts of the financial services value chain are decentralized, there will be a reconcentration in a different (but possibly less regulated, less visible, and less transparent) part of the value chain"
2020-0207,5,"defi regulation could, and should, focus on this reconcentrated portion of the value chain to ensure effective oversight and risk control"
2020-0207,6,"rather than eliminating the need for regulation, in fact defi requires regulation in order to achieve its core objective of decentralization"
2020-0207,7,"furthermore, defi potentially offers an opportunity for the development of an entirely new way to design regulation: the idea of embedded regulation"
2020-0207,8,"regulatory approaches could be built into the design of defi, thus potentially decentralizing both finance and its regulation, in the ultimate expression of regtech"
2020-0151,0,"purpose: drawing from the argument that mobile money services have a significant potential to provide a wide range of affordable, convenient and secure financial services, there have been rampant frauds on consumers of financial products over the digital financial platform"
2020-0151,1,"thus, this study aims to establish the mediating effect of digital consumer protection in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion with data collected from micro small and medium enterprises (msmes) in northern uganda"
2020-0151,2,"design/methodology/approach: to achieve the main objective of this study, a research model was developed to test for the mediating effect of digital consumer protection in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion"
2020-0151,3,the data were collected from msmes and structural equation modelling in partial least square (pls) combined with bootstrap was applied to analyze and test the hypotheses of this study
2020-0151,4,the direct and indirect effect of mobile money adoption and usage on financial inclusion was tested through digital consumer protection as a mediator variable
2020-0151,5,findings: the findings from the pls-structural equation modelling (sem) showed that mobile money adoption and usage has both direct and indirect effect on financial inclusion
2020-0151,6,"moreover, financial inclusion is influenced by both mobile money adoption and usage and digital consumer protection"
2020-0151,7,research limitations/implications: the study used partial least square (pls-sem) combined with bootstrap confidence intervals through a formative approach to establish the mediating effect of the mediator variable
2020-0151,8,"hence, it ignored the use of covariance-based sem and the medgraph programme"
2020-0151,9,"furthermore, data were collected from samples located in gulu district, northern uganda and specifically from msmes"
2020-0151,10,this limits generalization of the study findings to other population who also use mobile money services
2020-0151,11,"practical implications: promoters of digital financial services, managers of telecommunication companies, and financial inclusion advocates should consider strengthening the existing digital consumer protection laws on the mobile money platform"
2020-0151,12,"a collaborative approach between the mobile network operators, financial institutions and regulators should tighten the existing laws against mobile money fraudsters and an efficient mechanism for recourse, compensation and remedy should be set up to benefit the victims of frauds and cybercrime on the fintech ecosystem"
2020-0151,13,originality/value: the current study gives a useful insight into the critical mediating role of digital consumer protection as a cushion for promoting financial inclusion through mobile phones over the fintech that face great threat and risk from cyber insecurity
2020-0206,0,"automated financial advising (robo-advising) has become an established practice in wealth management, yet very few studies have looked at the cross-section of the robo-advisors and the factors explaining the persistent variability in their portfolio allocation recommendations"
2020-0206,1,"using a sample of 53 advising platforms from the us and germany, we show that the underlying algorithms manage to identify different risk profiles, although substantial variability is evident even within the same investor types' groups"
2020-0206,2,"the robo-advisor expertise in a particular asset class seems to play a significant role, as does the geographical location, while the breadth of the offered investment choice (number of portfolios) across the robo-advisors under study does not seem to have an effect"
2020-0037,0,financial technologies (fintech) are proposed to expand access to financial services in rural communities as bank branches decline
2020-0037,1,"however, poor rural communities and rural communities of color have limited access to high-speed internet connections required for fintech"
2020-0037,2,leveraging the universe of u.s
2020-0037,3,"rural zip codes, this paper investigates associations between communities poverty rates, racial makeup, and rates of fintech"
2020-0037,4,poor rural communities of color experience digital redlining by having the lowest fintech rates
2020-0037,5,"rural communities increasing white population is associated with higher high-speed internet rates, an advantage of whiteness observable even in the presence of high poverty"
2020-0037,6,implications are discussed
2020-0244,0,"fintech has significantly expanded the offer of financial services available to users, facilitating the spread of new financing, payment and exchange services in increasingly large sections of the population"
2020-0244,1,"however, there is a downside, represented by the lack of organic regulation that defines the perimeter of legality"
2020-0244,2,"world legislators, europeans in particular, have started building a structured legal framework and to prevent (or to catch) opportunistic or criminal behaviors"
2020-0244,3,among the unavoidable challenges for the anti-money laundering system are those related to the development of fintech which produces significant volumes of transactions
2020-0244,4,in this paper it is provided a systematic review of a) the most common money laundering patterns
2020-0244,5,"b) the european anti-money laundering legal framework, and c) the most recent and relevant fraud cases detected by the enforcements agencies"
2020-0244,6,the main objective of this research is to verify whether the behavior of economic players within the fintech sector can be contained within the limits of legality
2020-0244,7,"another objective, far from secondary, is to analyze the current patterns that lead to money laundering, also verifying whether there are tools, within the fintech itself, capable of exploiting technologies and identifying dark or illegal practices"
2020-0244,8,the recent case study of scandals within the fintech industry further helps to support the hypotheses and conclusions of the research itself
2020-0345,0,"in the past decade, it stated that the discourse on sustainable development and the financial technology(fintech) role in the financial and banking industries, has attention on researchers, practitioners, regulators, and policymakers"
2020-0345,1,the real problem arises from the discourse on whether fintech has an effect on sustainable development in the financial and banking industry in indonesia
2020-0345,2,this discourse needed to be understood better and more deeply
2020-0345,3,"for credible research results, it is necessary to use a mixedmethod research approach"
2020-0345,4,"this research aims to develop a model that will help uncover the phenomenon of fintech to sustainable development in the financial and banking industry in indonesia, using mixed methods research"
2020-0345,5,"in this study, exploratory sequential mixed method used as a type of mixedmethod approach"
2020-0345,6,"the main results of this study reveal that fintech, which is influenced by business drivers, has a significant role in sustainable development in the financial and banking industry in indonesia"
2020-0345,7,the contribution of this research can provide insight and understanding for researchers and practitioners in the financial and banking industry who want to implement a sustainable development model based on fintech in more depth
2020-0346,0,"as you know, the covid-19 pandemic has impacted most of the world's economies, the financial sector, and the development of financial technology software tools"
2020-0346,1,today fintech projects are drivers of the development of the financial sector
2020-0346,2,there are prerequisites for the development and implementation of financial technologies in kazakhstan
2020-0346,3,"first, the development of fintech is a global trend driven by technological progress, the growth of e-commerce, socio-demographic changes and banking restrictions"
2020-0346,4,"in this sense, kazakhstan is rapidly moving in line with global trends, in 2019 it showed outstanding results"
2020-0346,5,"secondly, according to the kpmg study on the impact of covid-19 on the economy of kazakhstan, almost all respondents paid attention to the need to develop online technologies in their organizations"
2020-0346,6,"the trend will be solutions for working with big data, allowing you to create personal offers for customers, minimize risks, manage production, and intracelomic conditions"
2020-0004,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to clarify theory and identify factors that could explain the level of fintech continuance intentions with an expectation confirmation model that integrates self-efficacy theory
2020-0004,1,"design/methodology/approach: with data collected from 753 fintech users, this study applies partial least square structural equation modeling to compare and select the research model with the most predictive power"
2020-0004,2,"findings: the results show that financial self-efficacy, technological self-efficacy and confirmation positively affect perceived usefulness"
2020-0004,3,"among these factors, financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy have both direct and indirect effects through confirmation on perceived usefulness"
2020-0004,4,perceived usefulness and confirmation are positively related to satisfaction
2020-0004,5,"finally, perceived usefulness and satisfaction positively influence fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0004,6,"originality/value: to the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies that investigates the effect of domain-specific self-efficacy on fintech continuance intentions, which enriches the existing research on fintech and deepens our understanding of users' fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0004,7,we distinguish between financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy and specify the relationship between self-efficacy and continuance intentions
2020-0004,8,"moreover, this study highlights the importance of assessing a model's predictive power using the plspredict technique and provides a reference for model selection"
2020-0347,0,"nowadays, fundraising is one of the most important issues for both fintech investors and startups"
2020-0347,1,"the pattern of fundraising in terms of ""number and type of rounds and stages needed"" are important"
2020-0347,2,the diverse features and factors that could stem from fintech business models which can influence success are of the key issues in shaping these patterns
2020-0347,3,this study applied the top 100 kpmg fintech startups' data to extract clusters and fundraising pattern using sequential pattern discovery for each cluster
2020-0347,4,this led to the extraction of seven distinct clusters using 3 different clustering algorithms from 3 to 7 different rounds of investment for each cluster
2020-0347,5,the proposed frequent patterns can assist both investors and fintech startups to show the future fundraising pattern based on their new or current startup cluster type and the ongoing stages of development
2020-0205,0,initial coin offerings (icos) are blockchain-based crowdfunding ventures to facilitate access to capital
2020-0205,1,"blockchain technology promises to solve many present-day problems, however, in the past three years, a diminished crypto-currency activity and fraudulent undertakings have raised some concerns"
2020-0205,2,"using a novel, hand-collected dataset, we study a range of characteristics of us-based ico tokens, starting with the first token launched in 2015 till december 2019"
2020-0205,3,"the price of ico tokens was at its highest in 2017, followed by a sharp decline in 2018 and a slow recovery since"
2020-0205,4,presence of know-your-customer (kyc) and white-list due diligence procedures can be associated with an ico receiving a higher rating from experts and a higher level of social media followers
2020-0205,5,"on the other hand, an ico's utilization of an incentive program, such as offering bonuses and bounties, is associated with higher rating by experts, but a lower level of social media following"
2020-0205,6,"following the 2018 cryptocurrency slump, teams have increased the percentage of tokens kept in lock-up to prevent large market supplies that result in a slump as before and to signal their long-term commitment to the project"
2020-0205,7,"icos' ratings and prices show contradictory characteristics, where blockchain infrastructure, healthcare, and marketplace domain tokens attracted lowest prices while being rated the highest, whereas the converse was true for energy tokens"
2020-0201,0,"new financial technology holds the promise of innovation and competition, challenging established products and services and frequently improving market processes"
2020-0201,1,"however, regulation of these new services faces a double challenge: to keep pace with innovation and facilitate new market entries while at the same time understanding and managing the regulatory risks that are involved"
2020-0201,2,"at this stage, the existing eu regulatory framework is of little help: the bulk of the present body of financial regulation stems from a different time, with different regulatory problems in mind"
2020-0201,3,eu regulation is also very slow to change and to adapt
2020-0201,4,"therefore, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox""- an experimentation space - as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive"
2020-0201,5,"a sandbox would allow market participants to test fintech services in the real market, with real consumers, but under the close scrutiny of the supervisor"
2020-0201,6,"the benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market""cycle of financial innovation, while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection"
2020-0201,7,"at the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a technical field which is sometimes poorly understood, both for firms and for the regulator"
2020-0201,8,this would help to reduce the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants
2020-0201,9,"in the particular eu legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward"
2020-0201,10,"in this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the eu member states, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by eu institutions"
2020-0201,11,"this innovative approach would be somewhat uncharted territory for the eu, and thereby also contribute to the future development of eu financial market governance as a whole"
2020-0348,0,management of technology and innovation (mot) can contribute to competitiveness of industries including banking and financial services insurance (bfsi)
2020-0348,1,technological innovations such as fintech are rapidly transforming bfsi and have major competitiveness implications for legacy players
2020-0348,2,key objective of our study is to understand the dimensions of innovation and identify options-particularly one based on mot for sustainability-for firms in emerging countries
2020-0348,3,"we adapt a mixed method approach, where analysis of factual secondary data will be complemented by insights from literature review and experts"
2020-0348,4,"factual views indicate significant role of regional banks of indian origin (bios), some of them are innovating quite well leveraging capabilities of increasing competitiveness of software (sw or ict) firms and fintech ventures, including service, product and platform innovations"
2020-0348,5,"we analyse the patterns of competitiveness using alternate frameworks of competitiveness from porter diamond to competitiveness assets-processes-performance (app), focusing on trends for fintech's trying to leverage artificial intelligence (ai) and 'digital transformation'"
2020-0348,6,"findings indicate major disruptive threats to incumbent 'banking, financial services and insurance'(bfsi) majors in many emerging countries from fintech as well as technology giants such as gafa"
2020-0348,7,"while efforts in countries such as india through 'unified payment interface (upi)' may address issues of financial access, evolving a dominant design demands much bigger 'architectural innovation'"
2020-0348,8,we draw implications for different stakeholders and also suggest topics for further research
2020-0348,9,paper contributes to practice of mot and theory on multiple dimensions
2020-0349,0,"this paper establishes a model for the integration of financial technology for digital business that involved in the business, educational, government and financial sectors, with a high component of digital marketing"
2020-0349,1,"the establishment of the model is based on knowledge management considering the relationships between the different capitals, the phases in which knowledge is transformed and the roles of the knowledge nodes"
2020-0349,2,"to integrate financial technology with government, business and university nodes, different indicators, dimensions, variables and interrelationships of knowledge management and transfer models are considered for digital businesses related to finance and digital marketing are considered"
2020-0349,3,"using the delphi method, a model testing strategy is proposed through the qualification of the relationships and the values taken by the variables, according to the perspective of a group of experts in the area, who provide their knowledge and experience, through collecting opinions"
2020-0065,0,"despite high expectations for the growth of fintech, it has not reached the expected growth in the real world"
2020-0065,1,"as fintech is innovative but inherently unpredictable, customers are still hesitant to adopt and use fintech, which ultimately affects its growth"
2020-0065,2,"to achieve the sustainable development and growth of fintech, an in-depth investigation of fintech continuance intentions is required"
2020-0065,3,"to investigate continuous-use behavior in a fintech context, this study focuses on two relevant issues: uncertainty and information technology (it) quality"
2020-0065,4,uncertainty is more critical in fintech than in traditional e-banking transactions because fintech transactions are complicated and less predictable
2020-0065,5,it quality is also crucial to fintech success because it plays a key role in fintech transactions
2020-0065,6,"this study mainly explores the relationship between uncertainty and it quality, both of which significantly affect fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0065,7,"for the purpose, we integrated an it quality-based perspective with a trust-based model to investigate fintech continuance intentions"
2020-0065,8,"our results demonstrate that system quality is negatively related to perceived risk, whereas information quality is positively related to trust"
2020-0065,9,service quality is the most important quality factor for controlling uncertainty and encouraging continued use of fintech
2020-0065,10,we found a more extended role of it in fintech than in other digital services
2020-0065,11,"this study provides fintech providers with the practical guidance in the design and implementation of fintech innovation, thereby achieving the sustainable development of fintech"
2020-0115,0,"one of the fundamental questions in asset pricing is why different assets earn different average returns? in this paper, we designed an autoencoder based asset pricing model to explain the return difference among the stocks in an index"
2020-0115,1,the trained autoencoder generates a set of latent representations that constitutes a combined -communal- factor to better explains a large portion of the return differences among the stocks in an index
2020-0115,2,"after analyzing all the stocks in s&p-500, russel-3000, and nasdaq-100, we found that our proposed latent factor model outperforms many other factor models in predicting the next day's return"
2020-0115,3,"notably, the experiment results show that on average non-communal stocks earn 0.05% over communal stocks"
2020-0115,4,"however, the risk associated with this non-communal stock is also 0.8% higher than communal stocks"
2020-0115,5,the experiments confirm that the superior performance comes from the compensation of high risk associated with these non-communal stocks
2020-0115,6,investors will benefit from our latent factor model to identify these communal and non-communal stocks for a high return while diversifying their asset portfolio
2020-0200,0,this study examines the difference between the fintechs that received private equity and venture capital funds and those that did not
2020-0200,1,"we test this with a sample of 2,524 companies across 76 countries over 20082018"
2020-0200,2,"we show a positive relationship between having received an angel and a seed round with follow-on financing, and a negative relationship with having a single founder"
2020-0200,3,the impact of the seed financing and the single founder is weaker in an emerging market
2020-0200,4,"furthermore, companies in financing and payments categories are more likely to receive funding"
2020-0005,0,we develop a hypothesis that the growth of financial technology (fintech) negatively influences bank performance
2020-0005,1,"we study the indonesia market, where fintech growth has been impressive"
2020-0005,2,"using a sample of 41 banks and data on fintech firms, we show that the growth of fintech firms negatively influences bank performance"
2020-0005,3,"we test our hypothesis through multiple additional tests and robustness tests, such as sensitivity to bank characteristics, effects of the global financial crisis, and the use of alternative estimators"
2020-0005,4,our main conclusion that fintech negatively predicts bank performance holds
2020-0080,0,financial technology (fintech) has gained a lot of attention and popularity in recent past years
2020-0080,1,some researchers blame it for disrupting financial ecosystem and while others admire it for redefining traditional business models
2020-0080,2,"according to the statista report 2018, transaction value in the crowdfunding segment amounts to us$ 5,250 mn in 2018"
2020-0080,3,the aim of this study is to investigate the influence of fintech applications and crowdfunding on customer retention in islamic banks of malaysia and the united arab emirates
2020-0080,4,a structured questionnaire consisting of 31 items was designed to gather data from 535 customers of selected banks from both countries through strata sampling
2020-0080,5,various statistical tests were done to check the association between fintech applications including crowdfunding and customer retention using spss 25.0
2020-0080,6,"the results indicated that financing application of fintech has no relevance to customer retention while as other variables such as payments, advisory services, compliance and crowdfunding has an impact on retaining customers in islamic banks of these two countries"
2020-0080,7,the conclusion of this study emphasis on expanding the range of applications of fintech services by islamic banks so that the customer will stay longer with the bank
2020-0080,8,"also, crowdfunding should be integrated into the islamic banking system so that it can help in social entrepreneurship, micro-finance and establishing global zakah and sadaqa system"
2020-0116,0,"recognising the economic value of london hosting 17 of the worlds top 50 fintech firms, hm treasurys strategy is determined to ensure britain remains the best place in the world to set up and grow a fintech business"
2020-0116,1,"the financial conduct authoritys sandbox regime has attracted fintech start-ups from around the world to test their technology and business with supervision and regulatory protections, providing an opportunity to grow into major businesses"
2020-0116,2,"the success of the intuitive sandbox has however led to it being replicated in jurisdictions worldwide, eager to benefit from the growth of fintech"
2020-0116,3,competition for high-calibre start-ups means the uks post-brexit sandbox may need to go further than its existing fintech sector strategy to continuing attracting and developing firms helping the city of london to remain the global centre of finance as perceived in the uks industrial strategy
2020-0116,4,"the article examines existing regulations and analyses how the uk can develop an enhanced structure to both further attract and accommodate legitimate high-calibre fintech entrepreneurs, whilst offering strong client and investor protections to ensure financial stability"
2020-0116,5,"it proposes unprecedented legal and policy reforms for the sandbox structure, including a permissible model to capitalise on funding from amateur private investors worldwide"
2020-0085,0,"purpose: the gradual implementation of blockchain technology in peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platforms facilitates safer, transparent and quick access to funds without having to deal with the more complex and costly processes of banks"
2020-0085,1,"beyond that, the purpose of this paper is to examine trust-enhancing heuristics that show a need for blockchain to assist in monitoring and bad loan recovery"
2020-0085,2,design/methodology/approach: this study examines 909 lending decisions by 303 finance students on a mock p2p site
2020-0085,3,each participant was asked to make three lending decisions
2020-0085,4,the loan applications were identical with the exception of a female or male photo (vs an icon) and reports of having raised half the loan in either 2 or 11 days (vs 7)
2020-0085,5,findings: investors who have experienced financial trauma are more likely to herd and lend higher amounts to loan applicants that are highly trusted by other lenders
2020-0085,6,this effect is more pronounced for male investors lending to highly trusted female loan applicants
2020-0085,7,practical implications: blockchain can compensate for behavioral biases and improve monitoring by helping track digital money transactions and assisting in bad loan recovery efforts
2020-0085,8,originality/value: this study is the first behavioral experiment to examine herding in p2p lending
2020-0085,9,"the findings complement and corroborate those by gonzalez and komarova (2014, 2015) and emphasize the need for blockchain to assist beyond trusted records and safe transfers of funds"
2020-0198,0,"in this paper, the author aims to show how new technologies, digitalization of everything and green economy approach change the business environment perspective and strategy and organization of business approach"
2020-0198,1,"digitalization, digital transformation, and green economy have become the most commonly used words in the last decade, but especially in recent years"
2020-0198,2,"if a business wants to remain competitive on the market, delivering green products and services at the same time, they must change their management approach"
2020-0198,3,"the research found out that the main impediments in digital and green implementation came from the lack of knowledge and understanding of the process, wrong organizational design and culture"
2020-0198,4,the present paper comes to presents a possible business model to meet the current market requirements
2020-0197,0,purpose: the promotion of financial inclusion can disturb the composition of traditional bank concentration and change the relationship between bank concentration and the availability of small and medium-sized enterprise (sme) financing
2020-0197,1,"this paper concentrates on a less frequently explored area of research by examining the relationships between bank concentration, financial inclusion and sme financing availability respectively, and the interaction between bank concentration and financial inclusion after the implementation of a financial inclusion strategy in china"
2020-0197,2,"design/methodology/approach: using firm-level data from 1,509 listed smes in china from 2007 to 2017 and applying rigorous analyses, we identify how bank concentration affects sme financing availability under the promotion of financial inclusion and also the mechanisms involved"
2020-0197,3,"findings: we find that bank concentration and financial inclusion respectively have positive impacts on the credit available to listed smes, indicating that the promotion of financial inclusion in china has reached a new high watermark"
2020-0197,4,the positive impact of bank concentration is reduced when the level of financial inclusion is high
2020-0197,5,"conversely, a higher level of financial inclusion favours sme credit availability at only a low degree of bank concentration"
2020-0197,6,our findings suggest that financial inclusion has a substitution effect on bank concentration and has enabled us to add new interpretations to relevant theories
2020-0197,7,"namely, the market power and information theories respectively"
2020-0197,8,originality/value: this study provides new insights into the relationship between bank concentration and sme finance availability under the promotion of financial inclusion
2020-0076,0,"given the rapid emergence of fintechs, the objective of this paper is to determine location-specific factors associated with fintech establishment intensity using porters diamond framework"
2020-0076,1,the analysis is based on a country-level dataset covering the period of 20072017 and 107 countries
2020-0076,2,"the results reveal that greater fintech establishment intensity characterizes smaller countries, countries with stronger information and communications technology (ict) services clusters, and countries that have experienced a crisis during the recent decade"
2020-0076,3,"greater fintech establishment intensity is also observed in countries with greater tertiary education enrolment rates, stronger university-industry cooperation, greater fixed line availability, and overall ict readiness"
2020-0076,4,the macroeconomic situation and indicators of financial development prove to be important determinants of fintech formation
2020-0076,5,"given the importance of several dimensions of locations diamond in fintech formation, fintech entrepreneurs could benefit from a careful analysis of the diamond of locations that they are considering as potential places of doing business"
2020-0076,6,"countries hoping to become more attractive fintech establishment sites, in turn, should focus on the elimination of weaknesses in the locations diamond in close co-operation with fintechs"

2020-0355,1,handling of physical cash has been established as a means of transmitting the novel corona virus
2020-0355,2,"again, research has established that, been unbanked raises the potential of sinking one into abject poverty"
2020-0355,3,"over the years, developing countries have been piloting the various forms of fintech, but the very one that has come to stay is the mobile money transactions (mmt)"
2020-0355,4,"as mobile money transactions attempt to gain a foothold, it faces several problems, the most important of them is mobile money fraud"
2020-0355,5,"this paper seeks to provide a solution to this problem by looking at machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (kernel-based), gradient boosted decision tree (tree-based) and naive bayes (probabilistic based) algorithms, taking into consideration the imbalanced nature of the dataset"
2020-0355,6,our experiments showed that the use of gradient boosted decision tree holds a great potential in combating the problem of mobile money fraud as it was able to produce near perfect results
2020-0078,0,we study the effect of a financial education intervention on the propensity to delegate financial decision-making to a digital asset management tool (robo-advisor)
2020-0078,1,our results suggest that investors are more inclined to delegate financial decision-making when they receive detailed information on the investment principles underlying the robo-advisory algorithm
2020-0078,2,"the intervention also affects investors independent investment behavior as it increases diversification and revealed risk aversion, while it decreases self-reported risk aversion"
2020-0078,3,our findings imply that robo-advisors benefit from providing financial education to prospective investors and that financial education may indirectly affect investment outcomes by encouraging the use of financial advice
2020-0356,0,purpose: this paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies
2020-0356,1,design/methodology/approach: this briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context
2020-0356,2,findings: african fintech companies looking to expand across the continent must consider the high levels of heterogeneity that exist within individual markets

2020-0056,0,purpose: this paper aims to examine the determinants that influence bank users acceptance for islamic financial technology (fintech) services by extending the technology acceptance model (tam) in the malaysian context
2020-0056,1,design/methodology/approach: the survey was conducted using convenience sampling
2020-0056,2,"moreover, 205 responses were gathered from users of the islamic bank"
2020-0056,3,"on the same note, the literature on determinants of islamic fintech acceptance and tam was reviewed as well in a bid to contribute to the factors that are instrumental in determining the acceptance of fintech services"
2020-0056,4,"findings: findings of the study reveal that islamic fintechs services acceptance is determined by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and also by another variable, which is consumer innovativeness (ci)"
2020-0056,5,"on the contrary other factors, self-efficacy and subjective norms are found not to be influential in determining islamic fintechs acceptance by islamic banking users"
2020-0056,6,originality/value: tam is extended in the context of islamic fintech

2020-0358,1,"it is a qr code-based mobile secure payment service that the government, seoul metropolitan government (smg), bank, and private settlement providers cooperate to reduce small business owners commission burden"
2020-0358,2,"when a consumer recognizes a qr code as a smartphone app, the fees charged by the merchants franchisee will either be lost or significantly lowered as money transfers from the consumer account to the merchant account"
2020-0358,3,"smg started to ease commissions burden on small businesses suffering from recession, rising rents, and card fees"
2020-0358,4,"however, because of this service started with government policy, zeropay started with many controversies, and these issues need to be addressed for the service to settle down stably"
2020-0358,5,the main discussion of this paper is that this service will be applied successfully to the market
2020-0358,6,the author discusses how the smg efforts settle successfully with strategically initiated services
2020-0359,0,the history of technological development and its progress is through successive waves that overlap
2020-0359,1,"each revolution has its life cycle, its techno-economic paradigm with its structural components of invention, innovation and diffusion"

2020-0359,3,"especially, the new architecture of financial services, which is emerging"
2020-0359,4,the fintech 3.0 era is related to the finance value chain and impacts its business models
2020-0359,5,new digital technologies are changing agriculture in many dimensions beyond financial services (agtech)
2020-0359,6,"in this scenario, this article aims to understand the three simultaneous challenges, enabled by digital and mobile technologies, which impact the links in the value chains, their actual and financial functioning, and the design of products in the agri-food sector"
2020-0359,7,there is good reason to believe that emerging digital technologies can improve the functioning of agricultural markets at a very low cost per farmer
2020-0359,8,"digital agricultural services can improve agricultural productivity, the functioning of agricultural supply chains, traceability, connection between producers and the end customer in the face of climate change and environmental stress"

2020-0108,0,we unite investment by speculators and tech-savvy investors with a heterogeneous agent model
2020-0108,1,"while speculators seek to profit from extrapolating the price trends, tech-savvy investors trade based on the prospective value of bitcoin, which is a function of factors that capture the market demand and technical supply of bitcoin"
2020-0108,2,"estimating the structural model, we find the coexistence of speculators and tech-savvy investors in the bitcoin market"
2020-0108,3,"we further show that, regardless of the market states, tech-savvy investors consistently buy (sell) bitcoin when its price goes below (above) the prospective value"
2020-0108,4,"however, speculators follow a momentum trading strategy in the high-market-volatility regime and switch to a contrarian strategy in the low-market-volatility regime"
2020-0108,5,our finding suggests that a significant fraction of tech-savvy investors value the potential of bitcoin as an innovative technology
2020-0108,6,incorporating heterogeneous investors yields better in-sample estimation efficiency and out-of-sample forecasting precision than models that consider only speculators or tech-savvy investors
2020-0103,0,"the development of the blockchain with its different virtues (decentralized trust, auditability, accessibility, immutability of their operations, etc.) has allowed centralized applications to find a solution to their problems, such as trust, scalability, etc"
2020-0103,1,one of these applications is the electronic signature of contracts which is a key point for the deployment of electronic transactions in the field of e-commerce
2020-0103,2,"we have used the blockchain for contract-signing to avoid the use of centralized trusted third-parties, in a simple way, and where the use of any blockchain solution, allowing data to be published at a reasonable cost, can be easily integrated in our proposal, involving bitcoin-based solutions (e.g., litecoin or dash) or ethereum"

2020-0360,1,borrowers who promise to repay the loan
2020-0360,2,"loan pricing has attracted intense scrutiny of the industry from both advocates and critics alike, as these loans have a short term (next payday) to maturity and the cost of borrowing, expressed as an annual percentage rate, is nearly 400%"
2020-0360,3,"however, due to a new industry regulatory environment emerging at the federal level, a myriad of innovative financial (fintech) opportunities emanating from traditional banking and credit unions will be available to the underserved population"
2020-0360,4,"furthermore, increased product and price competition will likely reduce the predatory non-traditional lending presence in the industry"

2020-0189,2,"using nearly complete loan and application data from the online lending market, we demonstrate that bank misconduct is associated with a statistically and economically significant increase in online lending demand at the state and county levels"
2020-0189,3,this result is robust to the inclusion of bank credit supply shocks and holds for both broader and more narrowly-defined bank misconduct measures
2020-0189,4,"furthermore, we show that this effect is strongest for lower rated borrowers and weakest in states with high levels of generalized trust"
2020-0237,0,the market for derivatives is substantially different after the 2007/08 financial crisis
2020-0237,1,trust fuels business yet the financial crisis undermined this concept and customers lost faith in financial institutions
2020-0237,2,"the then dichotomy, faced by innovators, was to insist with a system based on trust in financial institutions, or explore others where neither trust nor banks, as intermediaries, were indispensable for the successful and safe completion of financial transactions"
2020-0237,3,the aim of this piece of research is to analyse to what extent innovative technology would change the way the 'over the counter' (otc) market operates by providing investors with a trustworthy platform for the efficient assessment of the risk behind certain financial instruments
2020-0237,4,"consequently, the market may not be caught by surprise when another financial crisis strikes"
2020-0079,0,this paper studies simple moving average trading strategies employing daily price data on the ten most-traded cryptocurrencies that exhibit the privacy function
2020-0079,1,"investigating the 20162018 period, our results indicate a variable moving average strategy is successful only when applied to dash generating returns of 14.6%18.25% p.a"
2020-0079,2,in excess of the simple buy-and-hold benchmark strategy
2020-0079,3,"however, when applying our technical trading rules to the entire set of ten privacy coins shows that, on an aggregate level, simple technical trading rules do not generate positive returns in excess of a buy-and-hold strategy"
2020-0055,0,"big tech's unregulated roll-out out of experimental ai poses risks to the achievement of the un sustainable development goals (sdgs), with particular vulnerability for developing countries"
2020-0055,1,the goal of financial inclusion is threatened by the imperfect and ungoverned design and implementation of ai decision-making software making important financial decisions affecting customers
2020-0055,2,"automated decision-making algorithms have displayed evidence of bias, lack ethical governance, and limit transparency in the basis for their decisions, causing unfair outcomes and amplify unequal access to finance"
2020-0055,3,poverty reduction and sustainable development targets are risked by big tech's potential exploitation of developing countries by using ai to harvest data and profits
2020-0055,4,stakeholder progress toward preventing financial crime and corruption is further threatened by potential misuse of ai
2020-0055,5,"in the light of such risks, big tech's unscrupulous history means it cannot be trusted to operate without regulatory oversight"
2020-0055,6,the article proposes effective pre-emptive regulatory options to minimize scenarios of ai damaging the sdgs
2020-0055,7,"it explores internationally accepted principles of ai governance, and argues for their implementation as regulatory requirements governing ai developers and coders, with compliance verified through algorithmic auditing"
2020-0055,8,"furthermore, it argues that ai governance frameworks must require a benefit to the sdgs"
2020-0055,9,the article argues that proactively predicting such problems can enable continued ai innovation through well-designed regulations adhering to international principles
2020-0055,10,"it highlights risks of unregulated ai causing harm to human interests, where a public and regulatory backlash may result in over-regulation that could damage the otherwise beneficial development of ai"
2020-0235,0,regional banks have a competitive advantage in that short distances to clients enable the use of soft information for superior lending decisions
2020-0235,1,"if the ambition of fintech start-ups to create superior screening and monitoring technologies materialises, this advantage would be diminished and regional banks would become superfluous for small firm finance"
2020-0235,2,"to explore this claim, the paper in hand analyses qualitative empirical data about the lending processes and rating system use of regional german savings banks"
2020-0235,3,"in essence, the results from participant observation and interviews clarify the importance of real soft information for critical lending decisions"
2020-0235,4,the context specificity and limited verifiability of real soft information hamper it from being hardened through the use of rating systems and other bank-ict
2020-0235,5,"though fintech's scoring technologies may overcome the first limitation, it appears likely that in the course of scoring development real soft information will be systematically crowded out due to the manipulation problem"
2020-0235,6,"the paper expects improved access to finance for smes if fintech solutions overcome both limitations of real soft information use, or if peer-to-peer lending and regional banks coexist"
2020-0235,7,"deteriorated access to finance is expected if fintech companies displace the relationship banking of regional banks due to enhanced competition, without preserving the advantages of real soft information with superior screening and monitoring technologies"
2020-0235,8,the paper concludes with recommendations on how to prevent deteriorated access to finance for small firms by promoting fair competition and fintech innovations
2020-0003,0,many papers in recent years have examined the benefits of adding alternative assets to traditional portfolios containing stocks and bonds
2020-0003,1,bitcoin has emerged as a new alternative investment for investors which has attracted much attention from the media and investors alike
2020-0003,2,however relatively little is known about the investment benefits of bitcoin and therefore this paper examines the benefit of including bitcoin in a traditional benchmark portfolio of stocks and bonds
2020-0003,3,"specially, we employ data up to june 2018 and analyse the potential out-of-sample portfolio benefits resulting from including bitcoin in a stock-bond portfolio for a range of eight popular asset allocation strategies"
2020-0003,4,"the out-of-sample analysis shows that, across all different asset allocation strategies and risk aversions, the benefits of bitcoin are quite considerable with substantially higher risk-adjusted returns"
2020-0003,5,"our results are robust to rolling estimation windows, the incorporation of transaction costs, the inclusion of a commodity portfolio, alternative indices, short-selling as well as two additional optimization techniques including higher moments with (and without) variance-based constraints (vbcs)"
2020-0003,6,"therefore, our results suggest that investors should include bitcoin in their portfolio as it generates substantial higher risk-adjusted returns"
2020-0131,0,this study aims to examine the impact of the growth of peer-to-peer (p2p) lending on the growth of rural bank lending
2020-0131,1,"further, this study investigates the outcome of the partnership agreement between the rural bank association and financial technology (fintech) association in the last quarter of 2017 on the effect of p2p lending on rural bank lending by analyzing the impact separately in 2018 and 2019"
2020-0131,2,the publicly available data from the financial services authority and bank of indonesia were examined using panel data regression
2020-0131,3,the results show that p2p lendings growth is a substitute for the growth of the rural bank loan in 2018
2020-0131,4,"however, the partnership between the rural bank association and fintech association changed the effect of substitution into complementary in 2019"
2020-0131,5,"moreover, the impact of p2p lending was more prominent in provinces with a higher number of rural banks and regions with lower economic growth"
2020-0131,6,the restricted number of publicly available data becomes the limitation of this study to obtain the best results
2020-0117,0,purpose: online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platforms are becoming increasingly popular globally in recent years
2020-0117,1,"our knowledge of how to develop and manage the digital platforms that make p2p lending possible, however, is limited"
2020-0117,2,"through an in-depth examination of the strategies deployed and actions taken across the various stages of development of tuodao, one of the most successful online p2p lending platforms in china, the purpose of this study is to develop a process model of p2p lending platform development to address this knowledge gap"
2020-0117,3,"design/methodology/approach: the case research method was adopted for this research, and a total of 16 informants were interviewed"
2020-0117,4,"the informants were composed of representatives of tuodaostop management, organizational it functions as well as its various business units"
2020-0117,5,"findings: our study reveals that the development of a p2p lending platform can unfold in a specific sequence across three stages, and the development of a particular side of the platform should be emphasized in each stage (i.e"
2020-0117,6,"partners, followed by lenders, and then borrowers)"
2020-0117,7,"each stage is also distinctive in terms of their strategies and platform configuration outcomes, which are elaborated on in our paper"
2020-0117,8,originality/value: our process model contributes an in-depth view of how p2p lending platforms should be established and nurtured to complement the existing studies in this rapidly growing research area
2020-0117,9,"in addition, our study also hints at the strategies that can facilitate the various stages"
2020-0117,10,"our model can potentially serve as the foundation for formulating guidelines for the managers of p2p lending platforms, so that they are able to optimize the development of their platforms and extend the benefits of p2p lending to a broader base of customers"
2020-0361,0,the advancement of technology a?ects the life of the modern society in many ways

2020-0187,0,the presence of fintech as an innovative and disruptive financial service can improve the efficiency and scope of financial services through the application of technology
2020-0187,1,fintech is considered to have various benefits
2020-0187,2,"however, based on survey conducted by dailysocial and otoritas jasa keuangan finds that the fintech adoption rate in indonesia is still relatively low at around 58.1%, this is in line with a penetration level of fintech in asia which indonesia usage level still in 5% compared to china, hong kong, and india"
2020-0187,3,"in determining fintech adoption, users tend to do rational calculations by comparing the perceived benefits and risks and will decide to adopt them when the perceived benefits are greater than the risks received"
2020-0187,4,"according to some studies, trust can be mediated to reduce some level of risk, thus this study will also include trust variables in the risk-benefit framework to determine user adoption intention on fintech services in indonesia"
2020-0187,5,"based on data collected from 100 fintech users, this study initially investigated whether perceived benefits and risks significantly impacted fintech adoption intention"
2020-0187,6,partial least square (pls-sem) method is used to estimate the relationship between constructs
2020-0187,7,"as a resulting trust, economic benefit and convenience are proven to significantly influence the user to adopt fintech"
2020-0187,8,"while privacy awareness, financial risk, and legal risk are significantly affected by user trust"
2020-0187,9,the hypothesis testing indicates that security risk has the biggest negative effect and convenience has the biggest positive effect on fintech adoption intention

2020-0129,10,findings: the author evaluates the evolution of commercial real estate brokerage
2020-0129,11,"while innovations will, no doubt, have an impact on the ways in which we buy and lease commercial properties, the lessons from the housing market should make us skeptical about the possibility of the new technologies dramatically facilitating disintermediation in this market"
2020-0129,12,"in fact, new oligopolies seem to be emerging with regard to market data provision"
2020-0129,13,"practical implications: proptech will change some aspects of the real estate industry, but not others! originality/value: as change pervades the property industry, only a relatively few research pieces are illustrating ormore importantlyproviding insights about the likely economic and financial impacts of it penetration"
2020-0129,14,"similarly, only a few papers have so far addressed the economic viability of the alternative business models of tech startups targeting real estate markets and transactions"
2020-0156,0,purpose: this paper aims to critically assess digital finance as a pro-poor intervention in the development finance space
2020-0156,1,"design/methodology/approach: using critical policy discourse analysis, this paper explains the turn from microfinance to digital finance, and thereafter discusses four issues: the lack of evidence that digital finance for poor people actually promotes socioeconomic development"
2020-0156,2,"the risks that poor people are exposed to, which arises from their exposure to digital finance technology"
2020-0156,3,the lack of evidence that digital finance actually brings poor people immediate benefits

2020-0233,1,regular updates and a complete financial legal system are needed to implement an effective legal governance
2020-0233,2,"china's fintech development is leading the world, but its lagging legal development does not match its rank in the field"
2020-0233,3,"due to the difficult co-ordination of regulatory goals, unclear allocation of regulatory power, insufficient risk identification, and incomplete regulation tools, china's legal governance on fintech risks has been swinging between the paths of suppressive, indulging, and adaptive regulation"
2020-0233,4,"it is urgently necessary to follow the fintech-risk law and fully tap into the local resources and explore the intervening path with more proactivity, foresight, and refined characteristics, through specification of the legal status and governing power of the intervening entity, the institutional basis and legal effect of interventional means, and the governing key and constitutional rules of intervening objects, to establish a legal-governance system on fintech risks that is innovation-friendly, regulatorily effective, and safe at the bottom line, fully covering the whole process"

2020-0186,1,financial service providers (fsps) offering financially-inclusive solutions need to understand how to approach the underserved successfully
2020-0186,2,the application of artificial intelligence (ai) on legacy data can help fsps to anticipate how prospective customers may respond when they are approached
2020-0186,3,"however, it remains challenging for fsps who are not well-versed in computer programming to implement ai projects"
2020-0186,4,"this paper proffers a no-coding human-centric ai-based approach to simulate the possible dynamics between the financial profiles of prospective customers collected from 45,211 contact encounters and predict their intentions toward the financial products being offered"
2020-0186,5,this approach contributes to the literature by illustrating how ai for social good can also be accessible for people who are not well-versed in computer science
2020-0186,6,a rudimentary ai-based predictive modeling approach that does not require programming skills will be illustrated in this paper
2020-0186,7,"in these ai-generated multi-criteria optimizations, analysts in fsps can simulate scenarios to better understand their prospective customers"
2020-0186,8,"in conjunction with the usage of ai, this paper also suggests how ai-thinking could be utilized as a cognitive scaffold for educing (drawing out) actionable insights to advance financial inclusion"

2020-0100,1,blockchain technology has attracted wide interest from various stakeholders
2020-0100,2,"many theorists are predicting that this technology will disrupt financial services, including insurance"
2020-0100,3,"as stated that the development of blockchain is dependent on regulatory acceptance of this technology, it is essential to establish the current state of play with regard to the application and use of blockchain from a commercial and regulatory standpoints"
2020-0100,4,design/methodology/approach: this review encompasses a number of approaches to view the current status of blockchain applications
2020-0100,5,"from a commercial approach, this research lists the current applications of blockchain within the insurance industry"
2020-0100,6,"from a regulatory point of view, the current positions of the eu and national regulatory bodies are enquired upon to establish how they are examining fintech and blockchain technologies within their regulatory processes"
2020-0100,7,findings: this review illustrates a number of blockchain applications in situ from a commercial point of view
2020-0100,8,"from a regulatory setting and following a call from international and eu levels, it appears that various regulatory bodies have begun the process of formulating testing processes for fintech applications"
2020-0100,9,"there are two predominant types in operation, while others are forming points of contact for advice for fintechs and a small amount who have not begun the process at all"
2020-0100,10,research limitations/implications: this review illustrates the current state of play of blockchain in insurance from a commercial and regulatory point of view
2020-0100,11,"while this has been observational, this review pulls together information from various sources to encapsulate the regulatory positioning of evaluating fintech and blockchain technologies for academia, regulatory and industry audiences"
2020-0100,12,originality/value: this review offers a central resource of information with regard to the current state of blockchain technologies in operation and regulatory approaches to this and other fintech developments
2020-0012,0,"germany is falling behind its peers in adopting new digital technologies and financial services offered by non-bank high-tech startups (e.g., fintech)"
2020-0012,1,"using survey data, we analyze which fintech services households are likely to adopt"
2020-0012,2,"our results indicate that a household's level of trust and comfort with new technologies, financial literacy, and overall transparency impact its propensity to switch to a fintech"
2020-0012,3,"specifically, households with low levels of trust, good financial education, and preference for transparency are characterized by a higher probability of adopting fintech"
2020-0012,4,"in contrast, household price perceptions do not appear to significantly impact switching probability"
2020-0133,0,judgments are taken in a structured way
2020-0133,1,"both human and business management decisions involve a hierarchical process that requires a level of compromise between risk, cost, reward, experience and knowledge"
2020-0133,2,this article proposes a management decision structure that emulates the human brain approach based on genetic and deep learning cluster algorithms and the random neural network
2020-0133,3,"reinforcement learning takes quick and specific local decisions, deep learning clusters enables identity and memory, and deep learning management clusters make final strategic decisions"
2020-0133,4,the presented genetic algorithm transmits the learned information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons
2020-0133,5,"because the subjects information, a combination of memory, identity and decision data, is never lost but transmitted, the genetic algorithm provides immortality"
2020-0133,6,the management decision structure has been applied and validated in a smart investment fintech application: an intelligent banker that makes buy and sell asset decisions with an associated market and risk that entirely transmits itself to a future generation
2020-0133,7,results are rewarding
2020-0133,8,"the management decision structure with genetics and machine learning based on the random neural network algorithm that emulates the human brain and biology transmits information to future generations and learns autonomously, gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment"
2020-0371,0,"the present work investigates the impact on financial intermediation of distributed ledger technology (dlt), which is usually associated with the blockchain technology and is at the base of the cryptocurrencies' development"
2020-0371,1,bitcoin is the expression of its main application since it was the first new currency that gained popularity some years after its release date and it is still the major cryptocurrency in the market
2020-0371,2,"for this reason, the present analysis is focused on studying its price determination, which seems to be still almost unpredictable"
2020-0371,3,"we carry out an empirical analysis based on a cost of production model, trying to detect whether the bitcoin price could be justified by and connected to the profits and costs associated with the mining effort"
2020-0371,4,"we construct a sample model, composed of the hardware devices employed in the mining process"
2020-0371,5,"after collecting the technical information required and computing a cost and a profit function for each period, an implied price for the bitcoin value is derived"
2020-0371,6,"the interconnection between this price and the historical one is analyzed, adopting a vector autoregression (var) model"
2020-0371,7,our main results put on evidence that there aren't ultimate drivers for bitcoin price
2020-0371,8,"probably many factors should be expressed and studied at the same time, taking into account their variability and different relevance over time"
2020-0371,9,"it seems that the historical price fluctuated around the model (or implied) price until 2017, when the bitcoin price significantly increased"
2020-0371,10,"during the last months of 2018, the prices seem to converge again, following a common path"
2020-0371,11,"in detail, we focus on the time window in which bitcoin experienced its higher price volatility"
2020-0371,12,the results suggest that it is disconnected from the one predicted by the model
2020-0371,13,"these findings may depend on the particular features of the new cryptocurrencies, which have not been completely understood yet"
2020-0371,14,"in our opinion, there is not enough knowledge on cryptocurrencies to assert that bitcoin price is (or is not) based on the profit and cost derived by the mining process, but these intrinsic characteristics must be considered, including other possible bitcoin price drivers"

2020-0194,3,in order to detect current approach to big data analysis in public and private sectors authors conduct interviews with stakeholders
2020-0194,4,the paper concludes with the analysis what changes in approaches to the big data analysis in public and private sectors have to be made in order to comply with the global trends in greening the economy
2020-0194,5,"application of fintech, methods of processing large data sets and tools for implementing the principles of greening the economy will enable to increase the investment attractiveness of green business and will simplify the interaction between the state and enterprises"
2020-0225,0,the modern world is changing rapidly under the influence of digital technologies
2020-0225,1,this also applies to the financial sector of the economy
2020-0225,2,"since the mid-2000s, new fintech companies have entered the market"
2020-0225,3,these companies are using new technologies to improve existing and create new financial services
2020-0225,4,"in the course of their development, the interests of new market entrants often overlap with those of traditional participants, mainly banks"
2020-0225,5,investigation of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future
2020-0225,6,the research of the relations between fintech companies and traditional financial institutions gives an opportunity to form an idea of the financial picture of the near future
2020-0225,7,the article considers both aspects of competition and aspects of possible cooperation between financial market participants in a digital economy
2020-0225,8,the results of the scientific research demonstrate that cooperation will prevail over the competition
2020-0225,9,probably existing financial institutions will reformat their architecture and become digital ones at the core
2020-0024,0,purpose: the purpose of this paper is to delineate a research agenda to guide future service research investigating the digital transformation of financial service systems through fintech  disruptive innovations by new market entrants that challenge the position of mainstream financial institutions
2020-0024,1,"design/methodology/approach: rooted in the philosophical foundations of use-inspired research, this paper addresses the managerially and societally relevant phenomenon of fintech by identifying, and responding to, the individual challenges and problems associated with the digital transformation of financial services"
2020-0024,2,"this is accomplished through a computational text-mining approach to analyze the corpus of 1,545 published practitioner articles associated with fintech, identification of managerial challenges therein and subsequent delineation of a novel research agenda"
2020-0024,3,"findings: by connecting managerial challenges relating to fintech with the service literature, this paper develops a use-inspired research agenda that provides scholarly and managerially relevant research directions (rds)"
2020-0024,4,"these pertain to the complexity of digital financial service systems (micro level), orchestration of value co-creation with fintech (meso level), and the development of elastic infrastructures, models and markets (macro level)"
2020-0024,5,research limitations/implications: fintech is an emerging phenomenon associated with the digital transformation of financial services
2020-0024,6,"however, actual guidelines on how service research related to fintech could be advanced from a theoretically as well as managerially relevant angle are unavailable to date"
2020-0024,7,"here, the authors address this challenge and provide the field with 18 tangible rds to advance service theory and practice"
2020-0024,8,practical implications: the purpose of this paper is to guide future academic research addressing managerial challenges associated with fintech and the digital transformation of financial service
2020-0024,9,"due to the explicit use-inspired nature of the work, the future research stemming from the agenda that the authors put forward here will be of benefit to decision makers and society more broadly"

2020-0109,0,"serverless computing is steadily becoming the implementation paradigm of choice for a variety of applications, from data analytics to web applications, as it addresses the main problems with serverfull and monolithic architecture"
2020-0109,1,"in particular, it abstracts away resource provisioning and infrastructure management, enabling developers to focus on the logic of the program instead of worrying about resource management which will be handled by cloud providers"
2020-0109,2,"in this paper, we consider a document processing system used in fintech as a case study and describe the migration journey from a monolithic architecture to a serverless architecture"
2020-0109,3,our evaluation results show that the serverless implementation significantly improves performance while resulting in only a marginal increase in cost
2020-0028,0,china's financial system is rapidly evolving
2020-0028,1,"both the emergence of shadow banking since 2009 and the growth of fintech since 2013 as forms of non-bank credit intermediation have catalysed market-oriented institutional change beyond the banking system, with potentially far-reaching economic and political implications"
2020-0028,2,in this article we assess these developments in the broader trajectory of china's financial reform and economic development
2020-0028,3,through an analysis of two key sectors of non-bank credit intermediationwealth management products and online lending platformswe find that the growth of both shadow banking and fintech can be located in the same trajectory of reform and development that has animated chinese financial policy since the early 1990s
2020-0028,4,the toleration of wmps and promotion of internet lending constitutes the latest stage of the chinese communist party's efforts to construct a more efficient and sustainable market economy whilst simultaneously preserving political supremacy and custodianship of macro-social development
2020-0028,5,the difference in policy response is commensurate with the degree to which each financial sector meets the party's twin objectives of economic development and political control
2020-0028,6,"counterintuitively from a western liberal perspective, the very forces behind deep and broad financial liberalisation are also consolidating the chinese communist party's overall legitimacy and ruling capacity"
2020-0248,0,"the responsibility of the government is to protect all activities of its citizens, including activities about technology that are growing so fast, one of the problems is the increasing public interest in peer to peer online financial technology which encourages the enhancement of financial inclusion in indonesia"
2020-0248,1,this study analyse government regulations on financial services authority regulation no
2020-0248,2,"77/pojk.01/2016 concerning information technology-based lending and borrowing services, even though it has been regulated about lending and borrowing services, the government does not seem ready enough to faceagainst regulatory issues related to criminal acts related to the protection of personal data"
2020-0248,3,"basically, the problems that arise require the consequences of inter-agency or ministerial relations, for example in the ministry of communication and information (kemkominfo) with financial service authority institutions"
2020-0248,4,"through the method of statute approach, qualitatively, this study shows that the government needs to use the regulations of lexspecialis to protect customer data that is often misused by many loan service companies through online technology"
2020-0374,0,financial technology (fintech) is revolutionising the banking and finance sector at an inimitable pace
2020-0374,1,the concept of market and consumer has shifted dramatically to a new level as technology emerged in financial services industry
2020-0374,2,"however, such service is not familiar among the marginalised people as it involves technology and cost"
2020-0374,3,scheduled tribes in india have been viewed as the most distraught social group subject to age-old financial and social hardships
2020-0374,4,financial literacy on financial services has been shown to be a crucial factor in making effective decisions and choices regarding finance
2020-0374,5,this paper tries to examine both overall and category wise financial literacy of scheduled tribes in kerala with special emphasis on gender
2020-0374,6,it uses primary data of 393 tribal respondents from seven tribal communities across the most three tribally populated districts
2020-0374,7,"it observed that, there are disarrays in the use of fintech services among tribes"
2020-0374,8,the tribal community has not been able to find satisfactory literacy in fintech services
2020-0374,9,"but they have a healthy knowledge on other basic financial and banking services, and women often outperform men in this regard"
2020-0375,0,the expansion of information communication technology (ict) significantly influences organizations service delivering culture
2020-0375,1,"the financial institutions, particularly the banking industry are one of the major sectors that invests large amount of capital for introducing new technologies"
2020-0375,2,e-finance is one of the technology channels that bankers introduced to their customers to access financial services
2020-0375,3,"therefore, this study was aimed to study the effect of e-finance service quality on bank customers' fintech loyalty of using the e-finance services in future"
2020-0375,4,primary data was collected from 412 bank customers and it was analyzed using the structural equation model (sem) through amos

2020-0082,0,cryptocurrencies represented by bitcoin have fully demonstrated their advantages and great potential in payment and monetary systems during the last decade
2020-0082,1,"the mining pool, which is considered the source of bitcoin, is the cornerstone of market stability"
2020-0082,2,the surveillance of the mining pool can help regulators effectively assess the overall health of bitcoin and issues
2020-0082,3,"however, the anonymity of mining-pool miners and the difficulty of analyzing large numbers of transactions limit in-depth analysis"
2020-0082,4,it is also a challenge to achieve intuitive and comprehensive monitoring of multi-source heterogeneous data
2020-0082,5,"in this study, we present supoolvisor, an interactive visual analytics system that supports surveillance of the mining pool and de-anonymization by visual reasoning"
2020-0082,6,supoolvisor is divided into pool level and address level
2020-0082,7,"at the pool level, we use a sorted stream graph to illustrate the evolution of computing power of pools over time, and glyphs are designed in two other views to demonstrate the influence scope of the mining pool and the migration of pool members"
2020-0082,8,"at the address level, we use a force-directed graph and a massive sequence view to present the dynamic address network in the mining pool"
2020-0082,9,"particularly, these two views, together with the radviz view, support an iterative visual reasoning process for de-anonymization of pool members and provide interactions for cross-view analysis and identity marking"
2020-0082,10,"effectiveness and usability of supoolvisor are demonstrated using three cases, in which we cooperate closely with experts in this field"
2020-0019,0,the recent fast development of machine learning provides new tools to solve challenges in many areas
2020-0019,1,"in finance, average options are popular financial products among corporations, institutional investors, and individual investors for risk management and investment because average options have the advantages of cheap prices and their payoffs are not very sensitive to the changes of the underlying asset prices at the maturity date, avoiding the manipulation of asset prices and option prices"
2020-0019,2,the challenge is that pricing arithmetic average options requires traditional numerical methods with the drawbacks of expensive repetitive computations and non-realistic model assumptions
2020-0019,3,this paper proposes a machine-learning method to price arithmetic and geometric average options accurately and in particular quickly
2020-0019,4,the method is model-free and it is verified by empirical applications as well as numerical experiments
2020-0247,0,the enormous rise of financial technology companies has greatly challenged traditional financial institutions
2020-0247,1,"one emerging innovation is social trading (st), which combines the advantages of social networks and delegated trading"
2020-0247,2,"st platforms represent a unique context of social media platforms, on which the impact of social influence on the potential customers intention to use is not well understood"
2020-0247,3,"moreover, researchers and practitioners lack an understanding of the moderating role of the consumers previous experience regarding security trading"
2020-0247,4,"as research in the field of st is rather young, our study aims to be the first to address these research gaps by developing and empirically validating a model from the potential customers perspective"
2020-0247,5,we based our framework on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and theory regarding social media and financial decision-making
2020-0247,6,"our results illustrate that performance-related aspects are the dominant determinants of behavioral intention for experienced users, whereas system-related and personal barriers affect behavioral intentions of the inexperienced group"
2020-0247,7,"consequently, differences regarding performance expectancy, effort expectancy, security and risk aversion were identified"
2020-0247,8,our results indicate that current platform operators advertising approaches of communicating the simple functionality of the platform seem inappropriate to meet the consumers needs
2020-0249,0,"fintech, as they call companies that use the latest developments in the field of mobile payments, online lending, digital instant money transfers and other breakthrough technologies in building their business models"
2020-0249,1,organizations built on such models today are at the forefront of the latest technologies

2020-0249,4,"during the writing of this thesis the theoretical methods, a comparison and a statistical methods were used"
2020-0249,5,"the periodicals of modern literature, magazines and internet resources were used in this work"
2020-0249,6,the theoretical and practical significance of the work consists in a broader disclosure of the conceptual apparatus and the possibility of using the results obtained in the course of the research in the activities of various institutions to develop measures to improve their activities
2020-0042,0,"a growing body of evidence suggests that financial literacy plays an important role in financial well-being, and that differences in financial knowledge acquired early in life can explain a significant part of financial and more general well-being in adult life"
2020-0042,1,financial technology (fintech) is revolutionising the financial services industry at an unrivalled pace
2020-0042,2,"views differ regarding the likely impact that fintech is likely to have on personal financial planning, well-being and societal welfare"
2020-0042,3,"in an era of mounting student debt, increased (digital) financial inclusion, and threats arising from instances of (online) financial fraud, financial education and enlightened financial advising appropriate policy interventions that enhance financial and overall well-being"
2020-0042,4,this special issue engages in this important academic and policy agenda by presenting a set of seven new papers emanating from four parallel streams of literature related to financial literacy and responsible finance
2020-0134,0,this article examines fintech as a systemic force disrupting the currently dominant technocratic paradigm of financial regulation
2020-0134,1,"it offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the key fintech-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and (ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of the regulatory enterprise as it exists today"
2020-0134,2,this exercise reveals the fundamental tension at the core of the fintech problem
2020-0134,3,"in the fintech era, the financial system as a whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and difficult to manage"
2020-0134,4,"the emerging regulatory responses to these macro-level changes, however, continue to operate primarily on the micro-level"
2020-0134,5,"surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate fintech, this article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design"
2020-0134,6,"against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of the fintech challenge- a nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively unified manner"
2020-0106,0,the digitalization of financial services opened a window for new players in the financial industry
2020-0106,1,"these start-ups take on tasks and functions previously reserved for banks, such as financing, asset management, and payments"
2020-0106,2,"in this article, we trace the transformation of the industry after digitalization"
2020-0106,3,"by using data on fintech formations in germany, we provide first evidence that entrepreneurial dynamics in the fintech sector are not so much driven by technology as by the educational and business background of the founders"
2020-0106,4,"furthermore, we investigate the reactions of traditional banks to the emergence of these start-ups"
2020-0106,5,"in contrast with other emerging industries such as biotechnology, a network analysis shows that fintechs have mostly engaged in strategic partnerships and only a few banks have acquired or obtained a financial interest in a fintech"
2020-0106,6,we explain the restraint of traditional banks to fully endorse the new possibilities of digitalized financial services with the characteristics of the technology itself and with the postponed fundamental decisions of banks to modernize their it infrastructure
2020-0195,0,"in this paper, we propose a goal-based investment model that is suitable for personalized wealth management"
2020-0195,1,"the model only requires a few intuitive inputs such as size of wealth, investment amount, and consumption goals from individual investors"
2020-0195,2,"in particular, a priority level can be assigned to each consumption goal and the model provides a holistic solution based on a sequential approach starting with the highest priority"
2020-0195,3,this allows strict prioritization by maximizing the probability of achieving higher priority goals that are not affected by goals with lower priorities
2020-0195,4,"furthermore, the proposed model is formulated as a linear program that efficiently finds the optimal financial plan"
2020-0195,5,"with its simplicity, flexibility, and computational efficiency, the proposed goal-based investment model provides a new framework for automated investment management services"
2020-0250,0,the supply chain is a complex framework of facilities working together to gain profits
2020-0250,1,rapid changes in technology have made the commerce a place of high competition and hugely affected by price fluctuation
2020-0250,2,bitcom is a proposed architecture bolstered by the emerging concept of blockchain
2020-0250,3,it aims to provide a clean and efficient supply chain to decrease system-wide costs
2020-0250,4,it is a framework deriving its roots form both-permissioned and permissionless blockchains to achieve a feasible solution to the problem of automating commerce

2020-0250,6,it uses flexible smart contracts for negotiations and transactions while permissionless entry is provided to the users
2020-0250,7,the concept of a credibility score has been introduced to help introduce trust in a decentralised network
2020-0273,0,"online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, once a marketplace teeming with retail investors, is now dominated by sophisticated institutional investors and banks"
2020-0273,1,this seismic shift in investor base has been coupled with significant growth for the legacy p2p lenders and new entrants
2020-0273,2,"a new regulatory approach is needed to grapple with these changes-one that focuses on consumer protection, as opposed to one that seeks to protect the sophisticated investors purchasing these loans"
2020-0273,3,"fortunately, such an approach is readily available in the office of the comptroller of the currency's fintech charter"
2020-0273,4,"this comment surveys the significant changes that have occurred in the p2p lending sector over the past ten years, as well as the risks and benefits to consumers attendant to the rapid growth in this relatively new form of lending"
2020-0273,5,"after surveying the current and proposed regulatory approaches toward p2p lending, this comment explains why a national fintech charter is the best approach to ensuring that consumers who rely on these loans receive the full protections guaranteed by federal law"
2020-0376,0,"similar to the internet, which created a revolution in the ability to communicate quickly and cheaply, fintech companies are using blockchain and digital wallets to create a revolution in the transfer of value across the world"
2020-0376,1,the literature and blog space to date have indicated that digital wallets could overtake the need for traditional banking
2020-0376,2,the purpose of this article is to provide further testing on whether fintech banking companies could overtake the need for traditional banking by evaluating whether the number of deposits at various us commercial banks and the growth of digital wallets have impacted us commercial bank market values over the past two to three years
2020-0376,3,results indicate a strong positive relationship between the number of deposits and us commercial bank market values and a strong negative relationship between digital wallet proxy measures and us commercial bank market values from 2017 to 2019
2020-0376,4,the trends indicate a stable amount of deposit in the us banking system to a slight decline versus a large growth in the digital wallet sphere
2020-0376,5,results indicate that digital wallets could create a large decrease in the market value of commercial banks in the future
2020-0376,6,such a result would indicate the need to consider carefully how fintech companies should be included in financial sector indices
2020-0136,0,"recent years have witnessed unprecedented growth in mobile payments, digital wallet being the latest trend"
2020-0136,1,these payments are very popular among young people in countries like china and india

2020-0127,3,bahrain is considered as the hub of islamic banking in the gcc and all over the world
2020-0127,4,bahrain has the largest concentration of islamic banks in the world
2020-0127,5,the main objective of this study is to find the impact of agility and fintech on the future of islamic banking in bahrain
2020-0127,6,the research has used mainly secondary data for its study
2020-0127,7,the study concludes that the fintech has potential impact on the future of islamic banking
2020-0127,8,there was a reluctant on the part of islamic banks to adopt fintech
2020-0127,9,they treated fintech as more of a competitor than the partners
2020-0127,10,"the islamic banks now must understand to be agile, competitive and aggressive"
2020-0127,11,the study indicated many points which highlights the necessity on the part of islamic banks to be agile and adopt fintech as partners
2020-0378,0,fintech has been a pivotal force behind most of the transition taking place in the financial arena in india and worldwide in last few years
2020-0378,1,it is potentially one of the game changing disruptive forces which have transformed the financial ecosystem leveraging the throughput of banking and financial services
2020-0378,2,"the advent of financial technology has given much needed impetus to the otherwise struggling financial institutions, which have been able to cut down a lot on redundant costs"
2020-0378,3,"resultantly, the institutions have been able to maximise operating efficiency and reduce costs to a large extent"
2020-0378,4,the technology backed financial landscape has been improved over a period of time with results being evident in its profitability and other allied ratios
2020-0378,5,this research paper discusses a probable role which financial technology has played in the profitability of the financial institutions specifically banks in indian context
2020-0006,0,"we argue financial technology (fintech) is the key driver for financial inclusion, which in turn underlies sustainable balanced development, as embodied in the un sustainable development goals (sdgs)"
2020-0006,1,the full potential of fintech to support the sdgs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation
2020-0006,2,our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars
2020-0006,3,"the first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-kyc systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems"
2020-0006,4,the third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments
2020-0006,5,the fourth pillardesign of digital financial markets and systemssupports broader access to finance and investment
2020-0006,6,"implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through fintech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development"
2020-0043,0,this study aims to assess why users are willing/hesitant to continue using fintech services based on their perceived benefits and risks pertaining to the use of fintech technology
2020-0043,1,"data was collected, using an adopted survey instrument, from bankers based in bahrain, the financial and fintech hub of the middle east"
2020-0043,2,data analysis was applied to assess the reliability and validity of this study's conceptual model along with its nine hypotheses with 374 valid responses subsequently being analysed using multiple regression via spss version 23
2020-0043,3,"the empirical findings of this study supported all the hypotheses, revealing that both perceived benefit and risks affect the intent to continue using fintech"
2020-0043,4,"perceived benefit has a stronger effect than the perceived risk, and convenience perceived most beneficial while financial risk perceived riskiest for using fintech technology by the bankers of bahrain"
2020-0138,0,"the initial coin offering is usually defined as a new, innovative way of raising funds used by organizations, companies, or entrepreneurs, attracting funds through a cryptographic exchange in exchange for the coins that can be sold, used for future products or services purchase or profit"
2020-0138,1,this article provides an overview of the evolving ico market and indicates the main advantages and risks of the ico
2020-0138,2,"it is pointed out that ico offers many advantages, such as high liquidity, return on investment, availability, fast capital raising process, minimization of capital raising costs"
2020-0138,3,"nonetheless, the noticeable benefits of icos are often available only when companies or investors agree to take considerable risks, caused by the information asymmetry, lack of investor protection, proper regulation and methodical guidance both for investors and entrepreneurs"
2020-0138,4,"considering the novelty, volatility, emerging risks, growing popularity of the ico market and the lack of research in the scientific literature, it is important to investigate the factors that influence the success of the ico, which is usually defined as the amount of funds attracted, listing of the coins, return on investment, market capitalization or the duration of the ico"
2020-0272,0,article 36 of the eu payment services directive 2 no
2020-0272,1,"2015/2366 (hereinafter also referred to as psd2) awards digital operators, so-called third-party payment providers (tpps), the right to freely access users payment accounts data (known as the xs2a rule), typically retained by incumbent banks to provide payment initiating services (pis) or account information services (ais)"
2020-0272,2,the stated goal of the xs2a rule is to help an infant industry grow: that of fintech payment services
2020-0272,3,"however, mounting evidence suggests that unlike fintech startups, big techs may benefit from the norm, putting a much stronger challenge to established banks"
2020-0272,4,"the latter indeed have less access to data about consumers behavior (preferences, habits and conducts), less analytics capacity, and thus are placed in a competitive disadvantage by the xs2a, compared to their big tech rivals"
2020-0272,5,"according to many, that may result in competition harm and consumer welfare reduction in the medium and long run"
2020-0272,6,the article revisits the rationales for introducing the xs2a rule by critically assessing its asserted goals (part 1)
2020-0272,7,"it then suggests (part 2) that to level the playing field among the market players involved and increase its overall proportionality, the norm be revisited"
2020-0272,8,"in the relationship between big tech and the banks, we propose to complement the xs2a rule with a reciprocity clause"
2020-0272,9,"instead of free access to customers account data, big tech would pay by counter-providing access to the behavioral data in their possession pertaining to the same customers concerned by the xs2a, and upon their consent"
2020-0272,10,data thus transmitted would only be available upon condition of reuse to increase the efficiency of the payment service provision
2020-0272,11,"reciprocity would greatly enhance data circulation among market participants, while fostering competition among them, creating incentives for more innovation and strengthening the overall proportionality of the xs2a rule"
2020-0271,0,modern applications of fintech are challenged by enormous volumes of financial data
2020-0271,1,one way to handle these is to adopt a streaming setting where data are only available to the algorithms during a very short time
2020-0271,2,"when a new data point (financial transaction) is generated, it needs to be processed directly, and be forgotten immediately after"
2020-0271,3,"especially, ongoing globalization efforts in fintech require modern methods of fault detection to be able to work efficiently through more than 10 000 financial transactions per second if they are to be deployed as a first line of defence"
2020-0271,4,this article investigates two algorithms able to perform well in this demanding setting: k-means and fado
2020-0271,5,"especially, this article provides supports for the claim that the use of multiple clusters does not necessarily translate into increased detection performance"
2020-0271,6,"to support this claim, results are reported when operating in a quasi-realistic case study of anti money laundering (aml) detection in real-time payment systems"
2020-0271,7,"we focus on two prototypical algorithms: the passive aggressive fado assuming a single cluster, and the well-known k-means algorithm working with k> clusters"
2020-0271,8,"we find-in this case-that the use of k-means with multiple clusters is unfavorable as 1) both tuning for k, as well as the need for additional complexity in the k-means algorithm challenges the computational constraints"
2020-0271,9,2) k-means introduces necessarily added variability (unreliability) in the results
2020-0271,10,"3) it requires dimensionality reduction, compromising interpretability of the detections"
2020-0271,11,4) the prevalence of singleton clusters adds unreliability to the outcome
2020-0271,12,this makes in the presented case fado favorable over k-means (with k>1)
2020-0140,0,small businesses are at the heart of most economies
2020-0140,1,yet their combination of high risk and opacity with uncertain return dissuades banks and other investors from providing the necessary financial backing to get a business off the ground
2020-0140,2,overcoming the significant asymmetries of information is simply not seen as worth the high transaction costs required
2020-0140,3,technologyparticularly digitalization and data analyticshas in recent years lowered the transaction costs of small business lending through automated systems capable of analyzing varied data sources indicative of the borrowers solvency and stability
2020-0140,4,"ownership of this data by large service providers has, in this new market, tended to indicate a potential capture of small business borrowers by the lending firms with the largest networks"
2020-0140,5,"this paper sketches the parameters of an application for the smart precision financing of small businesses, through an analysis of the legal and technological innovations that could be introduced to make such financing simpler while allowing the market to retain dynamism, thus increasing funding and funding options available to small businesses"
2020-0140,6,the precision financing concept seeks to decrease information asymmetry and transaction costs while also limiting agency risk of a borrower misapplying funds
2020-0140,7,the recommendations offered are also designed to be complementary to eventual business growth toward venture capital investment
2020-0087,0,an initial coin offering (ico) is an innovative way for entrepreneurs of blockchain companies to raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors
2020-0087,1,"regardless of its popularity, ico is still considered as a controversial activity that has emerged in the domain of financial technology (fintech)"
2020-0087,2,"however, even though icos have attracted much attention in the cryptocurrency market, research in this area is still sparse"
2020-0087,3,"in this article, we comment on recent work discussing information asymmetry in icos"
2020-0087,4,we explore the significance of the research in the fintech domain
2020-0087,5,we also point out interesting research questions in this area that are worthy of investigation and some directions for future research
2020-0199,0,peer-to-peer (p2p) lending has suffered a major setback in china of late
2020-0199,1,"prior to this, practitioners and researchers generally under-estimated the operational risks of the industry and the constraints imposed by social conditions"
2020-0199,2,"this has not necessarily resulted in a complete failure of the model, but does it have a chance of making a comeback in china? this is not likely in the financial cycle we're going through, because of the complicated factors involved"
2020-0199,3,"however, the experience offers an important cautionary tale for financial technology (fintech), and prompts thoughts about its future directions"
2020-0013,0,"the power of platform business models has grown as our economies become increasingly digital, but how companies address the challenge of platform growth to achieve a critical mass of users remains unclear"
2020-0013,1,"in this study, we take a business model (bm) perspective to understand how mobile payment platform providers go about addressing such a challenge"
2020-0013,2,"we studied how mobile payment providers engaged in innovation of their business models, and thus identified three pertaining aspects: rethinking the relationship management with retailers, creating partnerships with other actors in the payment ecosystem to complement and deliver the proposed value, and integrating and using front-end mobile technology"
2020-0013,3,"furthermore, our study suggests that mobile payment providers need to adapt their role within the ecosystem to scale the platform, and that it will depend on their choice of scope of geographic availability"
2020-0013,4,"finally, we suggest that mutual adaptation of bms of platform-associated actors leads to improved diffusion of the platform offer, which also hints at the need for researchers to revisit innovation diffusion and technology adoption theories by acknowledging the importance of the bm of the offer side of technology"
2020-0020,0,technological developments have given shape to robotic services which have forayed in the finance and investment industry in the form of robo-advisors
2020-0020,1,"robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like india, since early 2015"
2020-0020,2,this research explores the present state of robo-advisory services in the indian context and investigates how robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor
2020-0020,3,the present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts
2020-0020,4,"these experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from bfsi (banking and financial services industry), it (information technology), fintech (finance technology) and nbfcs (non-banking finance companies) in india"
2020-0020,5,"the researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about robo-advisory services"
2020-0020,6,each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis
2020-0020,7,"the transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review"
2020-0020,8,"the intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as indian market is concerned"
2020-0020,9,"the key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust"
2020-0020,10,our conclusion emphasizes the fact that robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors
2020-0020,11,robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors
2020-0270,0,peer-to-peer (p2p) lending has become an alternative source of profit by investors all over the world as well as an alternative option for lending both by the bank-able and unbankable market
2020-0270,1,"the paper seeks to explore and understand the drivers of p2p lending sectors in indonesia and to determine the challenges faced by the peer-to-peer lending sector in indonesia by analyzing the three perspectives of this sector: users (lenders & borrowers), businesses, and regulator"
2020-0270,2,a qualitative approach is used to collect and analyze data
2020-0270,3,"the data is collected through open-ended and in-depth interviews with users, companies and government agency"
2020-0270,4,a thematic analysis method using code mapping was developed during data analysis
2020-0270,5,"the finding shows different results, from the regulators perspective, business lending users and borrowers views"
2020-0270,6,"business opportunity and platform convenience are the drivers, policy risks and lending system are the challenges"
2020-0270,7,the paper concludes there is still a potential sector in an early stage of development
2020-0270,8,"many improvements can be done through regulations, businesses approach (i.e., policy), and user participation in supporting small businesses"
2020-0270,9,"the findings found that ojk might be one party that has planned far in the future of p2p lending, such as the planning of users data privacy regulations, and regulations for p2p lending businesses that will not be too strict and still supports its innovation and development"
2020-0270,10,"thus, with such changes, there could be more drivers and challenges in the future that can be explored"
2020-0270,11,icic international
2020-0021,0,"using representative us investor data, we investigate whether automated financial advisors, also referred to as robo-advisors, reduce investors demand for human financial advice offered by financial service providers"
2020-0021,1,our results provide a strong negative relationship between using robo-advisors and seeking human financial advice
2020-0021,2,we show that the substitution effect of robo-advisors is especially driven by investors who fear to be victimized by investment fraud
2020-0021,3,"our findings suggest that robo-advisors seem to offer a valid alternative for seeking investment advice, especially among those investors who worry about potential conflicts of interest that appear in the context of human financial advice"
2020-0145,0,"based on the assumption that economic freedom facilitates the growth of traditional economic sectors, this study seeks to understand the role it plays in fintech sector"
2020-0145,1,"for this purpose, by adopting the social network analysis methodological approach, it considers the geographical network of bitcoin transactions as a proxy to measure the national level of fintech development and compares it with a set of economic freedom indicators related to the top 70 world economies"
2020-0145,2,the analysis revealed significant relationships between the performed network centrality measures and national levels of economic freedom
2020-0145,3,"in particular, as confirmed by the implemented multilevel regression models, high levels of freedom to trade internationally combined with a restrained value of inflation and low administrative requirements can be considered as determining factors for fintech development"
2020-0145,4,"the study also showed a large number of bitcoin transactions conducted in those countries characterized by fewer capital controls and restrictions, a result that feeds suspicions of illegal behavior, such as money laundering or terrorism financing, carried out through the use of cryptocurrencies"
2020-0145,5,findings of this research might be strategic for fintech entrepreneurship and policymakers interested in designing policies that aim to foster innovative sectors while ensuring the legality of financial flows
2020-0033,0,europes road to regtech has rested upon four apparently unrelated pillars: (1) extensive reporting requirements imposed after the global financial crisis to control systemic risk and change in financial sector behaviour
2020-0033,1,(2) strict data protection rules reflecting european cultural concerns about data privacy and protection
2020-0033,2,(3) the facilitation of open banking to enhance competition in banking and particularly payments
2020-0033,3,and (4) a legislative framework for digital identification to further the european single market
2020-0033,4,the paper analyses these four pillars and suggests that together they are underpinning the development of a regtech ecosystem in europe and will continue to do so
2020-0033,5,"we argue that the european unions financial services and data protection regulatory reforms have unintentionally driven the use of regulatory technologies (regtech) by intermediaries, supervisors and regulators, and provided an environment within which regtech can flourish"
2020-0033,6,"the experiences of europe in this process will provide insights for other societies in developing their own regtech ecosystems in order to support more efficient, stable, inclusive financial systems"
2020-0030,0,purpose: this paper aims to undertake a thematic review of academic papers on financial technology (fintech) to identify three broad categories for the purpose of classifying extant literature
2020-0030,1,the paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field
2020-0030,2,"thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research"
2020-0030,3,"simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to fintech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them"
2020-0030,4,"finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing fintech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe"
2020-0030,5,"design/methodology/approach: a systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [ssrn]-29 papers, scopus-81, other sources-20) on fintech is carried out in this thematic paper"
2020-0030,6,"findings: this thematic paper divides fintech into three themes, i.e"
2020-0030,7,"financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation"
2020-0030,8,"the paper suggests that a thorough impact of fintech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front"
2020-0030,9,"it is noted that fintech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation"
2020-0030,10,research limitations/implications: the paper reports that fintech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the fintech industry  from academia to practitioners to regulators
2020-0030,11,"practical implications: the paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for fintech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators"
2020-0030,12,originality/value: the paper is believed to add value to the understanding of fintech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders
2020-0002,0,"this paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap in the existing literature on bitcoin, blockchain and fintech"

2020-0121,0,this paper investigates the role of financial technology (fintech) in propelling economic growth in indonesia from 1998 to 2018
2020-0121,1,"the fintech industry employs a technology-based business model to provide financial services, including lending, payment, investment, and financing services"
2020-0121,2,"the study is motivated by endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain technology as the most important driver of economic growth"
2020-0121,3,the study finds that fintech startups are positively correlated with indonesias economic growth
2020-0121,4,"fintech firms in their first year are found to be disruptive, but they fail to have serious consequences on indonesias economic growth"
2020-0121,5,"however, they seem to significantly encourage economic growth in their second year"
2020-0121,6,"these findings are derived after accounting for other important growth determinants, namely, capital per labor, foreign direct investment (fdi), stock market development, and trade openness"
2020-0099,0,"purpose: financial technology innovation within the developed world is driving financial markets, yet its adoption is lagging among consumers in emerging markets"
2020-0099,1,"at the same time, most african economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption"
2020-0099,2,"given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in south africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency"
2020-0099,3,"design/methodology/approach: a survey instrument based on the tpb was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the mancosa, cape town campus"
2020-0099,4,"for data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used"
2020-0099,5,findings: the findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency
2020-0099,6,subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence
2020-0099,7,"overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory"
2020-0099,8,research limitations/implications: the results of this study may not be generalisable to the wider population as it is only based on a cross-sectional study of a sample of adult students at a single institute in south africa
2020-0099,9,"originality/value: the contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in south africa using the tpb model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption"
2020-0099,10,studies of this nature may lead to the development of financial innovation in emerging markets through a nuanced understanding of consumer behaviour

2020-0380,2,"in the proposed system, face recognition and landmark detection methods are used to achieve identity recognition and liveness detection tasks from face images captured by a mobile phone"
2020-0380,3,"however, sometimes malicious actors attempt to use a face photo of owners to illegally access their accounts"
2020-0380,4,"to prevent the illegal access, we further design a mechanism for users to interact with the system and acess their accounts followed by random instructions"
2020-0380,5,"in the experiment, the accuracy and execution time results were found to be acceptable"
2020-0380,6,"in addition, we further recruited subjects for the purpose of a subjective evaluation using the system usability scale (sus) and the technology acceptance model (tam), and the results showed the proposed system is acceptable for use"
2020-0112,0,"in contemporary india, mobile payments started with the onset of delivery services known as immediate payment services (imps) started by the national payment corporation of india, setting the growth cycle in motion"
2020-0112,1,"mobile money has grown significantly, especially post demonetization, enabled by 'smart devices' such as smartphones, smartwatches, smart cards, toll payment devices, and voice-enabled products deploying the internet of things (lot)"

2020-0384,0,financial technology (fintech) services have developed rapidly on the world including in indonesia
2020-0384,1,the rapid development of fintech in indonesia was responded positively by the existence of several regulations issued by the financial services authority (ojk) and bank indonesia (bi)
2020-0384,2,"besides conventional fintech, sharia fintech in indonesia has also begun to develop where the indonesian ulema council (mui) has issued a fatwa on sharia-based information technology-based financing services (fatwa no.117 / dsn-mui / ix / 2018)"
2020-0384,3,"although sharia fintech has begun to develop, ojk has not accommodated the mui fatwa to be a binding regulation"
2020-0384,4,this will give an impact on legal uncertainty regarding supervising of sharia fintech
2020-0384,5,"ironically, both conventional and sharia fintech become a tool of crime related to the misused of consumer personal data unlawfully"
2020-0384,6,"to answer the problem, the methodology used of this article is juridical-normative with qualitative approach"
2020-0384,7,"the result of this study is although there are some regulations both conventional and sharia fintech, there are still violations of the law that harm consumers such as approval, supervision, law enforcement including violation of consumer personal data and the culture"

2020-0053,0,"using a large-scale dataset from three leading online peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platforms in indonesia from 2014 to 2018, we investigate the determinants of platform interest rate and borrowers default status"
2020-0053,1,"our result shows that loan and borrowers specific factors are significantly associated with the loan rate and loan default, although the relation could differ from one platform to another"
2020-0053,2,our empirical result shows that platforms focused on very small loan for microbusiness increase their interest rate after the introduction of formal regulation
2020-0053,3,it could be because of the increase of the borrowers requiring a very small amount of loan relatively much more than the number of lenders
2020-0053,4,the shortfall of supply then drives the increase in loan rate
2020-0053,5,some policy implications are discussed
2020-0052,0,purpose: the purpose of this paper is to determine the stakeholders acceptance on blockchain and to investigate the model fit by using technology acceptance model with special reference to corporate governance through cryptography to resolve the decades-old problems of financial record-keeping

2020-0101,1,"design/methodology/approach: by using on a dataset from 46 countries between 2009 and 2018, the authors use five measures of var to investigate their empirical dynamics in relation with the market value of fintech and non-fintech companies"
2020-0101,2,findings: the empirical results indicate that fintech firms' portfolios have a higher financial risk and a higher market value in comparison to non-fintech firms' portfolios
2020-0101,3,"furthermore, the authors also report that the fintech firm portfolios experience more financial risk regardless of the holding period as long-term (one year) or short-term (quarter)"
2020-0101,4,research limitations/implications: there are some limitations in this research
2020-0101,5,"this research does not segregate fintech firms into their different types of services, such as direct financial investment services, loan provision services, insurance services (insurtech), etc"
2020-0101,6,the authors only aggregate the fintech firms by country and region
2020-0101,7,"future research may consider analysing fintech firms by differentiating the kind of financial services they offer practical implications: given the importance of their market value, the results imply that fintech companies might contribute significantly to financial fluctuations in case of large variations of the market"
2020-0101,8,"in terms of policy recommendation, this observation requires a particular attention from the regulatory bodies who need to find the best economic balance between promoting innovation/financial technology and regulating the fintech companies"

2020-0162,0,financial risks associated with fintech have been increasing with its significant growth in recent years
2020-0162,1,"aiming at addressing the problem of identifying risks in online lending investment under a financial technology platform, we develop a q&a text risk recognition model based on attention mechanism and bi-directional long short-term memory"
2020-0162,2,"first, the q&a pairing on the text data set is carried out, and the matching data set is selected for the next analysis"
2020-0162,3,"secondly, the online loan investment platform is assessed by the named entity recognition of the question text"
2020-0162,4,"finally, the risk level of the corresponding investment platform is evaluated based on the answer text"
2020-0162,5,"the experimental results show that the proposed model has achieved improved precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy compared with other models"
2020-0162,6,our proposed model can be applied to identify the risks from the text posted on online loan investment platforms and can be used to guide investors investment and improve the management of financial technology platforms
2020-0409,0,the rapid emergence of risk management fintech has led to increasing use of alternative data in personal and business financing
2020-0409,1,yet there are significant risks and concerns resulting from using alternative data
2020-0409,2,we therefore seek to examine the differential role of alternative data in sme-focused fintech lending
2020-0409,3,we compare the credit evaluation and fraud detection contexts and examine the circumstances under which alternative data are useful for both contexts
2020-0409,4,our goal is to find a parsimonious set of traditional and alternative data types that can help facilitate risk management in sme-focused fintech lending
2020-0409,5,"in this short paper, we report some preliminary results and findings from the first phase of our data collection and analysis"
2020-0409,6,we then discuss the potential contributions and future plans of the study
2020-0410,0,"the fintech, as the progress in technology, transforms the financial and investment landscape, creating both opportunities and challenges for all participants, risks to the stability and integrity of the financial system"
2020-0410,1,"the dematerialization of payments introduces new participants and new products to the market, including non-financial entities"
2020-0410,2,"at the next stage of the fintech development, the importance of artificial intelligence and neurotechnology increases"
2020-0410,3,"as the fintech, the artificial intelligence and the neurotechnology cross national and international regulatory boundaries, the effective cross-sectoral and cross- domain coordination and the mixed financing for global financial investment strategies are critical both domestically and internationally"
2020-0410,4,"the particular importance gains the possibilities of resource-maneuvering in global investment strategies, and mechanisms - interoperability - coordination of various infrastructures, digital, financial, telecommunications, it, government regulation, international cooperation"
2020-0410,5,"due to the variety of such models, it is required to identify trends and promising areas of international coordination of fintech development [9]"
2020-0410,6,what are the factors drawing the development back? what new models of national and international coordination of these technologies are most effective for achieving sustainable development goals

2020-0412,0,"robo-advisors guide investors through an automated investment advisory process, recommend personalized portfolio assignments based on their individual risk-affinity as well as investment goals and rebalance the portfolio automatically over time"
2020-0412,1,"giving basic investment advice to customers, it can provide a useful way to reduce risk by diversifying and mitigating biases, while keeping a certain degree of performance at low costs"
2020-0412,2,"to verify these claims we conduct a sophisticated analysis of recommended portfolios of 36 robo-advisors, based on six distinct model customers with different risk-affinities and investment horizons, resulting in 216 recommended portfolios"
2020-0412,3,"we find that the analyzed robo-advisors provide distinct recommended portfolios for the different risk/investment horizon combinations, while sharing similarities in used products for portfolio allocation"
2020-0412,4,"we also find issues within the recommended portfolios, e.g"
2020-0412,5,a low degree of distinctiveness between different investment horizons and a high amount of equities even in the short-term investment horizon
2020-0413,0,"on social trading platforms, anyone can create investment portfolios and share them with others"
2020-0413,1,this leads to an abundance of portfolio strategies available to investors
2020-0413,2,"however, this variety comes with the drawback of high search costs for investors looking for the most promising portfolios to invest in"
2020-0413,3,"platform operators provide a ranking on these portfolios, thus making it easier for investors and reducing search costs"
2020-0413,4,"in our study, we analyze the value of this ranking regarding various aspects and especially against the background of its protective function in turbulent market phases"
2020-0413,5,"for this purpose, we look at the stock market crash in connection with the covid-19 pandemic"
2020-0413,6,"our results show (i) that investors on social trading platforms are making use of the ranking, (ii) that the ranking offers value for these investors, and (iii) protects them from extreme losses in downward periods"
2020-0413,7,the ranking we analyzed rather identifies portfolios with a more successful market timing than those with an effective stock selection
2020-0413,8,we further show that changes in the ranking tend to contribute to procyclical behavior (iv)
2020-0413,9,"finally, we provide preliminary evidence that indicates rankings influence on the behavior of traders"
2020-0414,0,purpose: this paper aims to investigate the effects of eliminating riba in foreign currency transactions
2020-0414,1,riba or interest arises when foreign currencies are bought and sold at different rates
2020-0414,2,"from the islamic perspective, the difference between the buying and selling rates of foreign exchange will constitute riba"
2020-0414,3,"also, this paper examines the effects of eliminating such riba on major macroeconomic variables"
2020-0414,4,"design/methodology/approach: this study is based on the hadith which imply that if buying and selling rates of currencies or foreign exchanges are same, i.e"
2020-0414,5,"if one sells bd1 = dh10 and dh10 = bd1 on spot, there will be no riba"
2020-0414,6,"this can be guaranteed if the islamic banking system introduces the technology, often known as fintech interest-free foreign exchange bank machines (iffexbm), which will automatically dispense bd10 for dh100 and vice-versa, both locally and globally, and it will have tremendous positive effects in the economy"
2020-0414,7,"furthermore, the effects of introducing fintech for eliminating riba will be analyzed on economic and international trade activities by using aggregate expenditure (ae) and aggregate output model within the tenets of islamic principles"
2020-0414,8,"findings: if islamic banks (ibs) can introduce fintech global network system where any client can buy or sell foreign currency at the same rate without any markup, it will increase the market share for ibs by increasing the number of customers and number of branches, and it will increase the inflow of funds and volumes of transactions, especially in international trade, global financial transactions and cross-border shopping"
2020-0414,9,such an increase in transactions will increase ae and ae will continuously shift up
2020-0414,10,"such an upward shift will have positive effects on equilibrium output, employment and prosperity"
2020-0414,11,"originality/value: this is, perhaps, one of the latest attempts to eliminate riba from foreign exchange transactions by introducing fintech iffexbm in each and every locality"
2020-0414,12,"such elimination of riba will not only reduce the cost of cross-border transactions but it will also reduce cost in international trade and financial transactions among nations, and therefore, it will have expansionary effects on equilibrium output, employment and global prosperity"
2020-0120,0,the aim of the study generally is to explore the fintech factors affecting banking performance in the kingdom of bahrain

2020-0415,2,"our paper responds to a gap in literature that on the subject of regtech is mainly based on legal, defining arguments and about reviewing the literature on the macro context and the issues generated by the huge amount of regulation"
2020-0415,3,the article will explore three cases of regtech companies in italy presenting advantages and criticalities in the adoption of regtech solutions on the italian market
2020-0415,4,methods/approach: today the literature about case study in regtech is not proposing any solution of cooperation on the regulatory field in italy
2020-0415,5,so we have to fill the gap we find in exploration of literature
2020-0415,6,an analysis in the field cannot be separated from a preliminary systematic review of the literature on regulatory case studies
2020-0415,7,we begin our scientific analysis of the subject through a preliminary literature review individuating any case study around regtech through exploratory case study
2020-0415,8,"due to the scarcity of papers about case study in regtech field, we adopt an approach already used for well-studied cases widespread in the fintech area and an exploratory investigation through in deep interviews following models used in fintech area and in erm field"
2020-0415,9,"results/findings: in this article, we will, therefore, propose case studies in the fintech sector applied to regulatory technology in italy and we expect to answer the following research questions: we present three regtech's cases in italy's financial system exposing the fields of collaboration with financial institutions in regtech field between incumbents and regtech industries"
2020-0415,10,we expose also how big i.t

2020-0415,13,implications: understand how financial companies through regulatory technology can: improve risk management and governance in financial institutions
2020-0415,14,"improve prudential compliance, anti money laundering and customer protection"
2020-0415,15,reduce the risks of traditional banking business through better knowledge and customer identification and profiling may also offer more favourable terms to companies and lowering compliance costs to shift economic resources towards fintech's disruptive innovation
2020-0260,0,the traditional blockchain has the shortcoming that a single-chain can only deal with one or a few specific data types
2020-0260,1,the research question of how to make blockchain be able to deal with various data types has not been well studied
2020-0260,2,"in this paper, we propose a single-chain based extension model of blockchain for fintech (sebf)"
2020-0260,3,"in the financial environment, we design a four-layer architecture for this model"
2020-0260,4,"by employing the external trusted oracle group and a financial regulator agency, a variety types of data can be effectively stored in the blockchain, such that the data type extension based on a single-chain is realized"
2020-0260,5,the experimental results indicate that the proposed model can improve the efficiency of simplified payment verification
2020-0416,0,cryptocurrency has become most sought after digital payment system these days and has been regarded as the safest mode of transferring money and making payments

2020-0259,6,"large variation in msme educational background, busineess age and size would become a challenge in promoting fintech application, therefore this finding suggests that fintech should be promoted by highlighting what benefits can be obtained by using fintech application"
2020-0258,0,prior studies have shown that social media discussions can be helpful in predicting price movements in financial markets
2020-0258,1,"with the increasingly large amount of social media data, how to effectively distinguish value-relevant information from noise remains an important question"
2020-0258,2,we study this question by investigating the role of network cohesion in the relationship between social media sentiment and price changes in the bitcoin market
2020-0258,3,"as network cohesion is associated with information correlation within the discussion network, we hypothesize that less cohesive social media discussion networks are better at predicting the next-day returns than more cohesive networks"
2020-0258,4,both regression analyses and trading simulations based on data collected from bitcointalk.org confirm our hypothesis
2020-0258,5,our findings enrich the literature on the role of social media in financial markets and provide actionable insights for investors to trade based on social media signals

2020-0049,4,"this paper is the result of a survey that aims to clarify how well the impact of fintech services, benefits and security on their preferences in transacting on line"
2020-0049,5,the hypothesis tested is ready to use the services provided by fintech especially those who are millennial
2020-0049,6,the results of this study prove the hypothesis: they show that respondents are generally happy about fintech services in jakarta area of new digital financial products
2020-0049,7,this paper also provides information about the strategies used
2020-0417,0,"nowadays, there are several options when it comes to making use of products that facilitate financial services to people through virtual wallets"
2020-0417,1,a recommender system quickly provides customers with what they are looking for and helps discover new products that they like
2020-0417,2,"in this paper, a recommender system is proposed that can be customized according to the variables implemented by movii, a company in the colombian fintech sector, taking as input transaction records that indicate the frequency of use of each product, which can be understood as ratings of these products"
2020-0417,3,"to determine the model that will implement the recommender system that will be deployed, different models are evaluated, such as techniques based on collaborative filtering"
2020-0417,4,"in our evaluation, we found that the model that recommends the most popular products is the one that offers the best performance in recommending a product to users"

2020-0084,0,"the article considers the opportunities, risks, and challenges associated with the development of digital financial technologies"
2020-0084,1,"to identify them, we used the scenario approach"
2020-0084,2,"we determined three main development scenarios for the market of innovative financial technologies  domination of traditional financial companies, segmentation of market of new financial technologies, and domination of digital financial companies in terms of their probability and possible consequences for the global financial markets"
2020-0084,3,"the results of analysis allowed us to suggest that among main scenarios of fintech development the most probable is the splitting of existing market, which in the future can turn into a market of digital transnational financial corporations, which will squeeze out both small companies and traditional financial giants"
2020-0084,4,"however, although the scenario of capturing the financial market by large players is currently unlikely, it is certainly more important in terms of the consequences for global markets"
2020-0084,5,the main prerequisite for the latter scenario is the promotion of international cooperation in the regulation of digital financial companies
2020-0084,6,such a condition requires new models of country-level interaction in the regulation of innovative financial companies in order to address the risks and challenges of different scenarios of fintech development on global financial markets
2020-0084,7,"this article includes a comparative analysis of digital development in russia and the republic of korea, which is one of the key players on the asian fintech market, as a possible benchmark that can be used to shape the policies of intergovernmental cooperation on global financial markets"
2020-0084,8,these policies include 1) regulatory cooperation that reduces risks due to growing experience in the regulation of innovative financial companies
2020-0084,9,"2)cooperation in investments that allow one to acquire additional experience in regulatory practices and to develop infrastructure, which meets the new requirements of digital finance"
2020-0084,10,and 3) cooperation in the taxation of fintech companies that reduces cross-border regulatory arbitrage
2020-0163,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to investigate and explain pathways through which mobile money can improve financial inclusion
2020-0163,1,design/methodology/approach: the study used 294 survey responses from mobile money users in ghana
2020-0163,2,the data were analysed using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca)
2020-0163,3,findings: the findings reveal four pathways for improving financial inclusion through mobile money
2020-0163,4,"in addition, the study identified three distinct user topologies as well as their associated pathways through which mobile money can be used to improve financial inclusion"
2020-0163,5,practical implications: managers and financial service organisations need to design products and services to align with different pathways and user topologies to improve financial inclusion through mobile money
2020-0163,6,"moreover, they need to take into account peoples diverse social and economic backgrounds"
2020-0163,7,originality/value: the study makes theoretical and empirical contributions by unpacking pathways through which mobile money can improve financial inclusion
2020-0163,8,"in addition, this study reveals three distinct user topologies, being ease-of-use, behavioural intention and coverage-price-service driven and associated pathways through which mobile money can improve financial inclusion"
2020-0163,9,these pathways and user topologies are important to tailor mobile money services and financial inclusion policies
2020-0163,10,"lastly, this study is arguably the first to utilise the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) in fsqca to extend the mobile money literature"
2020-0418,0,funding assistance from non-bank financial institutions such as the peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platform is needed by microenterprises in order to improve their quality of life
2020-0418,1,"unlike banks, through the p2p platform, applicants can receive business capital easily and without complicated requirements"
2020-0418,2,this is especially important for islamic micro enterprises (imes) in indonesia which are strongly constrained by a lack of financing from both conventional and islamic banks
2020-0418,3,"therefore, this study aims to examine the impacts of sharia p2p lending on the business performance of imes in indonesia, based on a case study of pt"
2020-0418,4,ammana fintek syariah (ammana)
2020-0418,5,"until mid 2019, ammana is the pioneer and the only sharia p2p lender providing financial support to imes in indonesia"
2020-0418,6,the study collected primary data from ammana loan customers and employed a multivariate regression model to examine the relationships between the amount of financing and the imes business performance
2020-0418,7,the main findings show that the amount of financing provided by the islamic p2p lending and family involvement in managing the micro businesses have a positive effect on the imes profits
2020-0418,8,"contrastingly, having too many employees has a negative effect on the profits"
2020-0418,9,"age, education and competition do not significantly impact profits"
2020-0418,10,"overall, the study suggests that islamic p2p lending indeed plays a positive role in the ime business performance in indonesia"
2020-0418,11,"the bigger the loan, the greater is the impact"
2020-0418,12,the results are expected to provide insights in developing islamic p2p lending in indonesia and ultimately enrich empirical literature regarding contemporary islamic finance
2020-0419,0,"the main purpose of this introductory chapter is to give an overview of the following 130 papers, which discuss financial econometrics, mathematics, statistics, and machine learning"
2020-0419,1,there are eight sections in this introductory chapter
2020-0419,2,"section 1 is the introduction, section 2 discusses financial econometrics, section 3 explores financial mathematics, and section 4 discusses financial statistics"
2020-0419,3,"section 5 of this introductory chapter discusses financial technology and machine learning, section 6 explores applications of financial econometrics, mathematics, statistics, and machine learning, and section 7 gives an overview in terms of chapter and keyword classification of the handbook"
2020-0419,4,"finally, section 8 is a summary and includes some remarks"
2020-0144,0,"the rapid increase in the number of fintech companies in indonesia in the past three years has attracted the attention of many stakeholders, including the government, investors, conventional bank management, and even the general public"
2020-0144,1,the phenomenon of the development of peer-to-peer lending fintech companies in indonesia is supported by the increasing demand of consumers
2020-0144,2,"the research objective is to provide insight into the determinants of consumer interest in using fintech applications, using the technology acceptance model by added e-trust variables"
2020-0144,3,the data analysis method used structural equation modeling with warppls 6.0 software
2020-0144,4,"questionnaires were distributed to fintech consumers in indonesia, with a total sample of 379 respondents"
2020-0144,5,"the results of this study indicate that the dimensions of e-trust contribute to determining the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude to adopt peer-to-peer lending fintech services, and intention to use peer-to-peer lending applications"
2020-0164,0,growing fintech entrepreneurship is a recent global phenomenon
2020-0164,1,"drawing on the national innovation systems framework, we examine how countries venture capital (vc) and credit markets differently affect fintech entrepreneurship across countries"
2020-0164,2,"we argue that with their established and globally diffused norms and practices, vc investorsbut not banksrequire a critical mass of fintech entrepreneurship in a country to more positively influence fintech entrepreneurship"
2020-0164,3,"moreover, we argue that vc and credit markets are substitutes, especially in countries with more fintech entrepreneurship"
2020-0164,4,"using quantile regressions on data from 53 countries, we find support for our hypotheses"
2020-0420,0,"little is known about racial patterns in fintech mortgage lending, despite evidence of racial disparities in the broader mortgage market"
2020-0420,1,this study leverages 20152017 home mortgage disclosure act data to assess disparities in lending outcomes between white and non-white applicants and between neighborhoods of varying racial composition in the united states 200 largest metropolitan areas at fintech and traditional lenders
2020-0420,2,"results of a series of binary logistic regression models suggest disparities in rates of loan approvals between white and similarly qualified non-white applicants are substantively small overall, but lower at fintech lenders relative to traditional lenders, most substantially for latinos"
2020-0420,3,"non-white applicants are more likely to receive subprime terms relative to similarly qualified white applicants at both lender types, and disparities in rates of subprime loan receipt between black and similarly qualified white applicants are greater at fintech lenders than traditional lenders"
2020-0420,4,neighborhood racial composition has a mixed but substantively small impact on approval rates at both lender types
2020-0420,5,"however, both lender types distribute subprime credit to non-white neighborhoods at significantly higher rates than to white neighborhoods"
2020-0420,6,findings suggest fintech lending contributes to racial and spatial disparities in subprime mortgage lending and warrants increased scrutiny from regulators
2020-0421,0,the proposal to switch to bills and notes might be shocking
2020-0421,1,"the fact that act clxxxv of 2017 on the regulations for bills of exchange and promissory notes entered into effect in hungary on 1 january 2018 in order to enforce the uniform regulations pertaining to the legislation on bills of exchange and promissory notes, yet we still cannot talk about the issuance and use of bills and notes, is just as odd"
2020-0421,2,"in our study, we argue that in the absence of other short-term corporate securities, bills and notes could help the liquidity management of smes owing to their elaborated legal background"
2020-0421,3,"we briefly present the importance of corporate securities in the financing of companies both on domestic and international level, as well as the evolution of financial services related to bills and notes in the mirror of the statistics of the hungarian supervisory authority, and we also provide possible ways for developing the financial services related to bills and notes"
2020-0421,4,we review the previous and current hungarian legal-regulatory environment of bills and notes and then summarise the arguments for their use in hungary
2020-0165,0,digital entrepreneurship possesses immense societal implications beyond its commercial significance
2020-0165,1,yet our knowledge of the emancipatory potential of digital entrepreneurship remains limited because few studies have gone beyond the conventional emphasis on profits and wealth creation
2020-0165,2,"drawing on the emancipatory perspective that views entrepreneurship as change creation through the removal of constraints, this article examines how emancipation can occur through the actions of digital entrepreneurs"
2020-0165,3,"using an empirical investigation of entrepreneurial endeavours set against disadvantaged communities in indonesia, we uncover constraints facing a developing economy and the role of digital technologies in ameliorating them"
2020-0165,4,"through extensive fieldwork and in-depth case study analyses, we identify constraining societal norms and restrictive practices, as well as the three forms of digital enablement - to emulate services, aggregate capital and equalise opportunities  necessary for the enactment of digitally enabled emancipation"
2020-0165,5,we present a framework to illustrate the enactment of emancipatory digital entrepreneurship for the inclusive development of businesses and communities
2020-0422,0,financial systems worldwide are increasingly experiencing the mounting pressure of the technology-based financial innovations
2020-0422,1,"some of these developments are generating alternative financial structures existing parallelly to the ""old""ones, whereas some others are simply replacing the ""old""ones"
2020-0422,2,"alternative intermediating institutions are gaining ground vis-a-vis incumbents, relying on their technological and market supremacy"
2020-0422,3,the space of traditional financial intermediation requires new solutions to be more competitive
2020-0422,4,"some technological solutions provide additionally for the partial or entire disintermediation of the financial services, thus removing some existing transaction costs and matching directly economic agents"
2020-0422,5,"digitalization and datafication, coupled with artificial intelligence, are offering immense new operational opportunities and economic benefits"
2020-0422,6,"on the other hand, they are also the source of new risks to the financial and economic systems, financial stability, national security, and consumer well-being, which need to be properly addressed"
2020-0422,7,"we review in this paper principal components of the current stream of technology-based financial innovations and their main drivers, as well as discuss major strategic issues and impacts that we are facing in this area"
2020-0257,0,the popularity and potential of fintech for generating business value has been highlighted in an evolving number of studies
2020-0257,1,"nevertheless, there is still ambiguity on the success of such disruptive technologies"
2020-0257,2,"to address this gap, this paper draws on a case study of an it vendor in japan"
2020-0257,3,"we interview key stakeholders involved in the case project to (i) explore the success factors of fintech applications adopted by non-financial organisations, (ii) illustrate the applicability of the multi-dimensional project success framework in fintech projects, and (iii) highlight the importance of the fintech project management field that warrants further investigation"
2020-0257,4,"we contribute to the it project management field, where we extend the theoretical background with aspects of fintech adoption and success"
2020-0257,5,we also inform practice in terms of lessons for managers to improve the existing processes and assist their organisations in business transformational initiatives using fintech
2020-0256,0,[no abstract available
2020-0255,0,"with the rapid development of peer-to-peer (p2p) lending in the financial field, abundant data of lending agencies have appeared"
2020-0255,1,p2p agencies also have problems such as absconded with ill-gotten gains and out of business
2020-0255,2,"therefore, it is urgent to use the interpretable ai in fintech to evaluate the lending risk effectively"
2020-0255,3,"in this paper we use the machine learning and deep learning method to model and analyze the unstructured natural language text of p2p agencies, and we propose an interpretable machine learning method to evaluate the fraud risk of p2p agencies, which enhances the credibility of the ai model"
2020-0255,4,"first, this paper explains model behavior based on the psychological interpersonal fraud theory in the field of social science"
2020-0255,5,"at the same time, the nlp and influence function in the field of natural science are used to verify that the machine learning model really learns the information of part-of-speech details in the fraud theory, which provides the psychological interpretable support for the model of p2p risk evaluation"
2020-0255,6,"in addition, we propose style vectors to describe the overall differences between text styles of p2p agencies and understand model behavior"
2020-0255,7,experiments show that using style vectors and influence functions to describe text style differences is the same as human intuitive perception
2020-0255,8,"this proves that the machine learning model indeed learn the text style difference and use it for risk evaluation, which further shows that the model has a certain machine learning interpretability"

2020-0424,0,the poor use of innovations for financial service delivery among african banks has limited the extent of financial development in the continent
2020-0424,1,"consequently, financial authorities seeks for a technology-enabled financial solution"
2020-0424,2,an area not well covered in literature
2020-0424,3,"this study therefore, examines the determinants of financial development in a panel of thirty-one heterogeneous african markets for the period 20022019 with emphasis on financial technology (fintech)"
2020-0424,4,the liquidity-preference and credit-creation theories were used to model a dummy variable interactive equation to capture possible heterogeneities
2020-0424,5,"the study hypothesized that fintech transmits directly to financial development among emerging africa but indirectly through bank-efficiency and financial inclusion among the frontier and fragile groups, respectively"
2020-0424,6,results from both the dynamic system gmm and the static techniques support this hypothesis with significant heterogeneities in both the intercept and slope coefficients of fintech among the various groups
2020-0424,7,"the study concludes that on average, emerging african markets report higher financial depth than the frontier and fragile groups"
2020-0424,8,"however, with higher slopes, they can converge with emerging markets in the long-run through fintech adoption"
2020-0424,9,"the study recommends the collaboration of fintech with banks, improved bank efficiency and financial inclusion as panaceas to promote financial development in africa"
2020-0425,0,"due to the rapid spread of it and services, most banking services are turning to boost a finance industry"
2020-0425,1,"fintech, a combination of finance and technology, has created a new financial transaction model that is differentiated from existing financial transaction methods by combining innovative ideas and advanced technologies"
2020-0425,2,"the development of this innovative technology industry has especially influenced mobile technology, and furthermore, it has promoted the growth of the financial industry"
2020-0425,3,"in korea, the internet primary bank was combined with new financial services with fintech it convergence in 2017"
2020-0425,4,the internet primary bank combined with these advanced technologies have made a big difference in korea's financial market
2020-0425,5,it was also surprising to see the number of consumers in korea
2020-0425,6,"but, really important is to maintain a consistent customer reuse intention"
2020-0425,7,"this study investigated factors affecting the intention to continuously use it for consumers using kakao bank, which shows a higher status of subscription retention than k-bank"
2020-0425,8,this study aims to analyze the factors affecting the actual reuse intention through the experience of using internet primary bank
2020-0425,9,"for this study, the main variables of the expanded technology acceptance model were modified and applied to establish a research model for variables affecting the intention to reuse"
2020-0425,10,this research can help for marketing by checking the impact variables on the internet primary bank reuse intention

2020-0426,1,"specifically, the chapter investigates the role of disruptive financial technology in financial inclusion, focusing on mobile money transactions on entrepreneurship"
2020-0426,2,looking at the role of digital money on entrepreneurship matters greatly because self-employment is a sustainable route out of poverty
2020-0426,3,the study shows that the use of mobile money technology is not necessarily for investment purposes and to make livelihood changes by investing in the creation of new enterprises or self-employment ventures
2020-0426,4,"most of the current use of mobile money is for transaction payments, such as utility bills and/or payment of fees, like tuition fees"
2020-0166,0,"what has boosted crowdfundings growth? in the case of peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, we highlight the role of consumers distrust in banks"
2020-0166,1,we offer evidence that distrust in banks likely triggers individuals to supply funding toward crowdfunding and away from bank deposits
2020-0166,2,"we highlight that a distrust mindset promotes questioning default choices and considering alternatives, and fosters comparisons focusing on dissimilarities"
2020-0166,3,"our findings suggest us states whose residents express greater distrust in banks are more likely to fund p2p loans and, conditional on funding, lend higher amounts"
2020-0166,4,this relationship is more pronounced when funding small loans or borrowers with less banking access
2020-0254,0,trading systems have become sophisticated multi-agent infrastructures with complex development cycles
2020-0254,1,this is why the financial industry constantly seeks for novel approaches to design and validate these systems
2020-0254,2,we propose the use of models to support such tasks
2020-0254,3,"on the one hand, these models need to describe how objects (e.g., orders to buy/sell securities) are shared by the system and traders"
2020-0254,4,"on the other hand, being a dynamic multi-agent system, models of trading systems should have a clear structure, describing how participants interact between each other"
2020-0254,5,"in this paper, we address these requirements, integrating notions of various petri net extensions"
2020-0254,6,"in particular, we discuss modeling capabilities/limitations of each extension, and we propose to integrate them into a single approach, allowing for comprehensive modeling of different trading system components"

2020-0253,0,money laundering is a major threat to the good functioning of financial systems
2020-0253,1,"despite huge technological investments, with machine learning at the heart of the fintech revolution, we are still lacking explainable solutions in fighting money laundering, especially for financial intelligence units (fius)"
2020-0253,2,this paper is based on the joint committment of the fintech community and academia in applying state-of-the-art rule-based reasoning to counteract money laundering
2020-0253,3,we report a visionary position about the application of logic-based knowledge graphs and reasoning with languages in the datalog+/- family in the anti-money laundering (aml) domain
2020-0253,4,"after motivating the impact and the importance of an explainable rule-based solution, we pin down the core aml problems in the form of high-level decision tasks"
2020-0253,5,"we envision that the fiu knowledge is modeled as the ground truth of a kg, so that aml tasks are formulated and carried out as reasoning tasks, addressing specific quality desiderata"
2020-0253,6,we provide technical zoom and concrete exemplification of the approach with a real money laundering case
2020-0253,7,we discuss relevant research and technological challenges
2020-0252,0,aim/purpose this study aimed to examine the effect of marketing knowledge management (mkm) on bank performance via the mediating role of the fintech innovation in jordanian commercial banks
2020-0252,1,"background an extensive number of studies found a significant relationship between marketing knowledge management and bank performance (e.g., akroush & al-mohammad, 2010"
2020-0252,2,hou & chien 2010
2020-0252,3,"rezaee & jafari, 2015"
2020-0252,4,"veismoradi et al., 2013)"
2020-0252,5,"however, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between marketing knowledge management (mkm) and bank performance (bp)"
2020-0252,6,"furthermore, the linkage between mkm and bp is not straightforward but, instead, includes a more complicated relationship"
2020-0252,7,"therefore, it is argued that managing marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities can enhance performance via the role of financial innovation as a mediating factor on commercial banks"
2020-0252,8,"to date, however, there is no empirical evidence"
2020-0252,9,"methodology based on a literature review, knowledge-based theory, and financial innovation theory, an integrated conceptual framework has been developed to guide the study"
2020-0252,10,"a quantitative approach was used, and the data was collected from 336 managers and employees in all 13 jordanian commercial banks using online and in hand instruments"
2020-0252,11,structural equation modeling (sem) was used to analyze and verify the study variables
2020-0252,12,contribution this article contributes to theory by filling a gap in the literature regarding the role of marketing knowledge management assets and capabilities in commercial banks operating in a developing country like jordan
2020-0252,13,it empirically examined and validated the role of fintech innovation as mediators between marketing knowledge management and bank performance findings the main findings revealed that marketing knowledge management had a significant favorable influence on bank performance
2020-0252,14,fintech innovation acted as partial mediators in this relationship
2020-0252,15,recommendations commercial banks should be fully aware of the importance of knowledge man-for practitioners agement practices to enhance their financial innovation and bank performance
2020-0252,16,they should also consider promoting a culture of practicing knowledge management processes among their managers and employees by motivating and training to promote innovations
2020-0252,17,"recommendations the result endorsed fintech innovation's mediating effect on the relationship for researchers between the independent variable, marketing knowledge management (assets and capabilities), and the dependent variable bank performance, which was not addressed before"
2020-0252,18,"thus, it needs further validation"
2020-0252,19,"future research the current designed research model can be applied and assessed further in other sectors, including banking and industrial sectors across developed and developing countries"
2020-0252,20,"it would also be of interest to introduce other variables in the study model that can act as consequences of mkm capabilities, such as financial and non-financial performance measures"
2020-0274,0,digital transformation has affected many industries and has become a mega-trend in the information technology systems
2020-0274,1,"however, the venture capital investment process is still rigid"
2020-0274,2,the use of distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence in the field of finance and investment requires a detailed framework and a rethinking of the interaction model of market participants
2020-0274,3,the article shows the dlt based approach with attached of f-bft consensus to improve the efficiency of the investment process in the modern world
2020-0263,0,organisations usually tailor agile methods to fit their needs best
2020-0263,1,spotify has developed its own agile culture to facilitate software development for hundreds of developers across multiple cities
2020-0263,2,the spotify model has become influential among agile proponents and hence formed the basis of methods used in other organisations
2020-0263,3,we have identified a lack of research into agile architecture using the spotify model
2020-0263,4,"to explore how can architectural governance increase the autonomy of teams when using the spotify model?, an intervention embedded case study was conducted in a multinational fintech organisation, using the spotify model"
2020-0263,5,new processes were introduced by developing and evaluating an approach to agile architectural governance
2020-0263,6,this approach incorporates a structural change and a change management process
2020-0263,7,we conducted 6 semi-structured open-ended interviews and direct observations of agile practices
2020-0263,8,the collected data was analysed using thematic analysis and informed by some grounded theory techniques
2020-0263,9,the practitioners in our study report benefits of this evaluated approach
2020-0263,10,"these benefits include transforming architectural based decision into decentralised based decision-making, strengthening the autonomy of squads through aligning architectural based decisions, sharing the architectural knowledge among the squads, and other benefits"
2020-0263,11,we identify the characteristics and benefits of our evaluated approach to agile architectural governance using the spotify model
2020-0263,12,"also, we identify guidelines and challenges for those wishing to adopt this approach"
2020-0427,0,"due to information asymmetry in the lending market, credit activities inevitably cause pre- and post-loan risk in banks"
2020-0427,1,"to explore whether these risks can be alleviated by fintech and study its specific mechanism from the perspective of managers, we investigate on a sample from the establishment of fintech subsidiaries in chinese commercial banks during 20142018"
2020-0427,2,"the results show that fintech can alleviate pre-loan risk associated with credit activities, and this negative effect is more pronounced in banks with higher level of managerial ownership"
2020-0427,3,"as the control of post-loan risk is more dependent on the regulators, fintech in banks has no significant effect on reducing post-loan risk associated with credit activities"
2020-0427,4,this paper adds empirical evidence on the role of fintech in banks
2020-0428,0,the european wave of regulatory interventions aimed at promoting access to data and data sharing shows no signs of stopping
2020-0428,1,"however, concerns are being expressed about alleged unintended consequences of data portability in financial markets"
2020-0428,2,"in particular, new calls have been voiced to contain the engagement of bigtech platforms with retail banking"
2020-0428,3,the paper argues that asymmetrical regulatory measures imposed on bigtechs entry in the financial industry may tilt the market in favour of incumbent banks
2020-0428,4,"indeed, as fintech start-ups seem more likely to work alongside incumbent banks rather than compete with them, limiting the entry of bigtechs may remove the only effective source of competitive pressure for traditional bank, thereby ultimately frustrating the pro-competitive potential of the access to account rule enshrined in the revised payment service directive (psd2)"
2020-0167,0,"this study employed the panel ardl (1, 1) pooled mean group, mean group and dynamic fixed effect estimators to investigate the relationship between financial technology (fintech) and bank credit risk measured in terms of nonperforming loan to total loan (npl) among the brics (brazil, russia, india, china and south africa) economies over the 1995-2018 period"
2020-0167,1,the study made a novel contribution to fintechs' data series by generating an indicator for fintech using the principal component analysis
2020-0167,2,the findings reveal a consistent result with previous studies that both macroeconomic and bank-specific factors drive credit risk
2020-0167,3,we also found a non-linear relationship between fintechs and credit risk
2020-0167,4,the u-shaped relationship between fintechs and npl revealed that brics economies face a dampening impact of fintech on npl to a certain threshold after which further adoption of fintechs will significantly raise credit risk
2020-0167,5,the robustness checks of the dynamic panel generalized methods of moments (gmm) and the fixed effect models also revealed a consistent conclusion
2020-0167,6,we recommend the optimization of the right fintech adoption with bank collaboration among the brics economies

2020-0069,0,this essay examines the current transformation of the chinese financial sector and the implications of chinese financial technology (fintech) development for countries in southeast asia
2020-0069,1,main argument china is home to some of the world's most innovative fintech companies
2020-0069,2,chinese fintech companies have been successful in promoting financial inclusion and integration in their home country and are attempting to replicate this success in southeast asian markets
2020-0069,3,"the rapid development of the chinese fintech industry can be attributed to various factors, including a high degree of technological savvy among chinese consumers, underdeveloped banking systems, a fintech-friendly regulatory environment, and china's improving scientific and technological prowess"
2020-0069,4,"chinese technology companies are also successfully exporting their programs and technology to southeast asia, where many markets have a comparable base for new financial technologies"
2020-0069,5,geographic proximity as well as ethnic and cultural connections between china and southeast asia are also major facilitators that can help chinese fintech companies succeed in the region
2020-0069,6,policy implications  strict data privacy laws and regulations requiring control and scrutiny of inbound foreign investments prevent chinese firms from engaging with western and other advanced markets
2020-0069,7,"due to the absence of these constraints in southeast asian markets, china's fintech firms are emerging as major competitors"
2020-0069,8,"many chinese fintech programs perform poorly with regard to security and privacy practices, which should be an issue of concern as they gain access to new markets"
2020-0069,9,chinese technology firms operating in southeast asia could be pressured by the chinese government to carry out censorship
2020-0069,10,"for example, wechat, used for messaging, social media, and mobile payments, has been accused of censorship activities in southeast asia and other foreign markets"
2020-0069,11,"western and other advanced economies such as japan must make special efforts to bring institutional changes to southeast asian markets for fintech products, especially in the areas of data privacy, cybersecurity, and surveillance"
2020-0069,12,there is a need for closer collaboration with like-minded governments on standards and consumer awareness of privacy and surveillance risks
2020-0069,13,"if consumers understand such risks, they are more likely to prefer fintech services provided by japanese and western firms"
2020-0139,0,this study examines the effect of fintech on retail banks stock return listed in indonesia stock exchange for the period of 2016-2018 as today's new technology lead to the emergence of fintech companies playing the same role as retail banks in the financial industry
2020-0139,1,"this study is conducted quantitatively using monthly data from january 2016 to october 2018 and uses fintech as independent variable, proxied by fintech funding frequency and fintech funding value"
2020-0139,2,data transformation is conducted due to data volatility
2020-0139,3,"the data of fintech funding, both frequency and value, is transformed into standardized fintech funding and growth of fintech funding"
2020-0139,4,"the data is obtained from crunchbase, while the data of stock returns is obtained from investing"
2020-0139,5,this study further analyzes the data using fama french three-factor model and panel data regression
2020-0139,6,we found that fintech has no significant effect on retail banks' stock returns listed in indonesia stock exchange for the period of 2016-2018
2020-0139,7,the findings of the study provide some useful insights in understanding fintech companies' current position to retail banks in indonesia
2020-0139,8,"this study also suggests banking institutions, fintech companies, policy-makers, and others to take advantageous steps in building inclusive financial sectors"
2020-0431,0,transition countries experienced massive emigration after the fall of the soviet union
2020-0431,1,many of them currently rely on remittances from abroad
2020-0431,2,"the number of remittances services providers is constantly growing, some studies speak about the uberisation of the remittances market"
2020-0431,3,"the paper focuses on six case countries: armenia, georgia, moldova, kyrgyzstan, tajikistan and ukraine"
2020-0431,4,it assesses the potential and current penetration of mobile money services on their remittance market
2020-0431,5,the paper finds the remittance market in the case countries to be highly competitive in terms of costs and variety of rsps
2020-0431,6,"telco operators from the case countries have expanded their services towards certain bank-like and mobile money-like services, but the only true mobile money service so far is present in armenia"
2020-0431,7,current portfolios of services offered by telco operators suggests that remittances inflows from russia are important for future development of mobile money
2020-0431,8,"the remittance market is thus important for mobile money development, but low costs are not the only enabling factor for these services"
2020-0431,9,"other important aspects are convenience, accessibility, speed, transparency of rates, etc"
2020-0431,10,"further development of mobile money in the case countries is highly probable, but it will most likely not be so intense as in other asian and african countries"
2020-0432,0,financial technology (fin tech) as a financial product and service through a combination of technology platforms and innovative business models
2020-0432,1,the development of fin tech encouraged ojk to issue a financial services authority regulation regarding lending and borrowing based on information technology
2020-0432,2,this regulation is expected to encourage alternative financing for the community
2020-0432,3,support the growth of technology-based financial services institutions to contribute to the national economy
2020-0432,4,"ojk regulation number: 77/pojk.01/2016 concerning information technology-based loan services only regulates peer to peer (p2p) lending activities, so that other fin tech models such as: non-financial crowd funding"
2020-0432,5,direct balance sheet or e-commerce loan
2020-0432,6,traditional credit rating and crowd funding security are not included in the scope of this regulatory arrangement
2020-0432,7,"based on legal relations, there is only an agreement between the lender and the borrower, while the provider does not include the parties in the agreement"
2020-0432,8,"in this case, when that happens, the most vulnerable party is the lender"
2020-0432,9,"therefore, it is necessary to provide clear legal protection for lenders"
2020-0433,0,social trading is a social network service (sns) trading platform where users can share their investment experience and knowledge
2020-0433,1,one of the notable features of social trading is that this platform allows users to imitate the transactions conducted by other traders simply by following them
2020-0433,2,"however, finding and following expert traders is the key challenge of social trading"
2020-0433,3,"to this end, systems and methods have been developed to rank traders"
2020-0433,4,one of the drawbacks of the conventional methods is that there is no financial theory to support them
2020-0433,5,"in this paper, a novel ranking method to discover expert traders based on the portfolio theory, is proposed"
2020-0433,6,the experimental results obtained with a real dataset demonstrate that this method is superior to conventional methods
2020-0433,7,"in addition, the discovered expert traders can be enlisted to develop better portfolio constructions for any given risk level"
2020-0434,0,"in recent years, thai policymakers have adopted laws aimed at keeping pace with contemporary technological developments"
2020-0434,1,"this can be seen from the issuance of a number of legislative measures regulating innovative products and services that cannot be effectively dealt with under existing laws and regulations, including those related to financial services"
2020-0434,2,"more specifically, thailand 4.0 has been presented by the government as a policy to transform thailand into a more innovation-driven or technology-driven economy"
2020-0434,3,"in accordance with the policy, there is an agenda to develop a technology cluster and future industries which are related to digital, internet of things (lot), artificial intelligence, and embedded technologies"
2020-0434,4,"the aim is that by using digital tools and iot as platforms, it will be possible to enhance productivity, quality, and innovation in various economic activities"
2020-0434,5,this can be considered as an important step for thailand in responding to the rapid development of innovation and technology in various sectors
2020-0434,6,"this chapter reviews these efforts, with a particular emphasis on fintech, as well as considering supplemental initiatives that might be useful to develop further the fintech ecosystem in thailand"
2020-0434,7,"finally, the chapter considers recent government efforts to intervene and strengthen industry associations as an example of soft law mechanisms in"
2020-0435,0,the development of new technologies by financial service providers is not new
2020-0435,1,"banks, for instance, have always utilized technology to improve front- and back-office operations"
2020-0435,2,"the historical significance of fintech does not derive from the use of technology per se, but the leveraging of the distinct properties of digital technologies by non-traditional actors to offer consumers a better experience of financial services"
2020-0435,3,"more specifically, the goal of overcoming friction in the user experience is here identified as the core feature driving many recent developments in a fintech context"
2020-0435,4,this chapter explores the implications of such an account for incumbent financial institutions and regulators
2020-0435,5,"from the perspective of incumbents, this new emphasis on the consumer experience requires banks and other financial institutions to organize-for-innovation"
2020-0435,6,"new capacities and a shift in mindset are needed to deliver a different kind of user experience, and two effective strategies for incumbents are explored"
2020-0435,7,"first, adopting more decentralized forms of organization and governancewhat we refer to as decentralized ecosystemsthat are better placed to innovate and overcome friction"
2020-0435,8,"second, adopting a more strategic approach to venturing, i.e., purchasing start-ups from the fintech sector and integrating their innovations into incumbent operations"
2020-0435,9,"from a regulatory perspective, this requires a greater willingness on the part of regulators and other policymakers to foster experimentation in financial services"
2020-0435,10,"as such, the goal of regulation needs to shift from a traditional focus on managing systemic risk to more dynamic models that seek to facilitate responsible innovation and the delivery of a better-quality user experience"
2020-0435,11,"this can be achieved, for example, by state regulators working togetherpartneringwith incumbents and start-ups in the financial service ecosystems of the future via regulatory sandboxes and other similar schemes"
2020-0435,12,regulatory developments in asia and europe provide some evidence that policymakers recognize the need for such a shift in emphasis
2020-0435,13,"however, doubts remain about whether they have gone far enough in pursuing this goal and that the full benefits of the fintech revolution have been realized"
2020-0283,0,"a regulatory sandbox is a safe space in which businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms without immediately incurring all the normal regulatory consequences of engaging in the activity in question"
2020-0283,1,"the fundamental purpose of the regulatory sandbox is to facilitate the development of fintech, especially the disruptive innovation activities of the start-up enterprises"
2020-0283,2,"in this sense, the regulatory sandbox is a sub-category of the regulation of fintech"
2020-0283,3,"fintech is technology-enabled financial innovation, synonymous with the term internet finance in the chinese context"
2020-0283,4,"a different but related term, the regulatory technology (regtech), in a broad sense refers to a combination of the compliance technology by the market players with the regulatory technology by the regulators"
2020-0283,5,"in nature, the regulatory sandbox is conditional, limited, and controlled deregulation"
2020-0283,6,"it was primarily a reaction to the somehow overly burdensome regulatory requirements after the global financial crisis (gfc), thus leaving a lifeline for financial innovation and, in particular, fintech"
2020-0283,7,"the situation is very different in china, where the major problem for internet finance it not over-regulation but under-regulation"
2020-0283,8,"with a vast territory, diversified areas, and numerous institutions, china does not feature a much developed and high concentrated financial market like that of the uk, singapore, or the hk sar"
2020-0283,9,nor does it have an integrated financial regulatory system
2020-0283,10,"and, most importantly, the existing mechanisms in china are capable of performing equivalent or even more functions than the sandbox, which, if copied in china, would be redundant"
2020-0283,11,"in short, the regulatory sandbox is admittedly a remarkable innovation in terms of regulatory ideas and approaches conducive to financial innovation, especially fintech"
2020-0283,12,"however, with its specific background, exterior conditions, and intrinsic limitations, it is by no means an inevitable choice or universal model for the regulation of fintech"
2020-0283,13,"based on the actual circumstances, its not desirable for china to introduce the sandbox, at least for the time being"
2020-0293,0,this chapter introduces the problem of horizontal shareholding in the fintech sector in asia
2020-0293,1,"a great deal of the fintech debate surrounds grab and go-jek, two ridesharing platforms that are aggressively expanding their business geographically and product-wise"
2020-0293,2,"to finance the expansion, these firms rely on various investors"
2020-0293,3,these investors do often not limit their interest in these two firms but also become shareholders in firms offering the same products
2020-0293,4,"this form of shareholding, also known as horizontal shareholding, is increasingly characterizing the fintech scene in asia"
2020-0293,5,this triggers the question on how this phenomenon should be approached from a competition law perspective
2020-0293,6,horizontal shareholding indeed facilitates the flow of information between competitors or enables control over the executives of competing firms
2020-0293,7,the issue is still controversial as there is disagreement on the effects of horizontal shareholding and on how competition law should be applied to the issue
2020-0293,8,"however, there is an understanding that further research is warranted"
2020-0293,9,"part of this research, this chapter argues, should not be on direct price increase due to horizontal shareholding"
2020-0293,10,the international character of the horizontal shareholding in the asian fintech sector requires a rethinking of the possible anticompetitive effects
2020-0293,11,this chapter claims that such an effect may be market division
2020-0293,12,enforcement may be a difficult issue
2020-0293,13,"however, when a merger occurs in this sector, enforcement authorities should pay close attention to the issue of horizontal shareholding"
2020-0436,0,fintech has been a buzzword in japan since 2015
2020-0436,1,"the fintech business model in japan is similar as in other countries: crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, blockchain, ai, big data, and cashless payments"
2020-0436,2,"what has been the largest impact of fintech in japan? at first glance, fintech seems to require a change in the financial regulation framework, but this is not the case"
2020-0436,3,"in japan, traditional financial regulation is piecemeal or trident, with a separate legislative framework for banking, insurance, and securities"
2020-0436,4,this framework is not unreasonable because it is designed to respond to different risks
2020-0436,5,"of course, some other new financial businesses appeared before fintech, and regulation responded to the new risk"
2020-0436,6,fintech is not a completely new business but just the unbundling of current financial businesses
2020-0436,7,"especially, payment became more independent from banking today, thanks to the fintech movement"
2020-0436,8,"therefore, regulation just for payment is required more clearly"
2020-0436,9,"currently, the fsa is planning to create a new category of regulation for it"
2020-0436,10,it seems fintech requires a change in the basic framework of financial law
2020-0436,11,"but both in practice and in theory, a pure payment service has attracted attention before fintech"
2020-0436,12,"therefore, fintech, or any other technological innovation, does not require a complete change of regulation but a clarification of current law"
2020-0437,0,"after the uk launched the first regulatory sandbox regime in 2016, the approach was quickly transplanted to numerous other countries as a means of promoting innovation, improving competition and enhancing financial inclusion"
2020-0437,1,"however, it remains unclear whether the approach can effectively achieve the relevant policy goals and thus justify the differential regulatory treatment"
2020-0437,2,this chapter provides a broad overview of the regulatory sandbox regime and examines its potential benefits and problems
2020-0437,3,"the chapter then provides some empirical evidence by analyzing the sandboxes awarded in the uk and singapore between 2016 and 2018 with the aim of identifying what the businesses awarded the sandboxes are doing, the services they provide and their current regulatory status against the backdrop of the financial technology revolution"
2020-0437,4,these cases provide a basis on which to assess the effectiveness of the regulatory sandbox approach in its infancy stage and provide some reflections for regulators
2020-0438,0,"after reviewing the financial regulatory system and market structure in korea, this chapter examines the recent development of fintech in the area of banking, capital markets, and payment services"
2020-0438,1,"in the banking sector, the main focus is on the development of internet-only banking"
2020-0438,2,"under the strict regulations on the separation of financial capital and industrial capital, technological companies entry into the banking business causes serious banking law debates"
2020-0438,3,"in capital markets, the application of the fintech model in capital markets such as equity and debt-based crowdfunding and robo-advisors is widely discussed"
2020-0438,4,easy payment & remittance and crypto-assets are a concern for both legal practitioners and the business sector
2020-0438,5,the legal character and function of crypto-assets is also a significant issue in korea
2020-0438,6,"in korea, institutional efforts to introduce new financial products and services in accordance with the combination of technology and finance are being developed in various fields such as banking and securities"
2020-0438,7,particularly noteworthy is the introduction of new means of payment
2020-0438,8,"the regulatory sandbox newly introduced by korea will have an impact on the korean financial regulatory system, which has traditionally been very conservative"
2020-0438,9,this chapter is based on the law of korea as of 30 june 2019
2020-0439,0,"in the context of a fast-developing, technology-driven economy, policymakers increasingly regard regulation as an essential element in gaining a competitive edge and establishing themselves as a regional hub for technology-focused businesses"
2020-0439,1,"in the context, of fintech, for example, a number of asian jurisdictions have recently introduced regulatory reforms that aim at filling gaps in existing legislation or resolving uncertainties"
2020-0439,2,"such legal reforms are motivated by the desire to encourage the development of fintech, while also ensuring that vital public interests are adequately protected"
2020-0439,3,this book is a preliminary attempt to map some of these legal developments in an asian context via a series of case studies focused on key jurisdictions
2020-0439,4,"here, by way of introduction to the substantive chapters that follow, we briefly review the disruption of incumbents and the new opportunities that have been triggered by the emergence of fintech and summarize the chapters and regulatory reforms that different jurisdictions have introduced"
2020-0439,5,common themes across all chapters are a recognition of the importance of fintech in the future development of financial services and the importance of more flexible regulatory forms that provide the freedom for all stakeholders to bring new financial technologies to the market
2020-0440,0,"in the 4th industrial revolution, the upsurged trend of financial services of non-banking institutions and the intersection of financial services and technology have shaped fintech companies"
2020-0440,1,"such businesses have advantages in technology, deliver financial solutions with modern technologies, and provide customers with a highly accessible and streamlined path to fulfill their financial needs"
2020-0440,2,"vietnam has been considered as a potentially lucrative market for fintech as it has a young and tech-savvy population, high mobile phone and internet penetration rates, and relatively low levels of financial inclusion"
2020-0440,3,"although its fintech market is still fledgling, more than 150 companies have joined with increasing transaction volumes and high growth rates"
2020-0440,4,"they have provided customers with financial and banking services such as digital payment, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, remittance, blockchain, personal finance management, and information comparison with modern technologies, lower costs, and more straightforward procedures"
2020-0440,5,"also, the country has been making an effort to spur the development of fintech companies by setting up a fintech steering committee, preparing the national financial inclusion strategy, and cautiously seeking the best approach to regulate fintech"
2020-0440,6,this chapter examines the use of fintech to facilitate socio-economic development in vietnam and considers the appropriate regulatory framework to achieve such a goal
2020-0292,0,"this chapter examines the rise of fintech, its regulation, and the particular challenges these present for an international financial center (ifc), specifically an ifc with limited economic breadth"
2020-0292,1,"fintech offers automation opportunities for financial institutions, and such automation will in most cases make banks more competitive and lower their labor needs"
2020-0292,2,"the hong kong government has actively embraced fintech to ensure competitiveness, and its regulation tracks leading international positions on icos, cryptocurrency and electronic payment"
2020-0292,3,"however, hong kong regulators have not facilitated fintech activities that would stimulate the local economy, such as equity crowdfunding"
2020-0292,4,"automation will generally translate into a reduction of human labor, particularly in mid-level jobs"
2020-0292,5,"in a large and varied economy, persons laid off from jobs at banks can seek engagement elsewhere"
2020-0292,6,this is not necessarily true in an ifc with a less diversified economy
2020-0292,7,hong kong presents the highly unusual case of persons in a small ifc who have access to a large and diverse economy in mainland china yet may refuse to seek new positions in the larger workplace for cultural or political reasons
2020-0292,8,"the hong kong government has blithely followed a market leads, government facilitates philosophy of laissez-faire for decades and thus also has failed to prepare for the social costs of fintech"
2020-0292,9,"while such preparation would indeed constitute social planning, an activity generally discouraged in hong kong, circumstances dictate that the hksar government begin to act socially, rather than merely facilitate the largest businesses"
2020-0441,0,the research objective is to study procedures of establishing experimental legal regimes in the russian federation
2020-0441,1,"the research methodology is based on applying formal logical methods, methods of systematic and structural analysis as well as comparative legal method, legal prediction and legal rule interpretation methods"

2020-0168,1,"as the evolution of fintech has laid the foundation for the next generation of technical innovation in the financial service sectors, this chapter discusses examples of fintech innovation and analyzes their opportunities as well as their ecological, societal, and technological risks from consumer and retail investor perspectives"
2020-0168,2,"while fintech innovation has the potential to make financial services easier, cheaper, and better available, all payment and investment services discussed in this chapter have in common the technological risks arising from the possibility to (mis)use consumers and retail investors data for price discrimination or identity theft"
2020-0168,3,"cryptocurrencies additionally pose ecological risks due to their enormous energy demand, while the new investment services may help retail investors to decrease the ecological risk of their portfolios"
2020-0168,4,"the societal risks of fintech overlap or coincide with the technological risks, for example, when consumer data is used to discriminate groups of consumers"
2020-0168,5,"in addition, the high degree of anonymity in cryptocurrency networks and the lack of centralized supervision can provide an ideal playing field for criminal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion that threaten consumer and retail investor welfare"

2020-0157,5,"furthermore, we explain what security risks appear within the cordapp"
2020-0137,0,this study highlights the time dimension as a key success factor for fundraising with initial coin offerings (icos)
2020-0137,1,"previous literature suggests various company- or ico-specific determinants for a successful ico, such as a professional white paper helping to establish trust among investors"
2020-0137,2,"alternatively, our empirical results suggest that lucky timing is the crucial factor in explaining ico success in terms of total amount raised"
2020-0137,3,our additional analysis considering google search activity shows that the highlighted time variation in ico success can be explained to a large degree by the respective public hype regarding icos
2020-0061,0,"in today's financial industry, fintech (financial technology) has showed its role of an innovation-driving area, which can bring outstanding changes to the traditional financial market"
2020-0061,1,this article will briefly introduce fintech as well as its development in vietnam

2020-0442,6,the security factor and users trust are still lacking to support the acceptance of e-wallet technology
2020-0291,0,"most financial literacy (fl) measurements focus on savings and investments decisions, as it is geared towards retirement planning"
2020-0291,1,"consequently, most adults around the world are classified as financial illiterate (fi)"
2020-0291,2,billions of individuals belonging to low-income populations (lips) do not have the means to plan for retirement
2020-0291,3,"regardless, they are often measured through the same fl measurements (flms) and classified as fis"
2020-0291,4,"lips are not necessarily incapable of making financial decisions, but flms do not necessarily fit their context, making it an inappropriate measurement"
2020-0291,5,"moreover, fintech is increasing the financial options that lips have"
2020-0291,6,it is thus relevant to create an appropriate measurement that addresses this inadequacy
2020-0291,7,this paper is a first step towards the creation of a measurement called financial awareness that is geared towards lips who access financial services (fs) through information communication technologies (icts)
2020-0443,0,"initial coin offerings (icos), a novel fundraising form, allow blockchain-based ventures to issue crypto-assets in exchange for enormous amount of fund, with mere ideas in the conception stage, while without constraints of intermediaries or regulations"
2020-0443,1,"in this study, we develop a theoretical framework for how campaign profile, product quality, venture team characteristics, and expert ratings interrelate"
2020-0443,2,"specifically, by establishing token sales as the primary ico success measure, informational factors and the moderating role of expert ratings are proposed to investigate the underlying determinants affecting blockchain-based fundraising"
2020-0443,3,"by analyzing a dataset that consists of 4,183 icos from 2015 to 2020, we strive to clarify whether the investors should place more weight on the company (the horse), on the venture team (the jockey), or on the expert ratings (the tips)"
2020-0443,4,"the research could promote the theoretical understanding of factors influencing icos, and help investors and entrepreneurs better appreciate the blockchain-based technology innovation"
2020-0444,0,"introduction with the introduction of the sustainable development goals (sdgs), perhaps the most important questions on the minds of most policymakers is whether the millennium development goals (mdgs) were successful and what factors may have influenced their achievement"
2020-0444,1,answering these questions is important for assessing the ongoing progress of the sdgs and identifying key policy areas to focus on

2020-0446,0,"in light of the strategic role of financial information for law enforcement, the protection of privacy regarding financial data must be balanced with the advantages of automated mechanisms for the monitoring and recording of financial activities"
2020-0446,1,"the growing availability of financial data and the global dimension of financial networks, however, impose to carefully examine practices concerning the management of financial data, checking them against the core rules and principles of data protection"
2020-0446,2,this paper steers this effort providing a framework for understanding privacy in the financial context
2020-0446,3,"moreover, it overviews the relevant legal frameworks affecting the management of financial information and assesses concrete industry practices to expose some compelling privacy issues"
2020-0446,4,the study suggests that further research is needed to establish (1) whether current practices in the financial industry determine a lack of legal protection with regard to users privacy
2020-0446,5,(2) whether it is desirable to develop technological solutions that allow a greater degree of anonymity for digital financial transactions
2020-0446,6,"and, if so, (3) which is the most suitable governance/legal and institutional framework for anonymous digital transactions"
2020-0128,0,"in this article, we propose a visualization approach that presents the users cognitive and emotional states in conjunction with the actual journey of the user on a web interface"
2020-0128,1,"specifically, we have designed a new visualization method which contextualizes the users physiological and behavioral data while interacting with a web-based information system in the financial services industry"
2020-0128,2,the proposed approach brings together the users behavior with his/her cognitive and emotional states to produce a rich overview of his/her experience
2020-0128,3,combining these methods produces key insights into the user experience and facilitates an understanding of the evolution of the experience since it highlights where the user was on the interface when s/he experienced a given cognitive and emotional state
2020-0128,4,results from an illustrative case suggest that the proposed visualization method is useful in conveying where participants deviate from the optimal path and facilitates the identification of usability issues on web interfaces
2020-0447,0,"a bill of exchange (boe) is a paper-written contract involving three parties a, b and c where a is economically in debt with b and in credit with c"
2020-0447,1,"once the parties approve a boe, c is legally bound to pay b on behalf of a within a set deadline, so that the debt of a towards b is extinguished"
2020-0447,2,"although regarded as an elegant and powerful variant of a promissory note, over time the boe has become unpractical to use in a global market where suppliers and customers arent next-door companies anymore"
2020-0447,3,"on the other hand, the blockchain distributed ledger, aes authentication, and digital archiving with suitable long-period standards (e.g., pdf/a) may encourage the revival of such an instrument, while ensuring legal validity, strength and a non-tampering warranty"
2020-0447,4,this paper exploits said state-of-the-art technologies to bring the paper-based boe into the digital era as the digiboe

2020-0290,0,the existence of non-inclusive households significantly reduces the effect of the interest rate change policy on households inter-temporal consumption decisions
2020-0290,1,"further, financial inclusion is closely related to fintech"
2020-0290,2,"on the one hand, fintech helps overcome the financial inclusion problem because fintech manages to reach those who were previ-ously inaccessible by banks"
2020-0290,3,"on the other hand, fintech will change the payment system structure in an economy that will eventually affect the effectiveness of monetary policy"
2020-0290,4,"using the vector error correction model (vecm) with the observa-tion period of 20092018, this study aims to analyze the effects of financial inclusion and fintech on effectiveness of the indonesian monetary policy within the framework of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy through interest rate channel with both the cost of capital effect and the substitution effect"
2020-0290,5,"the results demonstrate that financial inclusion level affects inflation rate as a proxy of effectiveness of the indonesian monetary policy, both in the short run and long run"
2020-0290,6,"however, the effect of shocks in financial inclusion on inflation is not permanent"
2020-0290,7,"meanwhile, fintech only affects inflation rate in the short run"
2020-0290,8,"however, shocks in fintech affect the volatility of inflation rate is permanent both through the substitution effect and the cost of capital effect"
2020-0448,0,"how much do you really know about money? everyone uses it, but few know how it really works"
2020-0448,1,most books about money focus on specific aspects
2020-0448,2,this book breaks through the usual silos to present money as a broad social technology that serves the current needs of society
2020-0448,3,"it reviews the latest developments in financial technology including cryptocurrency, blockchain, and the prospect of a cashless future"
2020-0448,4,and clears up many misconceptions in the process

2020-0171,0,we investigate borrower and lender behaviours when the borrower has experienced a sequence of failed loan applications
2020-0171,1,our analysis is based on half a million observations from an established peer-to-peer (p2p) loan platform in china from 2010 to 2018
2020-0171,2,we find that borrowers who have better credit scores and who accept to pay higher interest rates are likely to reapply for funds after experiencing an earlier failed attempt
2020-0171,3,"however, women and applicants with more education are discouraged from re-applying compared to their male or less-educated counterparts, respectively"
2020-0171,4,"on the funding supply side, lenders strive to fund safe borrowers who have high credit ratings and high income, though not those who offer a high interest rate"
2020-0449,0,regulating cryptocurrency is a difficult task for regulators
2020-0449,1,"at present, there is no clear and authoritative definition of cryptocurrency"
2020-0449,2,"making it difficult for regulators to determine which aspects require regulation and, if so, how to control and monitor activities"
2020-0449,3,defining the legal nature of cryptocurrencies is important
2020-0449,4,at its most fundamental level the answer to these matters will determine the regulatory framework within which trading in cryptocurrencies may or may not occur
2020-0449,5,"the government may simply prohibit trading in cryptocurrencies, even making such transactions illegal"
2020-0449,6,"alternatively, trading may not only be legal, but facilitated by government concessions"
2020-0449,7,a government may recognise cryptocurrencies as 'currency'
2020-0449,8,"it may be determined that transactions involving cryptocurrencies merely involve the sale of property, possibly akin to a financial product"
2020-0449,9,this article discusses the different approaches to regulating cryptocurrency and the taxation implications in four asian countries which account for a large proportion of cryptocurrency transactions
2020-0289,0,this article examines potential consumer harm that may arise due to regulating modern financial services communication technology with rules written in the early 20th century
2020-0289,1,"it is argued that disparities in record keeping regulation across communication mediums disincentivizes the use of technology capable of generating records for consumer retention, while incentivizing the use of technology which shields financial advisors from accountability"
2020-0289,2,experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument
2020-0289,3,"further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm"
2020-0289,4,"objections to these arguments are considered, along with practical guidance for consumers, regulators, and policy makers"
2020-0091,0,this study used data from the 2015 national financial capability study to analyze the adoption of mobile payments by u.s
2020-0091,1,households
2020-0091,2,"while 24% of respondents used mobile payments, the mean rate for those under age 25 was 11 times the rate for those 65 and older"
2020-0091,3,"state rates ranged from about 9% in montana to 34% in washington, dc"
2020-0091,4,"based on a logistic regression, age and an objective financial knowledge score were negatively while risk tolerance and a subjective financial knowledge score were positively related to mobile payment use"
2020-0091,5,"the results have implications for marketing of fintech applications for personal finance, especially in terms of the extremely low mobile payment use by older consumers"
2020-0172,0,"internet-only banks have recently emerged in the financial industry because of the rapid development of fintech, which combines information and communication technologies with finance"
2020-0172,1,this study investigated the factors affecting customers acceptance of internet-only banks in korea

2020-0153,0,this study examines the roles of internal and external search characteristics and attitudinal factors in investors' decisions to utilize robo-advisor-based platforms
2020-0153,1,"using the 2015 state-by-state national financial capability study and investor survey, this study finds that the need to free up time, higher risk tolerance, higher subjective financial knowledge, and higher amounts of investable assets were positively associated with individual investors' adoption of robo-advisors"
2020-0153,2,"additionally, the results from the interaction model indicates that individuals under 65 with a higher risk tolerance and greater perceived investment knowledge were more likely to use robo-advisors"
2020-0153,3,"implications of the key findings for scholars, practitioners, and industry leaders are included"
2020-0026,0,purpose: the crowdfunding market has experienced rapid growth in recent years
2020-0026,1,"however, not all projects are successfully financed because of information asymmetries between the founder and the providers of external finance"
2020-0026,2,"this shortfall in funding has made factors that lead to successful fundraising, a great interest to researchers"
2020-0026,3,"this study draws on the social capital theory, human capital theory and level of processing (lop) theory to predict the success of crowdfunding projects"
2020-0026,4,design/methodology/approach: a feature set is extracted and correlations between project success and features are utilized to order the features
2020-0026,5,the artificial neural network (ann) is popularly applied to analyze the dependencies of the input variables to improve the accuracy of prediction
2020-0026,6,"however, the problem of overfitting may exist in such neural networks"
2020-0026,7,this study proposes a neural network method based on ensemble machine learning and dropout methods to generate several neural networks for preventing the problem of overfitting
2020-0026,8,four machine learning techniques are applied and compared for prediction performance
2020-0026,9,"findings: this study shows that the success of crowdfunding projects can be predicted by measuring and analyzing big data of social media activity, human capital of funders and online project presentation"
2020-0026,10,the ensemble neural network method achieves highest accuracy
2020-0026,11,the investments rose from early projects and another platform by the funder serve as credible indicators for later investors
2020-0026,12,practical implications: the managerial implication of this study is that the project founders and investors can apply the proposed model to predict the success of crowdfunding projects
2020-0026,13,this study also identifies the most influential features that affect fundraising outcomes
2020-0026,14,the project funders can use these features to increase the successful opportunities of crowdfunding project
2020-0026,15,originality/value: this study contributes to apply a new machine learning modeling method to extract features from activity data of crowdfunding platforms and predict crowdfunding project success
2020-0026,16,"in addition, it contributes to the research on the deployment of social capital, human capital and online presentation strategies in a crowdfunding context as well as offers practical implications for project funders and investors"
2020-0450,0,the development of p2p lending fintech in indonesia is increasingly unstoppable
2020-0450,1,there is ease of digital unsecured loans and fast process due to online-based credit applications
2020-0450,2,"however, these facilities are followed by high-interest loans"
2020-0450,3,it is not in accordance with the real spirit of fintech that supposed to be to create economic efficiency by cutting high transaction costs in the conventional financial system
2020-0450,4,"in turn, people in many household sectors apply for digital unsecured loans without considering risk"
2020-0450,5,this phenomenon has to increase potential bad loans in the household sector
2020-0450,6,"finally, it will disrupt the stability of financial system as a whole"
2020-0450,7,this research aims to conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of digital unsecured loans and the dti ratio on changes in risk-taking behavior of the household sectors
2020-0450,8,research data collection was carried out through 2  2 between-subjects experimental methods
2020-0450,9,experiments were carried out using paper and pencil tests
2020-0450,10,the experimental task given is a simulation of short-term credit applications
2020-0450,11,"anova test results show that the presence of digital unsecured loans increases the household sector risk-taking behavior, the dti ratio can be used as an individual internal control to prevent increased risk-taking behavior in the digital era"
2020-0288,0,"recently, in response to the credit crunch and the increased costs of financing, new solutions for supporting the financial management of supply chains, known as supply chain finance (scf), have been developed"
2020-0288,1,the purpose of this research is to analyze how the dispute raised from the situations faced by people who involved in fintech peer to peer lending can be solved in fairness
2020-0288,2,"the methodology used in this research are statute approach, conceptual approach, and comparison dispute settlement among australia and indonesia through law case study"
2020-0288,3,"according to the indonesian law as it is stated in bw (civil code for indonesia), companies can settle their loan disputes by filing a lawsuit to the district court"
2020-0288,4,"this method is less effective because it is time consuming and costly, while it is not worth with the nominal value of the loan which is not that much"
2020-0288,5,"this situation leads to a demand of a faster, simpler and low-cost solution that can be accessed online"
2020-0288,6,this method is called as small claim court method
2020-0288,7,this method is considerably new and basically is a simplified procedure of the existing dispute settlement
2020-0288,8,a strong note on this method is its weakness when the disputes happen cross-border
2020-0288,9,this aspect needs to be improved in many ways considering the current method is only applicable when the parties have the same judicial territory
2020-0288,10,"hopefully, the information technology strongly supports the task of the judiciary in order to enforce law and legal justice through the application of electronic court (e-court) which is in line with the principle of simple, fast and low cost of justice"
2020-0288,11,"vice versa, fintech lending dispute resolution requires procedural law that can compensate for the technology that is developing rapidly"
2020-0288,12,"the information technology management referred to information management policies, institutional information management institutional arrangements, and electronic system structuring at the supreme court"
2020-0287,0,"over the last decade, fintechbroadly defined as the use of new technologies to compete in the marketplace of financial institutions and intermediarieshas disrupted the financial services sector"
2020-0287,1,"here, we revisit the question of how banks and regulators can best respond to this disruption"
2020-0287,2,we argue that incumbent financial service providers can learn useful lessons from the experience of the most innovative companies in the world and their efforts to navigate the new realities of doing business in a networked age
2020-0287,3,one of the striking features of successful large businesses with an established track record for sustained high performance has been their capacity to reinvent themselves as what we characterise as innovation ecosystems
2020-0287,4,"a key element of an ecosystemstyle organisation has been the implementation of effective corporate venturing strategies that feed dynamic, technology-driven innovation (what has been termed borrowing the start-up genies magic)"
2020-0287,5,"here, we identify seven corporate venturing strategies adopted by the most innovative companies in the world and argue that incumbent banks and other financial service providers could utilise similar strategies in responding to fintech"
2020-0287,6,"a crucial element of these strategies is a recognition of the value of co-creation, namely an inclusive, collaborative partnering between incumbents and non-traditional market players"
2020-0287,7,"to implement this objective effectively, incumbents need to absorb the energy, skills, and resources of the most dynamic start-ups"
2020-0287,8,we argue that some banks are already moving in this direction and that this trend towards the unbundling of incumbents is likely to continue
2020-0287,9,"we conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of such an account for regulators and regulatory design, more generally"
2020-0287,10,"in order to establish an environment for successful and sustainable ecosystems, regulators need to become active participants in these more open forms of business organisation"
2020-0287,11,we characterise this regulatory approach as community-driven regulatory design and identify some key issues with such a regulatory strategy
2020-0451,0,"in the modern era of the popularity of mobile phones and mobile services, the basic requirements of peoples lives can be processed through the screen that these needs are more closely linked to online and offline for mobile payment services"
2020-0451,1,"this study explores the formation of a commitment-trust relationship between users and mobile payment services in the perspective of relationship commitment and trust, and moreover, further, observe whether the committed3f relationship and trust affect the loyalty performance and customer stickiness of user"
2020-0036,0,"although theory suggests that financial market imperfectionsmainly information asymmetries, market segmentation and transaction costsprevent poor people from escaping poverty by limiting their access to formal financial services, new financial technologies (fintech) are seen as key enablers of financial inclusion"
2020-0036,1,"indeed, the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development (un-2030-asd) and the g20 high-level principles for digital financial inclusion (g20-hlp-dfi) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of fintech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality"
2020-0036,2,"this paper investigates the interrelationship between fintech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the global findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017"
2020-0036,3,we posit that fintech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion
2020-0036,4,we invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality
2020-0036,5,we uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which fintech reduces income inequality
2020-0036,6,"we also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries"
2020-0036,7,"overall, our results support the aspirations of the un-2030-asd and g20-hlp-dfi"
2020-0036,8,highlights harnessing the potential of fintech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality has been proposed by the un and g20
2020-0036,9,we posit that fintech affects income inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion
2020-0036,10,we invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether the effects of fintech differ across countries with different levels of income inequality
2020-0036,11,"we find that financial inclusion is a key channel through which fintech reduces income inequality, at all quantile levels, primarily among higher-income countries"
2020-0113,0,"we investigate how the emergence of fintech start-ups and their financing is shaped by regional knowledge creation and lack of trust in financial services incumbents across 21 oecd countries, 226 regions and over the 20072014 period"
2020-0113,1,we find that knowledge generated in the it sector is much more salient for fostering new fintech start-ups than knowledge generated in the financial services sector
2020-0113,2,"additionally, the importance of new knowledge created in the financial services sector (it sector) increases (decreases) as fintech start-ups grow and seek financing"
2020-0113,3,"when the level of trust in financial services incumbents falls within a region, this is followed by an increase in the financing provided to fintech start-ups"
2020-0113,4,"nevertheless, regions with historically low average levels of trust in financial services incumbents attract less fintech investment overall"
2020-0452,0,the aim of this research is to examine the extent to which mobile money has improved the financial inclusion of nairobis urban poor
2020-0452,1,"nairobi is kenyas largest and most developed city, but it is also the city where the countrys largest slum is located"
2020-0452,2,"the citys poorest strata, the so-called urban poor, account for a large proportion of nairobis population"
2020-0452,3,most of them face exclusion from accessing formal financial services
2020-0452,4,"however, mobile money has enabled them to access financial services more easily"
2020-0452,5,"based on survey research conducted by the author in nairobi, this paper demonstrates that the urban poor were far less likely to have a bank account than middle- and high-income groups, but that they had a high need for saving services/safe money storage"
2020-0452,6,mobile money has provided a savings service that is better suited to the needs of the urban poor than that offered by other channels and has enabled them to save small amount of money more frequently
2020-0452,7,this has encouraged greater use of mobile money and has significantly decreased levels of financial exclusion amongst the urban poor (p <.001)
2020-0453,0,the aim of the work was to identify the impact of modern financial technologies (fintech) on the institutional structure of the russian banking system
2020-0453,1,the paper used a qualitative analysis of the development of fintech in the banking system of russia
2020-0453,2,"the active participation of the state was revealed (including the bank of russia), the creation of associations and joint business projects, the growth in fintech financing, primarily by large russian banks, the transition of large russian banks to the use of new business models and the production of new banking services, increased sales personalization banking services, reducing risks in banking and increasing its productivity, reducing both banks and their branches"
2020-0453,3,the use of the multiple regression apparatus made it possible to identify an inversely proportional dependence of the number of internal structural units of russian credit organizations on the volume of payment orders received via the internet and using subscriber mobile communication devices
2020-0453,4,the multiple regression equation allows us to predict the dynamics of structural units of russian credit organizations
2020-0453,5,"it is concluded that with the development of fintech, the number of structural divisions and the number of traditional jobs of bank employees are sharply reduced"
2020-0453,6,"at the same time, the demand for fintech specialists is increasing"
2020-0454,0,"everybody likes to make a good prediction, in particular, when some sort of personal investment is involved in terms of finance, energy or time"
2020-0454,1,the difficulty is to make a prediction that optimises the reward obtained from the original contribution
2020-0454,2,this is even more important when investments are the core service offered by a business or pension fund generated by monthly contributions
2020-0454,3,"the complexity of finance is that the human predictor may have other interests or bias than the human investor, the trust between predictor and investor will never be completely established as the investor will never know if the predictor has generated, intentionally or unintentionally, the optimum possible reward"
2020-0454,4,"this paper presents the random neural network in recurrent configuration that makes predictions on time series data, specifically, prices"
2020-0454,5,the biological model inspired by the brain structure and neural interconnections makes predictions entirely on previous data from the time series rather than predictions based on several uncorrelated inputs
2020-0454,6,"the model is validated against the property, stock and fintech market: 1) uk property prices, 2) stock markets indice prices, 3) cryptocurrency prices"
2020-0454,7,experimental results show that the proposed method makes accurate predictions on different investment portfolios
2020-0455,0,"in the last two decades, the world has seen a rapid growth of large technology companies, whose business model is to provide direct interaction between multiple users, as well as providing services based on large amounts of information about potential and existing customers, generation and accumulation of data on various categories of consumers, the use of network effects"
2020-0455,1,"the introduction of new technologies has allowed technology companies, far from the financial services market, to make payments and settlements with their customers, to provide services for capital management, insurance and lending"
2020-0455,2,"until now, banks have played a dominant role in the financial services market, but with the development of electronic and information technologies, large technology companies are able to compete with them"
2020-0455,3,"technology companies have certain advantages over banks, as can provide services at the expense of lower cost, as well as to develop business in the poorest areas, where banks work unprofitable"
2020-0455,4,"new technology companies are beginning to introduce business based on big data platforms and technology, which implies the need to change risk management approaches"
2020-0455,5,"technology companies can effectively assess the creditworthiness of borrowers on the basis of large amounts of information, reducing the need to use collateral as collateral for transactions"
2020-0455,6,"at the same time, technology companies can introduce new types of risks to the financial market, as they are not involved in standard refinancing procedures and only formally comply with consumer protection rules"
2020-0455,7,"the activities of commercial banks to date are strictly regulated, so it is more difficult for them to adjust to the platform version of doing business"
2020-0456,0,"artificial intelligence offers peculiar development prospects in the field of electronic commerce, on-line banking and financial services: this is a typical event of fintech, a phenomenon considered a driving force for progress and promoting the capital market union (primary goal of the european union)"
2020-0456,1,"in particular, the field of automation of financial advice has considerable relevance: the robo-advice and its subspecies (pure, mixed, robo for advisors) allow us to ask ourselves about the qualification of the existing relationship and that involves the investor, on the remedies available to him/her in the event of relationship disorders and liability profiles"
2020-0456,2,"this last aspect presents an element of complication due to the new factors introduced by the ai in the structure of the relationship, no longer simplified as direct and exclusive between two human beings"
2020-0456,3,"it is therefore necessary to investigate the possible development guidelines and to ask whether there is already, in the current legal system, an adequate regulatory framework or whether, alternatively, a direct intervention by the legislator is necessary"
2020-0456,4,we could have: new interests on which to ask oneself about their legal recognition
2020-0456,5,or ways for a better pursuit of the already recognized interests thanks to new technologies
2020-0456,6,"or again, the needs for regulatory intervention aimed to set up new cases of better protection of the same interests"
2020-0174,0,"inexperienced individual investors are the main players in the emerging fintech industry, and also suffer from frequent negative events in the markets"

2020-0174,2,"we find that individual investors only have a significant negative reaction to moral hazard exposure events such as platforms absconding, with relatively ignorance of other types of negative events"
2020-0174,3,"the negative effect is rapid but short-lived, and shows differences among platforms of different background and attributes"
2020-0174,4,"by the mediation analysis, we find that public attention can be a mediator and explain the pattern of the impact that absconding events have on individual investors"
2020-0174,5,"related risk prevention, regulation, investor education issues are discussed and further suggestions are also put forward for both individual investors and regulators"

2020-0015,9,"practical implications: the study will contribute positively to the understanding of islamic fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other fintech users"
2020-0015,10,originality/value: the study believes to contribute positively to understanding of fintech based technology like cryptocurrency/blockchain from sharia perspective
2020-0464,0,"in 2015, taiwan introduced an exchange platform for equity crowdfunding called the go incubation board for startup and acceleration (gisa) which is supervised by the otc taipei exchange organization"
2020-0464,1,equity crowdfunding provides another channel for startups to access capital and allows for a new mechanism for start-up firms to establish their reputation with investors
2020-0464,2,"however, the risks to investors from equity crowdfunding are high"
2020-0464,3,"the high-risk nature of equity crowdfunding has the potential to act as a contagion, and further erode confidence in the startup capital market by retail investors--and this lingers over the gisa platform in taiwan"
2020-0464,4,"therefore, this study applies the of random forest (rf) algorithm to evaluate the market reaction for start-up firms on the gisa in taiwan"
2020-0464,5,the rf algorithm is proposed to be integrated into an ai model to forecast the market reaction to start-up firms as they get listed on the gisa equity crowdfunding platform
2020-0464,6,"the results not only fulfill the gap of detecting market reaction in equity crowdfunding, but the proposed rf model can replace the traditional statistics analytical technique to evaluate the market reaction"
2020-0464,7,in proposed model applied ai algorithms to predict the market reaction on taiwan gisa platform which can provide a useful ensemble tool for start-up firms and entrepreneurs to evaluate the degree of market reaction more efficiently before listing on the taiwan gisa platform
2020-0208,0,purpose: the aim of the paper is to develop the approach to a legal definition of fintech
2020-0208,1,"design/methodology/approach: in this paper we evolve possible approaches of fintech legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels"
2020-0208,2,"document analysis, as a form of qualitative research, was used in this study"
2020-0208,3,"findings: we found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address fintech companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and fintech operators"
2020-0208,4,"in our opinion, no specific legislation for fintech companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc"
2020-0208,5,"practical implications: the term fintech is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally"
2020-0208,6,"according to international organizations such as the imf, the world bank and the oecd, fintech offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries"
2020-0208,7,some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for fintech and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment
2020-0208,8,"originality/value: there is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of fintech among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area"
2020-0208,9,the value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of fintech by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way
2020-0282,0,one of the most recent popular financial technology business platforms is p2p lending
2020-0282,1,the ease of access and requirements in applying for loans means that p2p lending financial services are considered to provide solutions for the community
2020-0282,2,existence of p2p lending raises a number of issues for consumers privacy and data protection
2020-0282,3,this article aims to examine the arrangements for the practice of fintech services with the p2p lending platform and analyze the risk and performance of p2p lending mode
2020-0282,4,"the results showed that ineffectiveness of the implementation of p2p lending rules, especially in indonesia, is influenced by norms of substance that have not comprehensively regulated the amount of interest and the mechanism of debt collection, and communication mode of the community as consumers and business actors"
2020-0282,5,ease prioritizes convenience compared to security in financial transactions
2020-0282,6,the non-existence of rules is considered an obstacle to a technology innovation that tends to emphasize pre-business arrangements
2020-0276,0,"currently, lending fintech is proliferating"
2020-0276,1,it is because of the high financing needs of the people who have not been reached by the banks
2020-0276,2,the existence of lending fintech is getting stronger with the issuance of the financial service authority regulation number 77 of 2018 concerning information technology-based money lending and borrowing services
2020-0276,3,"until august 2019, there were 127 lending fintech registered in the financial service authority"
2020-0276,4,"unfortunately, there is still a problem concerning protecting consumers who make loan transactions with fintech companies, along with the rise of illegal fintech companies"
2020-0276,5,"therefore, this paper tries to analyze the potential development of lending fintech in indonesia, along with its opportunities and challenges"
2020-0276,6,the study of this research uses normative juridical
2020-0276,7,this paper concludes that the current regulation is still not enough in providing legal protection to consumers in conducting the transaction in lending fintech
2020-0276,8,"therefore, it is necessary to make a comprehensive regulation that regulates this so that public trust in the lending fintech company is higher"
2020-0178,0,the global economic environment had witnessed a sea change in the last few decades
2020-0178,1,there has been a progressive adoption of advanced technologies in banking and financial facilities
2020-0178,2,innovative use of these advanced technologies is being primarily driven by 'financial technology (fintech) companies'
2020-0178,3,fintech applications help financial intermediaries design new financial products and promote financial inclusion and sustainable development
2020-0178,4,brics nations have been pioneer in the adoption and usage of fintech
2020-0178,5,"in the last decade, brics have amplified their technical and financial assistance and recognized divergent ways of economic cooperation"
2020-0178,6,"also, these nations have significantly increased their weight in global gdp"
2020-0178,7,"these developments demand timely and optimal regulatory response, sometime beyond the defined contours of extant financial regulations"
2020-0178,8,"therefore, this study attempts to analyze the adoption and usage of various financial technologies in the brics nations"
2020-0178,9,"also, the study identifies the challenges faced during implementation and the future prospects"
2020-0178,10,the study also provides suggestions and remedial measures for the policy makers and regulators
2020-0465,0,"the paper deals with the issues of main directions, challenges and threats of development of the newest financial technologiesfintech, regtech and traditional financial intermediation"
2020-0465,1,"the authors analyze modern ecosystem and fintechs global trends, their influence on the transformation of principles, models and emergence of new threats of traditional financial intermediation"
2020-0465,2,the trends of fintech distribution in ukraine are considered
2020-0465,3,"the areas of activity of traditional financial intermediaries, which require the use of the latest technological tools, the possible effects of the influence of modern regulatory standards on the banking sphere are studied"
2020-0465,4,"the authors describe features of regtech application for improvement financial intermediaries risk management systems, usage of innovative regulatory technology tools that can enhance the quality and efficiency of financial institutions compliance systems as a prerequisite for increasing the protection of depositors, creditors and investors interests"
2020-0465,5,new opportunities for cooperation between traditional financial intermediaries and regtech companies are examined
2020-0465,6,post-crisis world-view changes in the formulation of targets for the use of financial innovations and fintech are substantiated
2020-0465,7,"the spectrum of potential financial stability risks posed by fintech, which requires systematic monitoring by entities providing financial stability, is determined"
2020-0051,0,the purpose of this study is to investigate the world-widesfinancial technology (fintech) educationand particularly the gulf cooperation council (gcc) practices toprovide a roadmap and suggestions towards the proper fintech education in the gcc
2020-0051,1,"therefore, we conducted an in-depth interview with 15scholars and fintech specialists from different gulf universities (i.e"
2020-0051,2,"from bahrain, saudi arabia, uae, kuwait, and oman)"
2020-0051,3,"in addition, the study used secondary data to explore the current opportunities and education of universities in the field of fintech"
2020-0051,4,"and the projects and researches in this field, which emerged with new technological developments in universities"
2020-0051,5,"websites on the financial departments of universities in the gcc, data from the national education ministry of the concerned countries were also examined.the findings reveal thatnone of the universities in the gcc is included in the top 10 leaders in fintech/crypto education"
2020-0051,6,"despite there are a sufficientnumber of finance departments and centers of research, most universities in the gcc have inappropriate education systems for preparing professional staff working in the fintech sector"
2020-0051,7,"furthermore, the training process is also not making the necessary progress for this industry to join the international race in this field"
2020-0051,8,"approaches of education are still traditional and behind the advancement of others, there is classic methods of learning and education techniques with no real connection with technology"
2020-0051,9,we conclude that each educated individual in the gcc has to think about fintech in light of the fact that it may be one of the world's most significant advancements in the near future
2020-0051,10,"further, the blockchain technology may assist us with changing the connections among schools, colleges, universities and, thusly, their relationship to society"
2020-0466,0,"this study aimed to determine the mechanism of the regulatory sandbox that had been running in the community, the indicators that were able to make the fintech organisers be able to pass the regulatory sandbox mechanism, and how the legal certainty of the financial technology organisers is in the regulatory sandbox mechanism"
2020-0466,1,the informants of this research were from the financial services authority (ojk) as the agency that supervises fintech's performance
2020-0466,2,this research used empirical juridical legal approach by examining the regulations and then proceeding with interviews
2020-0466,3,the analysis technique used was the descriptive method to explain various symptoms and facts in everyday life
2020-0466,4,"normative data from this study were from laws, journals, several regulations, and other materials, while empirical data was obtained from interviews with ojk"
2020-0466,5,"the results showed that the mechanism of the regulatory sandbox was run in accordance with the regulations of the governor board members number 19/14/padg/2017, concerning the limited testing room (regulatory sandbox) of financial technology and pojk ri number 13/pojk.02/2018, regarding digital financial innovation in the financial services sector"
2020-0466,6,"however, the existing regulations of the regulatory sandbox was considered unable to provide legal certainty for the financial technology organisers, because the applied mechanism took a long time"
2020-0466,7,"this made the objective of this mechanism application to cut the time needed for obtaining a permit for a fintech product to be launched in the market, was unable to be achieved"
2020-0466,8,"the government should provide simplifications of the implementation of this mechanism, without reducing the quality of the fintech products to be marketed"

2020-0090,0,fintech is not any new theory or a concept
2020-0090,1,but rather it is a phase which tends to bubble up every now and then as new forms of technologies revolutionize the world
2020-0090,2,fintech has been applied in various sectors
2020-0090,3,multiple scholars have investigated this phenomenon from the prism of the users in order to comprehend their perceptions of benefits and risks for using fintech: predominantly revealing that perceived benefit and perceived risks affect intention to use of fintech
2020-0090,4,and for raising awareness for fintech users
2020-0090,5,this is a review of current literature and it proposes a conceptual model viable for future empirical assessment
2020-0090,6,"also, recommendations are made in this article for future research in relation to the model and the nine propositions of this study"
2020-0467,0,"the purpose of this research is to find out and analyze more deeply about how the development of financial technology (fintech) today, how opportunities and threats of fintech to conventional commercial banks, how competitiveness of conventional commercial banks, how big is the influence of fintech opportunities on the competitiveness of conventional commercial banks, how big the influence of fintech's threat to the competitiveness of conventional commercial banks, and how much influence simultaneously the opportunities and threats of fintech to the competitiveness of conventional commercial banks"
2020-0467,1,this research uses a quantitative approach with descriptive and verification analysis
2020-0467,2,the number of research samples was 171 people with fintech service user criteria
2020-0467,3,"this study uses spss, developing, and testing hypotheses using amos statistics"
2020-0467,4,"the research data analysis technique used descriptive analysis using multiple linear regression, and the method of successive interval (msi)"
2020-0467,5,"the results of this study are listed in the t-test value column, using the  = 5% level, the results for the fintech opportunity variable can thus be stated that the fintech opportunity does not significantly affect the competitiveness of conventional banks"
2020-0467,6,"as for the threat of fintech, it can be explained that the threat of fintech has a significant effect on the competitiveness of conventional banks"
2020-0467,7,the results of the hypothesis are rejected that the threat of fintech does not significantly influence the competitiveness of conventional banks
2020-0104,0,"purpose: the purpose of this paper is to investigate the influential factors on behavioral intentions toward islamic financial technology (fintech) use in indonesia, for all types of fintech services as follows: payments, peer to peer lending and crowdfunding"
2020-0104,1,design/methodology/approach: this study adopted structural equation modeling using the partial least squares approach to test the hypotheses
2020-0104,2,"based on purposive sampling, the questionnaire was distributed through an online survey and received 1,262 responses"
2020-0104,3,"findings: the results demonstrate that the latent variables, planned behavior, acceptance model and use of technology, have a significant impact on encouraging behavioral intentions to use islamic fintech"
2020-0104,4,the acceptance model latent variable is the most influential factor
2020-0104,5,research limitations/implications: this study was conducted only in indonesia
2020-0104,6,"therefore, the results cannot be generalized to other countries"
2020-0104,7,"however, the study provides important strategic guidelines for policymakers in designing a framework to enhance the development of islamic fintech and to achieve financial inclusion"
2020-0104,8,it is suggested that future studies include samples from fintech users in different countries
2020-0104,9,originality/value: this study adds to the literature especially on the factors affecting behavioral intentions to use islamic fintech
2020-0104,10,"there are limited studies concerning this topic, especially for indonesia"
2020-0104,11,the unique feature of this study is the use of a large primary data set that covers most provinces in indonesia
2020-0104,12,"furthermore, this study focuses on three types of islamic fintech, namely, payments, peer to peer lending and crowdfunding"
2020-0179,0,there is a close logical correlation between structural reform of the financial sector and the enhancement of financial institutions' economic performance
2020-0179,1,"in the existing research, however, there are disagreements and gaps relating to the efficiency measurement of the financial system's input and output, as well as the impact of financial efficiency on the credit constraints facing the industrial sector"
2020-0179,2,"based on china's provincial panel data from 2008 to 2016, this paper measures and decomposes financial technology efficiency, and selects system equations to comprehensively test the internal and external transmission mechanism of financial technology efficiency"
2020-0179,3,"the research finds that: (1) the key to improving the efficiency of input and output of china's financial system lies in the effective absorption and utilization of financial system reform and financial technology innovation, that is, the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology"
2020-0179,4,"(2) the key to improving the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology lies in the overall reform of the economic system, including the development of the private economy, the expansion of market opening, the acceleration of service industry development, and the promotion of technological innovation"
2020-0179,5,"(3) the improvement of financial technology efficiency is the key to reducing costs, de-leveraging and increasing efficiency in the industrial sector"
2020-0179,6,it can effectively alleviate the credit constraints facing the industrial sector and promote its high-quality development
2020-0179,7,"therefore, it is necessary to promote the reform and opening up of the economic system with a view to promoting the efficiency of the financial system, rather than simply resorting to financial system reform and financial technology innovation"
2020-0281,0,purpose: the study sought to test the effect of financial technology on money demand in selected african states
2020-0281,1,"the study drew from the fact that there is significant latent demand for digital payments in many markets of sub-saharan africa, and widespread consumer acceptance of mobile-communications technology is highly encouraging"
2020-0281,2,"the study sought to examine the effect of technology, among other things, on money demand"
2020-0281,3,design/methodology/approach: the study used panel data and a gmm panel technique to analyse the study's findings
2020-0281,4,findings: results showed that all variables that captured financial technology have a negative effect with money demand (md)
2020-0281,5,both mobile subscriptions (ms) and atm (automated teller machines) have a negative relationship with money demand (md)
2020-0281,6,"practical implications: based on the results obtained in this study, the study recommended that central banks need to monitor and predict the consequences of financial innovations"
2020-0281,7,"as african states proceed with reforms of its financial sector, the stability of the demand for money would have to be reexamined and instruments of the central bank modified to ensure an effective control of money demand"
2020-0281,8,originality/value: a little has been done on the effect of technological developments on money demand in africa
2020-0281,9,an understanding of the way technological developments may positively or negatively impact on money demand may guide central banks in adopting and implementing appropriate monetary policies and actions
2020-0468,0,"agriculture is the primary occupation and the backbone of the indian economy as per the report of ficci, over 70 percent of the population in india depends on agriculture"
2020-0468,1,"indian government has been trying hard to provide financial services to the people who don't have access to these services through 'digital drive-, which was partially successful"
2020-0468,2,but still large number of rural people especially farmers depends on traditional credit system
2020-0468,3,presently to support farmer technologically agri- tech is providing services
2020-0468,4,"fin-tech provides financial service to all the sectors, but there is no impact on farming sector for providing credit facilities"
2020-0468,5,so the farmers are more dependent on the private lenders for loans with high interest rates for their farming needs
2020-0468,6,but due to this repayment of loan with high interest has become huge burden and is leading to suicides and deaths
2020-0468,7,the aim of the paper is to analyze the fin- tech in agri sector and its impact in helping the farmers to fulfill their needs to lesser their burdens
2020-0468,8,this helps farmers to overcome the situations and sustain to the changes in the market
2020-0280,0,"with the continuous development and progress of society, computers have begun to be applied in various fields, especially in the financial industry"
2020-0280,1,"however, while developing, it will also bring certain risks"
2020-0280,2,"therefore, relevant departments should actively do well"
2020-0280,3,preventive measures to effectively manage computer security risks and avoid financial risks
2020-0280,4,the purpose of this paper is to explore the role of computer security management in preventing financial technology risks
2020-0280,5,there are many kinds of financial technology risks
2020-0280,6,the role of computer security management in preventing financial technology risks is also multi-faceted
2020-0280,7,this paper studies the systemic risks of china's banking industry through internet finance
2020-0280,8,the impact of this is to explore the role of computer security management in preventing financial technology risks
2020-0280,9,"in this paper, the dynamic covar model analysis method and quantile regression method are used to construct a test model of internet finance and banking systemic risk"
2020-0280,10,"the research results show that the regression coefficient between internet finance and banking systemic risk covar is 0.933, and significant at the 1% confidence level, indicates that in the sample interval, the development of internet finance has increased the systemic risk level of the banking industry as a whole"
2020-0180,0,"purpose: the purpose of the chapter to study the features of the legal regulation of consumer protection of digital banking in the european union, usa, china and russia"
2020-0180,1,"in 2019, the internet user audience in russia amounted to 90 million people (75.4% of the countrys adult population)"
2020-0180,2,more than 50% of the european population (250 million people) and 40% of the chinese population (approximately 560 million people) use digital banking in everyday life
2020-0180,3,"therefore, the protection of the rights of consumers of digital financial services are facing governments of all countries of the world"
2020-0180,4,"design/methodology/approach: in this chapter, the authors studied and analyzed the provisions of legislation, judicial practice, the doctrines of the european union, the usa, china, and the russian federation"
2020-0180,5,findings: it is shown that the legal regulation of consumer protection of digital financial services should not be too strict and excessive
2020-0180,6,"excessive regulation causes digital financial service providers to travel to other countries where regulation is milder or absent altogether, which happened in the united states in 2018"
2020-0180,7,the government had to cancel some very tough provisions of dodd-frank 2010
2020-0180,8,"on the other hand, the comparatively lenient regulation of the distribution of digital banking services, for example in china, has led to the emergence of a number of fraudulent schemes in the field of internet banking"
2020-0180,9,"under pressure from the indignant public, the chinese government had to take urgent measures to rectify the situation originality/value: the novelty lies in the analysis of a number of regulatory acts, including: acts of the european union (regulation (eu) 2016/679 of 27 april 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data"
2020-0180,10,directive (eu) 2015/2366 on eu-wide payment services (psd2))
2020-0180,11,the usa (doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act (2010)
2020-0180,12,"economic growth, regulatory relief, and consumer protection act (2018) (egrrcpa))"
2020-0180,13,china (general rules of the civil law of china
2020-0180,14,law of consumer rights and interests
2020-0180,15,"cybersecurity law 2017) and the russian federation (law on protection of consumer rights of 07.02.1992 (as amended on march 18, 2019))"
2020-0067,0,current attention directed at ethical dimensions of data and artificial intelligence have led to increasing recognition of the need to secure and maintain public support for uses (and reuses) of peoples data
2020-0067,1,this is essential to establish a social licence for current and future practices
2020-0067,2,the notion of a social licence recognises that there can be meaningful differences between what is legally permissible and what is socially acceptable
2020-0067,3,establishing a social licence entails public engagement to build relationships of trust and ensure that practices align with public values
2020-0067,4,while the concept of the social licence is well-established in other sectors  notably in relation to extractive industries  it has only very recently begun to be discussed in relation to digital innovation and data-intensive industries
2020-0067,5,this article therefore draws on existing literature relating to the social licence in extractive industries to explore the potential approaches needed to establish a social licence for emerging data-intensive industries
2020-0067,6,"additionally, it draws on well-established literature relating to trust (from psychology and organisational science) to examine the relevance of trust, and trustworthiness, for emerging practices in data-intensive industries"
2020-0067,7,in doing so the article considers the extent to which pursuing a social licence might complement regulation and inform codes of practice to place ethical and social considerations at the heart of industry practice
2020-0067,8,we focus on one key industry: financial technology
2020-0067,9,we demonstrate the importance of combining technical and social approaches to address ethical challenges in data-intensive innovation (particularly relating to artificial intelligence) and to establish relationships of trust to underpin a social licence for financial technology
2020-0067,10,such approaches are needed across all areas and industries of data-intensive innovation to complement regulation and inform the development of ethical codes of practice
2020-0067,11,this is important to underpin culture change and to move beyond rhetorical commitments to develop best practice putting ethics at the heart of innovation
2020-0089,0,financial technology (fintech) has attracted a wide range of attention and is rapidly proliferating
2020-0089,1,as a result of its consistent growth new terms have been introduced in this domain
2020-0089,2,the term 'fintech' is one such terminology
2020-0089,3,this term is used for describing various operations that are being frequently employed in the financial technology sector
2020-0089,4,these operations are usually practiced in enterprises or organizations and provide requested services by using information technology based applications
2020-0089,5,"the term does take into account various other sensitive issues, like, security, privacy, threats, cyber-attacks, etc"
2020-0089,6,"this is important to note that the development of fintech is indebted to the mutual integration of different state of the art technologies, for example, technologies related to a mobile embedded system, mobile networks, mobile cloud computing, big data, data analytics techniques, and cloud computing etc"
2020-0089,7,"however, this technology is facing several security and privacy issues that are much needed to be addressed in order to improve the acceptability of this new technology among its users"
2020-0089,8,"in an effort to secure fintech, this article provides a comprehensive survey of fintech by reviewing the most recent as well as anticipated financial industry privacy and security issues"
2020-0089,9,"it provides a comprehensive analysis of current security issues, detection mechanisms and security solutions proposed for fintech"
2020-0089,10,"finally, it discusses future challenges to ensure the security and privacy of financial technology applications"
2020-0279,0,the paper addresses the topic of digital innovation in the insurance field and the challenges it poses for both companies and regulators
2020-0279,1,"the paper starts with showing how data-driven technologies represent a priceless resource for insurers, allowing new and revolutionary methods to classify policyholders in different merit categories according to risk"
2020-0279,2,the paper then turns to the analysis of new tools at the centre of the recent technological development (i.e
2020-0279,3,blockchain and smart contracts) and focuses on the role of big data in the insurance sector

2020-0277,0,in this paper we attempt to characterize the stability of shadow deposits in china with interest rate liberalization and fintech developments
2020-0277,1,we emphasize that shadow banks provide higher but riskier returns and such characteristics affect the stability of shadow deposits
2020-0277,2,"in our setting, the stability of shadow deposits is influenced by two offsetting effects, namely: the patience effect, which makes investors more willing to wait because of the potentially higher returns"
2020-0277,3,"and the uncertainty effect, which makes investors more likely to withdraw as a result of higher risk"
2020-0277,4,"under liberalized interest rates, the patience effect will erode and the uncertainty effect will be heightened because the post-liberalization higher return of traditional banks undermines the importance of the extra return of shadow deposits to depositors, while preserving the importance of the risk aspect"
2020-0277,5,fintech development is modeled as a reduction in the withdrawal cost that facilitates runs
2020-0277,6,this affects the stability of shadow deposits because of their wider fintech reliance
2020-0277,7,regulators should be cautious in pushing interest rate liberalization and fintech application alongside building a safety net for shadow banking
2020-0050,0,the emergence of a digital divide or a lack of internet access may hinder urbanization and adversely affect growth
2020-0050,1,"however, fintech development can help to improve the accessibility and affordability of financial services, particularly for sections of the population formerly excluded from such services"
2020-0050,2,"improved access is expected to stimulate the growth essential for promoting urbanization, possibly alleviating the negative impacts of a digital divide and creating a trickle-down effect"

2019-0016,0,"while contemporary technological disruption is increasingly conceptualized in terms of the logic and paradoxes of the digital platform economy, discussions of fintech have only engaged to a limited extent with these debatesparticularly from an economic geographic standpoint"
2019-0016,1,"here we fill this gap by proposing an adapted global financial network (gfn) framework for conceptualizing the organizational and geographic logic of the digital platform economy in finance, and applying it to examine the impact of the digital platform model on asset management"
2019-0016,2,"as we will show, asset management is being profoundly disrupted by what we dub digital asset management platformsor dampswhich encompass services including index fund and etf provision, robo-advising, and analytics and trading support"
2019-0016,3,"like other digital platforms, damps do not so much leverage technology to enhance their competitiveness within markets, as to radically restructure the market itself"
2019-0016,4,"also, like other platforms, their rise has produced a winner-take-all paradox of centralization through democratization that defies predictions of technology-enabled industry decentralization"
2019-0016,5,"however, the logic and implications of the rise of damps diverges, in other respects, from non-financial digital platforms, as finance has long possessed an informational intensity and regulatory and organizational fluidity characteristic of the digital platform economy"
2019-0016,6,"consequently, the digital platform model has mostly developed endogenously in asset management through incremental innovation by major financial firmsin a process that has reinforced the position of leading incumbent asset management centers, and above all new yorkrather than being introduced from the outside by upstart technology firms and clusters"

2019-0222,0,it this paper it has been analyzed whether and under what conditions an insurance company can accept insurance premiums and claims payments in bitcoins or other crypto currency based on a smart insurance contract
2019-0222,1,"on the one hand the question has been explored with regard to private law, especially insurance contract law"
2019-0222,2,"on the other with regard to public law, in particular financial supervisory law"
2019-0222,3,"the research for the present paper has been conducted primarily by taking into consideration the relevant legal frameworks in the european union, switzerland, uk and liechtenstein, while referring at the same time to general legal principles of public and private law, which have their validity in most other jurisdictions of common or civil law, such as for example in the us, hong kong, singapore or japan"
2019-0222,4,in legal research the classification of smart contracts as well as legal issues concerning crypto assets in general are to a large extent still unexplored today
2019-0222,5,therefore the author of the present paper will point out some key questions and main challenges within these fields of research without being able to claim providing readymade solutions

2019-0097,0,"the rise of the financial services sector in africa over the last decade or so has been phenomenal, marked by significant advances in mobile money, and growing financial inclusion and profitability"
2019-0097,1,"however, there are significant gaps in the academic literature on the sector, as most recent studies have focused on the more technical aspects of economics, banking and finance, with little attention paid to the management of financial institutions, and the strategic behavior of financial services players"
2019-0097,2,this special issue attempts to fill these gaps
2019-0097,3,"in this introductory paper, we provide an overview of three important trends or thematic areas that the papers in the special issue address: the decline of foreign banks in africa"
2019-0097,4,the rise of pan-african banks
2019-0097,5,and how frugal innovation and fintech are shaping the future of financial services in africa
2019-0097,6,we also outline three avenues for future research: historical perspectives on financial services
2019-0097,7,indigenous financial institutions
2019-0097,8,"and mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances"
2019-0126,0,this study explores impact factors that affect the adoption of digital payment systems in sub-saharan africa
2019-0126,1,"in this article, we investigate the impact factors that subject-matter experts consider most important to the success of fintech payment models"
2019-0126,2,"the data and their responses are evaluated through the lens of christensen's market-creation theory, which contends that the adoption of market-creating innovations by a mass swathe of heretofore non-consumers ""pulls"" framework conditions into place, including missing infrastructure and enabling regulation"
2019-0126,3,"then, we compare the findings with the literature and three case studies of mobile money adoption in kenya, south africa, and nigeria"
2019-0126,4,this study addresses a gap in the literature regarding the payment and money transfer segment of fintech innovations in africa using a multiple case study methodology
2019-0126,5,"we drew together information from multiple sources, including semi-structured interviews, archival data in the form of industry and regulatory reports, and observational field notes"
2019-0126,6,our findings suggest that enabling environments (kenya) do jumpstart adoption and difficult frameworks (nigeria) do evolve
2019-0126,7,"this study will help fintech innovators, academics, and policymakers to understand how technology and framework conditions impact payment business models in africa"
2019-0223,0,"in recent years, there are growing numbers of people going abroad for studying and traveling which indicates that the demand of currency exchanges is increasing"
2019-0223,1,"however, some problems are existed when we exchange currency through the banks"
2019-0223,2,"consequently, the new financial service called p2p currency exchange emerged which aims to disrupt the foreign exchange (fx) markets"
2019-0223,3,"in this paper, we propose a recommendation mechanism for p2p currency exchange which is based on social networks and analyze users' preference, similarity and location-based service"

2019-0224,1,"however, the development of financial technology (fintech) is still in the development stage or not yet stable where there are still problems with transactions using financial technology such as topup balances, failure to pay"
2019-0224,2,"therefore, this study aims to find out how security concerns passengers of usage financial technology for online transportation transaction? the research using quantitative method by using spss with correlation bi-variate function to see the relationship of passenger security concerns factor"
2019-0224,3,the research found several significant correlations factors from 202 respondents
2019-0224,4,the factors found are very important for development of fintech in the future
2019-0127,0,"data sharing has become an increasingly common procedure among financial institutions, but any organisation will most probably attempt to conceal some critical rules before exchange their information with others"
2019-0127,1,this paper concentrates on protecting sensitive rules when we assume that binary decision trees will be the models to be induced by the shared data
2019-0127,2,"the suggested heuristic hiding technique is preferred over other heuristic solutions such as output disturbance or encryption methods that restrict data usability, as the raw data itself can then more easily be offered for access by any third parties"
2019-0127,3,"in this article, we present a paradigm of using the local distortion hiding (ldh) algorithm in a real-life financial data set to hide a sensitive rule"
2019-0153,0,"as financial technologies (fintech) pioneers seek to disintermediate the world's traditional banking sector's intermediary role, new regulatory technologies (regtech) will be required to guarantee markets can be trusted, contract laws are adhered to and compliance can be verified through transparent processes"
2019-0153,1,"services computing researchers will play an important role in advancing regtech, but they must add to their repertoire additional knowledge of financial principles, an understanding of common fintech pathologies that may be exploited by bad actors, and new thinking in regard to protecting customer data across multiple legal jurisdictions and the related compliance of boundary crossing banking-related algorithms"
2019-0153,2,this paper uses supply chain finance as a use case to demonstrate details of this needed new repertoire
2019-0153,3,ten areas of goal and constraint resetting relevant to regtech software development and traditional services computing approaches are discussed
2019-0153,4,at stake is the need for services computing scholars to engage in developing some of the most critical software services of our age - those that can help to maintain and advance our market-based societies

2019-0151,3,"the cost-effective, technological innovation embraced by new fintech entrants, and adoption by existing companies recognizing the need to incorporate this innovation for their competitive survival, will transform the oligopolistic nature of the title insurance industry"
2019-0076,0,financial technology (fintech) based trading activities operate above and underground
2019-0076,1,"due to their nature, fintech products can be used within the dedicated regulatory framework or into the deep layers of the internet"
2019-0076,2,"this feature of fintech alone could potentially undermine the existing financial services regulation (fsr), the aim of which is to ensure financial stability through investor protection measures and measures protecting the integrity of the financial market"
2019-0076,3,"to this end, much of the illegal activities on the dark web have an interconnected and cross-sectorial impact on the fsrs aimsfor example, the on-going problem with stealing of personal data has implications on investor protection, often via market manipulation channels"
2019-0076,4,such considerations make it relevant to analyse the ways fintech used on the dark web could affect traditional and fintech activities in the financial sector
2019-0076,5,how strong this impact could be would probably depend on how ubiquitous fintech innovations are on the deep or dark web
2019-0076,6,"this article will argue that by definition their market presence is not only across the entire internet, but also very high in volume"
2019-0076,7,"this is all the more the case because fintechs brainchild, the cryptos, have become the go to currency for many activities outside the law"
2019-0038,0,electronically signing contracts is fundamental for e-commerce transactions
2019-0038,1,the main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange
2019-0038,2,the solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (ttp) to achieve fairness and those that do not
2019-0038,3,"in the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market"
2019-0038,4,"blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness"
2019-0038,5,"in this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain"
2019-0038,6,"our proposed protocol does not require a conventional ttp, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a ttp (computational and/or communication cost)"
2019-0038,7,"the protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation"
2019-0038,8,we demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation
2019-0038,9,"in addition, we show how ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of bitcoin"
2019-0038,10,"finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security"
2019-0031,0,an initial coin offering (ico) provides a new entrepreneurial finance approach for highly innovative blockchain ventures
2019-0031,1,"however, the information asymmetry and adverse selection is severe in the ico market"
2019-0031,2,"in this study, we focus on signals released in multiple channels in different ico stages to investigate the relations between signal processing and information asymmetry"
2019-0031,3,"referring to the multiple-channel communication theory, we characterize signal sources by their information schema, source credibility, and communication direction"
2019-0031,4,"empirical results indicate that in the crowd sale stage, high credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant influences on token sales"
2019-0031,5,"in the listing stage, low credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant effects on token trading"
2019-0031,6,"high credible and hard-interpretable signals, which deliver project fundamental information, lose their functions in both stages, causing information asymmetry in icos"
2019-0031,7,"we also find that investor comments on social media, which is a multiple-way communication channel, play the role of information surveillance for ventures voluntary disclosures"
2019-0031,8,those findings provide insights for signal processing and asset pricing in the ico market to reduce information asymmetry and have significant practical implications
2019-0060,0,cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies gained prominence in 2017 and 2018
2019-0060,1,the european union has closely observed developments but has not been proactive in regulating this new phenomenon
2019-0060,2,"in the fifth anti-money laundering directive, a definition of virtual currencies was introduced to eu law for the first time"
2019-0060,3,"reports published by the european securities and markets authority and by the european banking authority, both in 2019, provide further clarification on the approach being taken at eu level"
2019-0060,4,switzerland has been at the forefront of crypto developments
2019-0060,5,"the swiss approach to regulating the crypto world is different from the approach taken e.g., in malta and liechtenstein and may serve as an additional inspiration for eu regulators"
2019-0014,0,"cyber threat attribution identifies the source of a malicious cyber activity, which in turn informs cyber security mitigation responses and strategies"
2019-0014,1,"such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical infrastructure sectors"
2019-0014,2,"however, existing approaches generally rely on manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments"
2019-0014,3,"these attack indicators, also known as low-level indicators of compromise (iocs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution"
2019-0014,4,"cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as compared to the low-level iocs"
2019-0014,5,"to attribute cyber threats effectively, it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary's attack patterns (e.g"
2019-0014,6,"tactics, techniques and procedures - ttps, software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber kill chain"
2019-0014,7,"identification of high-level attack patterns is time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim network(s) and other resources"
2019-0014,8,"in the rare case that attack patterns are reported in cyber threat intelligence (cti) reports, the format is textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident reports prepared for human consumption (e.g"
2019-0014,9,"prepared for c-level and senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by machines"
2019-0014,10,"thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber threat attribution"
2019-0014,11,"specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (ctas) based on their attack patterns extracted from cti reports, using the distributional semantics technique of natural language processing"
2019-0014,12,"using these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on 327 cti reports collected from publicly available incident reports that cover events from may 2012 to february 2018"
2019-0014,13,it is observed that the cta profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e
2019-0014,14,"83% as compared to other publicly available cta profiles, where the precision is 33%)"
2019-0014,15,the deep learning neural network (dlnn) based classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e
2019-0014,16,94% as compared to other classifiers)
2019-0226,0,"a trend of integrating information technology (it) into the traditional financial industry has been increasing, impetus unavoidable due to the rapid development in it"
2019-0226,1,"traditional curricula of finance had been built upon the framework of classic economics, and this model started falling short providing qualified graduates to the financial workforce as the landscape changed"
2019-0226,2,"financial technology (fintech) was the response, a newborn approach designed to address the gap"
2019-0226,3,"the curricula of conventional financial subjects lacked the practicality for studies, and the link between teaching and assessment needed revisiting"
2019-0226,4,"fintech addresses the practicality and the link through carefully considering the transferability of applicable skills taught in education, industry-academia collaboration, simply meaning to prepare students with practical skills that align with needs from the industry"
2019-0226,5,this paper proposes a new curriculum model of fintech based on the integration of teaching and talent needs from the finance industry
2019-0226,6,"practice is infused into the model, to which the step of corporation assessment of practice is introduced"
2019-0226,7,"this curriculum covers three parts, which are: 1) curriculum framework, 2) creativity of curriculum structure, and 3) assessment of practice"
2019-0226,8,the subject construction and development of fintech are discussed and elaborated from the above three perspectives
2019-0226,9,curriculum development aims to create an educational environment where the needs from the industry are addressed and combined into the pedagogy
2019-0227,0,"with the advancement and development of science and technology, nowadays society is the development of information technology, cloud computing, mobile internet, internet of things, block chain and information technology.the combination of finance and technology has made financial technology terms gradually emerging."
2019-0227,1,this research analyzes the patents of financial technology
2019-0227,2,"however, taiwan's financial technology patents are mostly g06q-20 (payment plan, architecture or agreement), g06q-30 (commercial, such as marketing, shopping, payment, auction or e-commerce)"
2019-0227,3,"g06q-40 (financial, investment or tax treatment, insurance).the research use text mining technology to analyze and understand taiwan's trends and developments in financial technology"
2019-0227,4,the research results show that g06q-20 patents are biased towards information security and mobile payment
2019-0227,5,g06q-30 patents favor shopping websites and advertising
2019-0227,6,"g06q-40 patents are biased towards diversity, such as securities, insurance, finance, and stocks"
2019-0072,0,"purpose: given the large global investments made in fintechs and the context of brazilian credit (which has been suffering from the effects of the crisis in the last decade), the purpose of this paper is to study the propensity of consumption of credit services offered by fintechs of loans"
2019-0072,1,"in order to discover the factors that influenced the propensity to apply for fintech loans, a theoretical model was designed, which was tested by means of a survey given to individuals who might contract loans"
2019-0072,2,"design/methodology/approach: the final sample consisted of 507 individuals whose data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (sem), with estimation of partial least squares"
2019-0072,3,"findings: from the results of the research, it was possible to draw a profile of the fintechs of brazilian loans and also to estimate the antecedents of the propensity to utilize this type of service"
2019-0072,4,research limitations/implications: the model proposed in this work was developed to measure the propensity to consume in relation to the credit services offered by lending fintechs
2019-0072,5,"practical implications: the consumer should intensify the use of these channels to shape financial products and services to their needs, thereby democratizing access to credit, which is often restricted in quantity and quality by policies of institutions that dominate the brazilian lending market"
2019-0072,6,"originality/value: aspects such as trust, personal innovation, perceived utility, ease of use and social influence, as well as the constructs that precede them like privacy, stigma and transactional distance, explain 41.5 percent of the propensity to use services from lending fintechs in brazil"
2019-0007,0,financial technology (fintech) services using emerging technology such as the internet of things (iot) is becoming more prevalent
2019-0007,1,the recent proliferation of the mobile payment sector led by innovative mobile fintech payment services such as apple pay and samsung pay is the most important and fastest growing fintech services from consumers perspective
2019-0007,2,"although businesses have been making efforts to spread the use of the services, security is crucial in the diffusion of the services"
2019-0007,3,"despite the importance, the role of perceived security in continuous intention to use mobile, fintech services has not yet been investigated in depth"
2019-0007,4,"thus, this study investigates the relationships between perceived security, knowledge regarding the services, confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction"
2019-0007,5,we propose a research model using an extended post-acceptance model (epam) as a theoretical framework in the context of fintech services
2019-0007,6,we then validate the model using the data collected from the service users
2019-0007,7,the analyzed results show that knowledge and perceived security in mobile fintech services have a significant influence on users confirmation and perceived usefulness
2019-0007,8,"however, perceived security does not directly influence users satisfaction and continual intention to use"
2019-0007,9,"we further find significant relationships among confirmation, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and continual intention to use of the services"
2019-0007,10,we discuss theoretical and practical contributions of the study
2019-0000,0,we investigate the economic and technological determinants inducing entrepreneurs to establish ventures with the purpose of reinventing financial technology (fintech)
2019-0000,1,we find that countries witness more fintech startup formations when the economy is well-developed and venture capital is readily available
2019-0000,2,"furthermore, the number of secure internet servers, mobile telephone subscriptions, and the available labor force has a positive impact on the development of this new market segment"
2019-0000,3,"finally, the more difficult it is for companies to access loans, the higher is the number of fintech startups in a country"
2019-0000,4,"overall, the evidence suggests that fintech startup formation need not be left to chance, but active policies can influence the emergence of this new sector"
2019-0067,0,this chapter examines how fintech is breaking barriers to financial inclusion
2019-0067,1,it first traces the history of fintech and its evolution both globally and in africa
2019-0067,2,then it reviews the impact of selected fintech products in african countries
2019-0067,3,several observations are noteworthy
2019-0067,4,"first, mobile money facilitated by mobile technology stands out as the most successful innovation in extending financial inclusion in africa"
2019-0067,5,"second, the most promising innovation that has the potential to alleviate sme funding constraints is crowdfunding"
2019-0067,6,"however, this potential can only be realized by increasing internet access in africa, the region with the lowest penetration"
2019-0067,7,"finally, the chapter discusses the challenges facing the proliferation of fintech investments in africa"
2019-0027,0,purpose: this study aims to examine the adoption of peer-to-peer (p2p) lending platforms to determine the factors that encourage smes to use p2p lending platforms in obtaining loans
2019-0027,1,"design/methodology/approach: a sample of ten smes from a variety of backgrounds was taken in bandung, indonesia"
2019-0027,2,"bandung has been awarded the title of creative city by unesco, as the city allows for the development of the creative economy"
2019-0027,3,this research used a semi-structured interview
2019-0027,4,coding method was then used for content analysis to establish which factors emerging from the interview were leading respondents to obtain a loan through the p2p lending platform
2019-0027,5,"findings: the findings imply that loan processes, interest rates, loan costs, loan amounts and loan flexibility affect smes in obtaining a loan through p2p lending"
2019-0027,6,"moreover, alternative payment schemes in the form of sharia-based lending and profit-sharing schemes were found"
2019-0027,7,these findings constituted the original findings of this study
2019-0027,8,research limitations/implications: the study offers findings on factors affecting smes in using the p2p lending platform as a form of alternative financing
2019-0027,9,"moreover, the theoretical framework provided can be used as literature in future research"
2019-0027,10,"as this study was conducted in bandung, indonesia, the findings may not be generalisable to other regions"
2019-0027,11,originality/value: this study is one of the few studies that discusses p2p lending in indonesia as the concept has been in practice only since 2015
2019-0098,0,this paper investigates how to improve statistical-based credit scoring of smes involved in p2p lending
2019-0098,1,the methodology discussed in the paper is a factor network-based segmentation for credit score modeling
2019-0098,2,"the approach first constructs a network of smes where links emerge from comovement of latent factors, which allows us to segment the heterogeneous population into clusters"
2019-0098,3,we then build a credit score model for each cluster via lasso-type regularization logistic regression
2019-0098,4,"we compare our approach with the conventional logistic model by analyzing the credit score of over 1,5000 smes engaged in p2p lending services across europe"
2019-0098,5,the result reveals that credit risk modeling using our network-based segmentation achieves higher predictive performance than the conventional model
2019-0228,0,we analyzed data collected from retail investors in the chinese stock market from a fintech mobile platform to find evidence of the self-fulfilling prophecy effect
2019-0228,1,we found a statistically significant correlation between the predicted and actual shanghai stock exchange composite index (sseci) as well as non-random deviation patterns
2019-0228,2,we also analyzed participating investor behaviors and discussed the implications and future research
2019-0150,0,"in light of inevitable cross-border scenarios in today's highly interconnected financial markets and since financial stability may be put at risk by the rising phenomenon of financial technology (known as fintech), the importance of developing effective ways to regulate fintech across borders cannot be neglected"
2019-0150,1,the financial sector has changed from a traditional one marked by conventional financial intermediation structures towards an increasingly technology-affected one
2019-0150,2,"not only this change but anticipated developments too require if not extensively reconsidering the design of financial regulation,1 then at least not turning a blind eye to shaping developments"
2019-0150,3,whether the numerous recently sprouting bilateral fintech cooperation agreements are adequate transnational regulatory instruments to address fintech effectively across borders is for this paper to elucidate
2019-0023,0,fintech is the hottest topic in finance today
2019-0023,1,"recent advances in cryptography, data analytics, and machine learning are visibly ""disrupting"" traditional methods of delivering financial services and conducting financial transactions"
2019-0023,2,"less visibly, fintech is also changing the way we think about finance: it is gradually recasting our collective understanding of the financial system in normatively neutral terms of applied information science"
2019-0023,3,"by making financial transactions easier, faster, and cheaper, fintech seems to promise a micro-level ""win-win "" solution to the financial system's many ills"
2019-0023,4,"this article challenges such narratives and presents an alternative account of fintech as a systemic, macro-level phenomenon"
2019-0023,5,"grounding the analysis of evolving fintech trends in a broader institutional context, the article exposes the normative and political significance of fintech as the catalyst for a potentially decisive shift in the underlying public-private balance of powers, competencies, and roles in the financial system"
2019-0023,6,"in developing this argument, the article makes three principal scholarly contributions"
2019-0023,7,"first, it introduces the concept of the new deal settlement in finance: a fundamental political arrangement, in force for nearly a century, pursuant to which profit-seeking private actors retain control over allocating capital and generating financial risks,1 while the sovereign public bears responsibility for maintaining systemic financial stability"
2019-0023,8,"second, the article advances a novel conceptual framework for understanding the deep-seated dynamics that have eroded the new deal settlement in recent decades"
2019-0023,9,"it offers a taxonomy of core mechanisms that both (a) enable private actors to continuously synthesize tradable financial assets and scale up trading activities, and (b) undermine the public's ability to manage the resulting system-wide risks"
2019-0023,10,"finally, the article shows how and why specific fintech applications-cryptocurrencies, distributed ledger technologies, digital crowdfunding, and robo-advising-are poised to amplify the effect of these destabilizing mechanisms, and thus potentially exacerbate the tensions and imbalances in today's financial markets and the broader economy"
2019-0023,11,it is this potential that renders fintech a public policy challenge of the highest order
2019-0148,0,aim: the paper attempts to assess the fundamentals of business model and its classification
2019-0148,1,"also it explores the basics of financial innovation, emerging banking technologies and enhance rich insights from the case of innovative gojek business model"
2019-0148,2,methodology: qualitative approach is utilized to understand the fundamentals of business model from secondary sources focused on literature review

2019-0148,4,"the various enabling banking technologies of new age business models are also identified from secondary sources especially technology based journals, banking forums and related sources"
2019-0148,5,major findings: a bm is comprised of two fundamental elements namely the value proposition (what is offered and to whom) and the operation model (how do we generate profit by delivering the offering)
2019-0148,6,the hype cycle and related discussion on business processes explains in depth the various aspects of technology adoption in bms
2019-0148,7,"in the context of discussion on business modelling, financial innovation can be categorized based on innovations in product process and risk-shifting"
2019-0148,8,"hybrid cloud, api platforms, robotic process automation (rpa), blockchain, instant payments, prescriptive security, artificial intelligence (ai), augmented and virtual reality, smart machines and quantum computing are some of the latest fintech to mention in the context of banking and financial services industry"
2019-0148,9,the gojek business model is explored to comprehend the delicate aspects of business model innovation and understand the grass roots strategic approach adopted by the model
2019-0121,0,biometric security is one of the promising methods
2019-0121,1,the purpose of this study is to provide a more systematic understanding of biometric security
2019-0121,2,"this study systematically summarizes the issues related to the biometric authentication method from the viewpoint of the nonprofessional, and suggests solutions on a policy level"
2019-0121,3,the research methods were mainly based on the literature
2019-0121,4,"analysis of biometric types are being used, and there are pros and cons in each biometric type"
2019-0121,5,biometric authentication should use for authentication minimum two methods
2019-0121,6,"otherwise, each biometric method has its own vulnerability which could be attacked by malicious users"
2019-0121,7,"when developing policies, this study will be helpful"
2019-0121,8,the fact that it does not reflect the latest trends abroad and the fact that it cannot present the technical supplementary measures more professionally and directly is the limit of this study
2019-0229,0,"the rise of fintech startups and the broadening ambitions of the worlds digital titans are putting increased pressure on traditional banks, insurers, and other players"
2019-0229,1,"customers no longer expect their bank to provide the best digital experience (dx) amongst its peers, but amongst all the organizations they interact with"
2019-0229,2,"due to a plethora of data, fintech startups have gained significant grip, by introducing innovative and successfully offering products and distinctive solutions for consumer demand, efficiently and conveniently at lower transaction cost"
2019-0229,3,"in view of increased number of digitally enlighten customer and rising adoption rate of fintecc, the banks and fintech firms should not view as a rivalry to each other but as collaborative partner on the grounds of their relevance and interdependence"
2019-0229,4,"the paper discussed the rationality behind collaborations of banks with fintech startups, challenges and supportive environment"
2019-0086,0,"testing of distributed systems is a complex task, which is hampered by the impossibility of guaranteed reproduction of errors associated with race conditions"
2019-0086,1,"even minor instrumentation of the system significantly changes its characteristics, which becomes critical, especially for load testing"
2019-0086,2,all of that increases the importance of quality control methods based on the system log analysis
2019-0086,3,"in this paper, we present our experience of semi-automated analysis of the behavior of clearing and settlement system by utilizing its logs for the purpose of identifying and classifying errors"
2019-0041,0,peer-to-peer (p2p) fintech platforms allow cost reduction and service improvement in credit lending
2019-0041,1,"however, these improvements may come at the price of a worse credit risk measurement, and this can hamper lenders and endanger the stability of a financial system"
2019-0041,2,we approach the problem of credit risk for peer-to-peer (p2p) systems by presenting a latent factor-based classification technique to divide the population into major network communities in order to estimate a more efficient logistic model
2019-0041,3,"given a number of attributes that capture firm performances in a financial system, we adopt a latent position model which allow us to distinguish between communities of connected and not-connected firms based on the spatial position of the latent factors"
2019-0041,4,we show through empirical illustration that incorporating the latent factor-based classification of firms is particularly suitable as it improves the predictive performance of p2p scoring models
2019-0058,0,"this paper presents a qualitative study of the recent integration of a uk-based, digital-first mobile banking app  monzo  with the web automation service ifttt (if this then that)"

2019-0058,7,and future forms of financial autonomy
2019-0137,0,"along with the booming consumer credit market, credit scoring has received an increasing concern in auto financial companies"
2019-0137,1,"however, the modeling without rejected applicants and the imbalanced distribution of accepted examples affect the predictive performance"
2019-0137,2,"in this paper, we propose a novel framework for credit scoring using an imbalanced-learning-based reject inference"
2019-0137,3,"first, we employ an imbalanced learning for the accepted applicant data using synthetic minority over-sampling technique for reject inference"
2019-0137,4,"second, we conduct reject inference for rejected applicants based on a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm, which is called label propagation"
2019-0137,5,"third, we use tree-based ensemble learning models as base classifiers to train the combined training data"
2019-0137,6,"finally, we give an exact experiment for assessment using data from a chinese auto loan company"
2019-0137,7,"the results indicate that the proposed novel framework performs better than comparative models, which represents a progressive method for auto loan"
2019-0001,0,we provide large-scale evidence on the occurrence and value of fintech innovation
2019-0001,1,"using data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify innovations by their underlying technologies"
2019-0001,2,"we find that most fintech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable"
2019-0001,3,"for the overall financial sector, internet of things (iot), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types"
2019-0001,4,"innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect"
2019-0001,5,"(jel g14, g20, g29, g39)"
2019-0005,0,"fintech is about the introduction of new technologies into the financial sector, and it is now revolutionizing the financial industry"
2019-0005,1,"in 2017, when the academic finance community was not actively researching fintech, the editorial team of the review of financial studies launched a competition to develop research proposals focused on this topic"
2019-0005,2,this special issue is the result
2019-0005,3,"in this introductory article, we describe the recent fintech phenomenon and the novel editorial protocol employed for this special issue following the registered reports format.we discuss what we learned from the submitted proposals about the field of fintech and which ones we selected to be completed and ultimately come out in this special issue"
2019-0005,4,we also provide several observations to help guide future research in the emerging area of fintech
2019-0005,5,"(jel g00, g21, g23, g28, l51, o31)"
2019-0043,0,"using a large representative sample of retailers active in e-commerce, we find that acceptance of crypto-payments is modest (2%), but there is substantial interest among online retailers to adopt them"
2019-0043,1,"regression analysis shows that consumer demand, net transactional benefits and perceived accessibility of accepting crypto-payments influence adoption intention and actual acceptance"
2019-0043,2,our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility
2019-0043,3,the most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand
2019-0043,4,it seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future
2019-0032,0,"competition has been suppressed for extended periods in banking and when it has been unleashed, financial stability has suffered"
2019-0032,1,"this paper elucidates the relationship between competition and stability in modern banking, with particular attention to the impact of digital technologies, and derives the policy consequences for regulation and competition policy"
2019-0123,0,"as the number of devices and platforms gradually increased that serve as a medium for online banking services, the number of replicated services for different platforms also increase"
2019-0123,1,each service has a different representation in a different platform even though targeting the same business objectives
2019-0123,2,this situation results in the problem of re-developing similar set of requirements for different devices and services which in turn results in multiplied effort in software development and degradation in the software quality because of the replicated code
2019-0123,3,the objective of this paper is to present a device independent user interface development approach that eliminates the replicated user interface development effort of the same set of services for different platforms/devices while increasing the presentation performance
2019-0123,4,"in this context, we provide a basic technique that uses a json based user interface definition format, called omni-script, to separate the representation of banking services in different platforms/devices, so called channels"
2019-0123,5,"omni-script is a pioneering solution being used in a real development environment in banking software domain that is experiencing a shift towards omni-channel user experience, where users are able to seamlessly continue using banking services in different platforms and devices"
2019-0123,6,"as the evaluation method, we have measured the actual development effort on a representative sample development team and a set of services"
2019-0123,7,"additionally, we later deployed and measured the rendering time and the amount of data communication for the proposed approach in a real production environment"
2019-0123,8,production deployment resulted in a remarkable decrease in data communication and in loading times at the client side
2019-0123,9,"as importantly, the proposed approach also resulted in a nearly 75% decrease in service development time by enabling analysts to produce user interface prototypes that can be integrated to service development with minimal effort"
2019-0013,0,"with the development of the smartphone and mobile internet, a platform-based mobile payment service has emerged that can handle all banking services with a smartphone alone"
2019-0013,1,"in the meantime, many studies have been made on the analysis of new emerging financial technologies"
2019-0013,2,"however, most studies have analyzed financial technologies from the consumer perspective, and there has been no analysis of the intention to accept the financial technology in terms of retailers"
2019-0013,3,"this study analyzes the factors affecting financial technology adoption from consumer and retailer perspectives respectively, and suggests an integrated model in which each adoption influences each other's demand from the perspective of the two-sided market"
2019-0147,0,cyber black markets for hacking tools or services are gaining widespread attention as more advanced persistent threat attacks are relevant to such markets
2019-0147,1,"in july 2016, the atm heist of taiwan first bank is based on well-known carberp malware family, which is available for sharing, sale or cooperation on such markets"
2019-0147,2,"this study reviews organizational cybercrime activities and atm threats, and proposes an ict governance framework in online atm heist management"
2019-0147,3,"this framework further points out capable people, efficient process, effective technology, and data governance"
2019-0147,4,this framework is potentially useful for cybercrime prevention
2019-0070,0,"traditional payment systems have standards designed to keep transaction data secure, but blockchain systems are not in scope for such security standards"
2019-0070,1,we compare the payment application data security standards (pa-dss) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standards applicability
2019-0070,2,"by highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model"
2019-0070,3,"in two case studies, we analyze the qtum and ethereum blockchain platforms industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the pa-dss"
2019-0070,4,we determine qtums and ethereums capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards
2019-0070,5,"after adapting the pa-dss and analyzing the qtum and ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems"
2019-0070,6,"we report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the pa-dss standards results"
2019-0070,7,"finally, we discuss open research issues"
2019-0230,0,"with the development of big data and artificial intelligence, it is more and more common to apply machine learning algorithms to financial risk control"
2019-0230,1,"however, the current research work still lack the integration of prior rule knowledge and big data algorithms"
2019-0230,2,"this paper proposes a novel risk control model, which firstly uses the financial industry's prior rules to conduct risk control identification, and rapid screens data of rise that is easy to judge"
2019-0230,3,"then, we use machine learning algorithms such as svm to train and learn financial big data"
2019-0230,4,the combination of the two makes full use of prior risk control support for fast and effective data judgment and machine learning for efficient and real-time monitoring of financial dynamic changes
2019-0049,0,"this practitioner note proposes a new approach considering two-stage clustering and lrfmp model (length, recency, frequency, monetary and periodicity) simultaneously for customer segmentation and behavior analysis and applies it among the iranian fintech companies"
2019-0049,1,"in this practitioner note, the k-means clustering algorithm and lrfmp model are combined in the customer segmentation process"
2019-0049,2,"after initial clustering, for a better understanding of valuable customers, additional clustering is implemented in segments that needed further investigation"
2019-0049,3,this approach contributes to a better interpretation of different customer segments
2019-0049,4,"customer segments, consisting of 23524 business customers are analysed based on their characteristics and appropriate strategies are recommended accordingly"
2019-0049,5,the first stage clustering result shows that customers are best segmented into four groups
2019-0049,6,the first and fourth segments are clustered again and the final 11 groups of customers are determined
2019-0049,7,"this note provides a systematic and practical approach for researchers and practitioners for segmentation, interpretation, and targeting of customers especially in the b2b setting and the fintech industry and helps managers to make effective marketing strategies and enhance customer relationship and marketing intelligence"
2019-0066,0,artificial intelligence is the latest in the series of disruptions manifested by computer science
2019-0066,1,ai has been rapidly transforming the dynamics of banking and financial services industry also
2019-0066,2,"the established and emerging capabilities of ai are being combined, reconstituted and re-formulated in unexpected ways and are throwing up new opportunities and new challenges but at the same time posing new threats also"
2019-0066,3,"apart from the ethico-neutral character of technology and its attendant threats like cyber-crimes and macro-financial risks, a major question to be inquired into is its sustainability as it tends to replace humans and the related personal touch which most often is the essence of financial services industry thriving on the art of customization and customer delight"
2019-0066,4,the instant paper attempts to examine relatively under-explored perspective of ai replacing humans in the space of banking and financial services and unmindfully heralding the flight of personal touch and service customization which are the cornerstone of customer satisfaction and delight in industries like banking and financial services known for their fiduciary and responsible character
2019-0125,0,financial inclusion and inclusive growth is the clarion call given by nations all across the globe as they become increasingly aware that growth is more sustainable when it is inclusive
2019-0125,1,close on the heels of this awakening comes the fintech revolution which questions the role of traditional players in promoting the inclusion and fosters the same
2019-0125,2,"while the regulated traditional banking channel has been engaged in meeting the challenges of inclusive growth, the emergence of technology is sweeping across the sub-continent marked by stupendous growth in electronic market, smart phone penetration, cloud based solutions and the emergence of financial technology companies providing services and products similar and parallel to banking"
2019-0125,3,"even as fintech seems to redefine the service quality and product delivery through innovative use of technology in design and delivery of financial products and services, there is a need to moderate the hype by introducing a robust regulatory framework to strike a balance between innovation and compliance and to ensure a service orientation over and above the pure commercial instinct"
2019-0125,4,"the instant paper attempts to examine the phenomenal role of fintech in filling the wide gap of financial inclusion, the need for its reorientation towards poorest of the poor and the road ahead in the light of multiple challenges that it faces and poses to the traditional players"
2019-0146,0,"after demonetization on november 8th, 2016, india saw an increased use of different internet payment systems for money transfer through various devices"
2019-0146,1,npci (national payments corporation india) launched bharat interface for money (bhim) an application run on upi (unified payment interface) in december 2016 to cater the growing online payment needs
2019-0146,2,the different modes of digital payments saw a drastic change in usage in the last 2 years
2019-0146,3,"though technological innovations brought in efficiency and security in transactions, many are still unwilling to adopt and use it"
2019-0146,4,"earlier studies related to adoption, importance of internet banking and payment systems attributed it to some factors which are linked to security, ease of use and satisfaction level of customers"
2019-0146,5,the purpose of this study is to unfold some factors which have an influence on the customer satisfaction of bhim application
2019-0146,6,the study was conducted using data collected from 130 users of (prior and current users) bhim application
2019-0146,7,"the analysis gives an understanding, that factors which can influence the intensity of customer satisfaction of bhim application are speed of transaction, perceived ease of use, security and customer service"
2019-0146,8,"though all the factors are related to customer satisfaction, the intensity of relationship is stronger for speed of transaction"
2019-0052,0,"new network technologies are framed as eliminating transaction costs, a notion first developed in economic theory that now drives the design of market systems"
2019-0052,1,"however, the actual promise of the elimination of transaction costs seems unfeasible, because of a cyclical pattern in which network technologies that make that promise create processes of institutionalization that create new forms transaction costs"
2019-0052,2,"nonetheless, the promises legitimize the exemption of innovations of network technologies from critical scrutiny"
2019-0036,0,technological development and digitalization plays a crucial role in financial sector by allowing firms to create value in a rapidly changing environment
2019-0036,1,the acquisitions of firms related to financial technologies are one of the ways to obtain vital knowledge
2019-0036,2,in order to identify the fintech companies we are looking at firms that are involved in business activities in both the it and financial sectors
2019-0036,3,"by examining the growing role of fintech firms in the recent mergers and acquisitions from an investor point of view, this paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the post-acquisition performance of the acquirer firms measured by abnormal returns"
2019-0036,4,we discovered significant positive average abnormal return after acquisition of fintech companies in the short-term and negative average abnormal return in the long-term using event study methodology
2019-0036,5,"the specifics of cross-border acquisitions, the level of the domestic market development of the acquirer, and other characteristics of m&a deals are considered in order to explain the reaction of investors to announcements of fintech firms acquisitions"
2019-0036,6,the determinants of corresponding m&a deals in emerging and developed markets were revealed
2019-0120,0,the purpose of this article is to clarify an organizational continuum of a technological platform development in a japanese accounting cloud service
2019-0120,1,"the authors continuously have been studying an accounting cloud service, which adopts two-sided markets structure and freemium business model"
2019-0120,2,"as the results, the authors obtain three findings"
2019-0120,3,"first, the japanese accounting cloud service, which runs its business with regional banks in retail banking, has been exploiting its platform into partners customers"
2019-0120,4,"second, it has been building up from a supply-chain platform to an industrial platform in four years since its entrepreneurship"
2019-0120,5,"third, it has been transforming its cloud-to-cloud service connections from weak-tied interfaces to its own strong-tied interfaces"
2019-0120,6,"therefore, starting-up cloud service providers should not only utilize weak-ties to establish a structural hole, but also should develop its own strong-ties and indirect ties to tighten upon its two-sided markets structure in its cloud ecosystem"
2019-0120,7,copyright
2019-0040,0,"the pervasive adoption of outsourcing and cloud technologies proceeds apace, but the challenges and risks inherent in cloud arrangements are causing concern amongst regulators globally"
2019-0040,1,"how well prepared are financial services multinationals for regulatory compliance? cloud based fintech companies are disrupting traditional banking models, signaling that highly regulated firms must adopt cloud technologies"
2019-0040,2,"the paper focuses on understanding specific risks in relation to cloud adoption, and the regulations and penalties for non-compliance being put in place"
2019-0040,3,"from the findings, we theorize a framework for deciding when to engage strategically with, or avoid cloud technologies"
2019-0040,4,this helps executives balance the need to innovate with the need to manage compliance risk
2019-0040,5,we then detail emerging effective practices for managing cloud based innovation on a sustainable basis
2019-0040,6,"while we focus on global financial services, the analysis applies to all regulated industries, wherever cloud based innovations impact materially on business-critical services"
2019-0231,0,the recent upsurge in the role of digital and electronic money raises concern on regulatory aspects of cryptocurrencies
2019-0231,1,the need for regulation of cryptocurrencies is discussed and the regulatory challenges are emphasized
2019-0231,2,"the current regulatory and legislative practices in the us, european union (eu), japan, and china are analyzed"
2019-0231,3,the prospects for future research are identified
2019-0231,4,it is concluded that the intrinsic qualities of cryptocurrencies that exacerbates the hype about the virtual money such as bitcoin pose obstacles for the regulation and supervision of cryptocurrencies and impede further prevalence
2019-0231,5,yet it is the design of the global regulatory framework that will influence the future recognition of cryptocurrencies
2019-0232,0,"because of the popularity of smart devices and the internet, people's habits of shopping and the way they pay have changed"
2019-0232,1,"from cash payment to credit card payment, it is now possible to use smart devices to complete payment actions"
2019-0232,2,"in the field of payment, the annual output value in 2017 is as high as 720 billion dollars"
2019-0232,3,"under such high output value, it naturally attracts a large number of manufacturers to enter this field"
2019-0232,4,"in so many manufacturers, how should users choose? however, users will consider the use of electronic currency"
2019-0232,5,"directly affect the market share of each manufacturer, if you can start from the user's consideration point and implement the strategy improvement, it will definitely increase the market share"
2019-0232,6,"this study explores the user's consideration of electronic currency and the development of financial technology, and establishes a causal loop diagram of users using electronic currency with system dynamics, while simulating mass transit, video games, e-commerce, and financial technology and retailers will conduct which strategy and which points they want to improve when they are competing the users"
2019-0232,7,"by this way to get more amounts for market sharing and at the last offer, the most effective and useful strategy to vendors with different industry"
2019-0232,8,the research found that the promotion strategy and the circulation strategy are most effective for each manufacturer
2019-0232,9,the strategy is to strengthen the preferential e-currency and the number of special stores
2019-0232,10,"the popularity strategy has the lowest help to increase market share, so manufacturers should avoid it"
2019-0232,11,"the promotion of popularity is the main strategy, while the loyalty strategy is not effective for video game manufacturers and e-commerce vendors"
2019-0232,12,"since users pay the most attention to discounts and convenience, if they can improve, they will attract more users"
2019-0030,0,"identity is fundamental in finance: to protect against fraud and crime, to fulfil know-your-customer obligations, and to ensure market integrity"
2019-0030,1,"at the same time, identification and know-your-customer rules can be major barriers to accessing financial services"
2019-0030,2,this paper considers the various requirements for identification in the financial sector and the evolving nature of identity
2019-0030,3,we argue that technology presents an opportunity to solve this challenge through the development of digital identity infrastructure and related utilities
2019-0030,4,"the establishment of such utilities requires addressing design questions such as registration methods, data availability, and cross-jurisdiction recognitions"
2019-0030,5,"yet, as with any reform, a balance between flow through efficiency and cyber-security needs to be reached to ensure that the objectives of financial inclusion and market integrity are not achieved to the detriment of financial stability"
2019-0065,0,"this article argues that there are many questions that lawyers might ask, and conversations that they might have, about smart contracts"
2019-0065,1,that some questions that are asked are more important than others
2019-0065,2,and that there are some questions that are not asked but which should be asked
2019-0065,3,"first, it is argued that the question that preoccupies coherentists (concerning the application of the law of contract to smart contracts, and the fit between smart contracts and the paradigmatic fiat contracts that are recognised by the law of contract) is neither as puzzling nor as important as might be supposed"
2019-0065,4,"secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a regulatory-instrumentalist nature"
2019-0065,5,"in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set"
2019-0065,6,"thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had"

2019-0015,8,the lack of variability in their responses to the questions about perceived risk would explain this lack of explanatory power
2019-0015,9,"however, willingness to manage cryptocurrency risk could be a precondition for adoption"
2019-0015,10,the performance expectancy for a given cryptocurrency was the most important factor for its success
2019-0015,11,the research was conducted in spain with college-educated adults with basic knowledge of the internet
2019-0267,0,background/objectives: this research will verify the role of service quality and user satisfactionas a control variable in discerning how consumers decide to use mobile service
2019-0267,1,method/statistical analysis: research subjects are consumers who used mobile payment service usage more than once
2019-0267,2,"survey consists of 21 questions: 5 on demographic statistics, 10 on mobile payment service quality, 3 on purpose of mobile payment service usage, 3 onuser satisfaction as a mediating variable, using likerts 5-point-scale measurement"
2019-0267,3,"positive analysis used spss 23.0 for element analysis, reliability analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis to control for variables"
2019-0267,4,"finding: the total variance for mobile payment service element measurement categories is 87.880% and the found eigenvalue is all above 1.0, and the factor score is above 0.5, meeting the reliability and validity of research"
2019-0267,5,regression analysis shows all independent variables affects the dependent variable
2019-0267,6,mediating effects of three categories of mobile payment service on economic usage intention of using mobile payment service hold significant
2019-0267,7,the economics and security of the independent variable and its r2 value incrementally increased and significance probability was below 0.05
2019-0267,8,"therefore, we conclude that even if service quality is high, if user satisfaction is low, intention of using service decreases"
2019-0267,9,"so, we can state that customer satisfaction is important"
2019-0267,10,"improvements/applications: in the future, it is required to develop a measurement tool for items such as user satisfaction and usage intention for more objective measurement"

2019-0012,0,"whether in response to robo advising, artificial intelligence, or cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, regulators around the world have made it a top policy priority to supervise the exponential growth of financial technology (or fintech) in the post-crisis era"
2019-0012,1,"however, applying traditional regulatory strategies to new technological ecosystems has proved conceptually difficult"
2019-0012,2,"part of the challenge lies in managing the trade-offs that accompany the regulation of innovations that could, conceivably, both help and hurt consumers as well as market participants"
2019-0012,3,problems also arise from the common assumption that today's fintech is a mere continuation of the story of innovation that has shaped finance for centuries
2019-0012,4,this article offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and regulating fintech by showing how the supervision of financial innovation is invariably bound by what can be described as a policy trilemma
2019-0012,5,"specifically, we argue that when seeking to provide clear rules, maintain market integrity, and encourage financial innovation, regulators have long been able to achieve, at best, only two out of these three goals"
2019-0012,6,"moreover, today's innovations exacerbate the trade-offs historically embodied in the trilemma by breaking down financial services supply chains into discrete parts and disintermediating traditional functions using cutting edge, but untested, technologies, thereby introducing unprecedented uncertainty as to their risks and benefits"
2019-0012,7,"this article seeks to catalogue the strategies taken by regulatory authorities to navigate the trilemma, and posits them as operating across a spectrum of interrelated responses"
2019-0012,8,"the article then proposes supplemental administrative tools to support not only market, but also regulatory experimentation and innovation"
2019-0269,0,"in the last years, the term financial technology (fintech) has been adopted by literature to describe a wide range of services, aided by several financial technologies, for enterprises or organizations, which mainly address the improvement of the service quality by using information technology (it) applications"
2019-0163,0,this study explores the dynamics of crowd funding mechanisms to support venture development in thailand
2019-0163,1,"under the policy of moving the country towards thailand 4.0, the thai government has placed importance on value-based economy and innovation driven economy"
2019-0163,2,"the empirical analyses, based on the national innovation system (nis) approach, have shown that the thai government plays a key role in building a crowd funding platform to provide entrepreneurial finance for start-ups"
2019-0163,3,the findings point out the barriers both at the policy and operation levels underlying the thai financial innovation system

2019-0009,0,agriculture plays an important in providing food security and sustainability for the people in any country
2019-0009,1,"however, lack of funding and limited distribution channels to reach customers are frequent problems faced by farmers to meet the level of sustainability"
2019-0009,2,"agriculture's sustainability can be strengthened by allowing an innovation of services such as financial technology (fintech), and digital marketplace"
2019-0009,3,digital marketplace with fintech enabled might transform agriculture's business process into more sustainable in term of funding and distribution
2019-0009,4,fintech offers farmers convenient ways of getting sources of funding through crowdfunding and digital payment system
2019-0009,5,"thus, digital marketplace can act as a platform for fintech to integrate the innovative financial solution into broader agriculture's ecosystem"
2019-0009,6,the study proposes a modelling digital marketplace with fintech enabled especially crowdfunding and payment system in order to support agriculture's sustainability
2019-0009,7,"the model connects all actors (farmers, landowners, investors, and consumers) into a platform that can promote transparency, empowerment, resourcefulness, and public engagement in agriculture"
2019-0270,0,the rapid growth of information and communications technology (ict) and implementation of financial technology together make it more convenient for enterprises to do business
2019-0270,1,"meanwhile, the innovations change the ecosystem of financial industry but also present potential threats"
2019-0270,2,"cloud computing, mobile working application, and smart city system are being deployed to enhance life and working conditions for citizens"
2019-0270,3,"nevertheless, cyber-attacks are increasing while security awareness and protection measures need to be improved"
2019-0270,4,"in this paper, security theory and practices of the use of cloud, mobile apps, and smart city system are to discuss"
2019-0270,5,"connected with practice of practitioners in the industry, ideas of security architectures are presented and featured as key points of the financial security 3.0 framework"
2019-0117,0,financial technology (fintech) is considered a taxonomy that describes a wide range of ict (information and communications technology) associated with financial transactions and related operations
2019-0117,1,"improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts"
2019-0117,2,"due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other fintech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering"
2019-0117,3,"this paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process"
2019-0117,4,"with a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation"

2019-0073,0,a large shift towards the use of agile software development in different industrial sectors is evident nowadays
2019-0073,1,financial institutions are not unfamiliar with this tendency since they have the need to respond faster to the changes in their business environments
2019-0073,2,this is partly due to the new generation of financial technology (fintech) companies that have shown a significant difference in time to market and in speeding up software development
2019-0073,3,"to compete with fintech companies, financial institutions are looking for improving their software development processes focusing on applying agile practices in a better way"
2019-0073,4,this article presents a set of proposals to improve software development in the lhv bank
2019-0073,5,the set of proposals has been determined through a literature review and interviews conducted in two leading financial institutions and two fintech companies

2019-0118,0,"fundamental internal and external changes coupled with digitalisation have enabled new market entrants, fintechs, to innovate services, creating competitive solutions to incumbents' offering"
2019-0118,1,the purpose of this article is to understand the service innovation approach of fintech companies
2019-0118,2,"the complexities of service innovation are explained with a theoretical concept of service innovation stack, which presents the multiple components needed for successful service innovation"
2019-0118,3,the usefulness of this construct is observed with a longitudinal case study of 10 fintech startup from finland using interviews and other data
2019-0118,4,"these are shown with a visual representation, which ties in the internal activities with the external ones and shows the interplay between them"
2019-0118,5,"with the representation of the service innovation stack, the service innovation within financial industry can be better understood and further developed"
2019-0118,6,"the authors further suggest that though the framework is based on cases from fintech startups, it might be relevant also for the incumbents"

2019-0033,3,"in the sight of resource-based view and dynamic capability, jd builds an iterative process to conduct scf practice"
2019-0033,4,"enabling factors, mainly financial technology (fintech) and bargaining power, play critical roles in the decision-making process"
2019-0033,5,the development of fintech facilitates the digitalization and capitalization process by improving transparency and efficiency while bargaining power influences the productization process
2019-0033,6,the adoption of scf practice helps jd build closer partnership with supply chain partners and improves its own competitive advantage
2019-0092,0,"in this article, we present an overview of the research on discrimination in mortgage underwriting and pricing, the experiences of minority borrowers both prior to and during the financial crisis, and federal efforts to mitigate foreclosures during the crisis"
2019-0092,1,"we next discuss the history of legal cases alleging disparate treatment of minority borrowers, and recent cases alleging disparate impact in the wake of the supreme courts inclusive communities decision"
2019-0092,2,"using these discussions as a background, we examine and discuss mortgage regulations issued by the consumer finance protection bureau following the financial crisis, describe recent developments in the fintech industry and explore the implications for fair lending policy and minority borrowers more generally"
2019-0092,3,"finally, we draw conclusions and make recommendations for improving the mortgage market outcomes of minority borrowers and increasing minority borrowers access to credit"
2019-0094,0,investor behavior was shown to be considerably different when the risk-return tradeoff is presented by experience sampling as opposed to a descriptive communication
2019-0094,1,we analyze the persistency of this difference in a setting in which investors are faced with multiple decisions over time and are consequently able to adjust the risk level they initially chose
2019-0094,2,"for this we use an experimental setting with repeated investment decisions over multiple trading days, and we also test a new form of risk simulation in which wealth paths over time are presented rather than just final outcomes"
2019-0094,3,"after investors initial decisions, for which we confirm previous findings, we do not find persistent differences of simulation-based learning on investors risk-taking behavior"
2019-0094,4,"with regards to trading volume, only a simulation in which investors see wealth paths and not only final outcomes leads to lower trading frequency soon after the initial asset allocation"
2019-0271,0,"this paper presents the random neural network in a deep learning cluster structure with a new learning algorithm based on the genome model, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves"
2019-0271,1,the proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons
2019-0271,2,"the innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: reinforcement learning takes fast and local decisions, deep learning clusters provide identity and memory, deep learning management clusters take final strategic decisions and finally genetic learning transmits the learned information to future generations"
2019-0271,3,"this structure has been applied and validated in fintech, a bitcoin smart investment application based in an intelligent banker that performs buy and sell decisions on several cryptocurrencies with an associated exchange and risk"
2019-0271,4,our results are promising
2019-0271,5,"we have connected the human brain and genetics with machine learning based on the random neural network model where artificial intelligence, similar as biology, is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment"
2019-0018,0,"the emerging prosperity of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, has come into the spotlight during the past few years"
2019-0018,1,"cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of bitcoin"
2019-0018,2,"thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well"
2019-0018,3,not only bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain
2019-0018,4,"however, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools"
2019-0018,5,"previous methods of visualizing bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods"
2019-0018,6,"in this paper, we present bitextract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client"
2019-0018,7,"in particular, bitextract summarizes the evolution of the bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view"
2019-0018,8,a node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution
2019-0018,9,"moreover, bitextract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges"
2019-0018,10,three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system
2019-0108,0,equity crowdfunding is a relatively new investment format that allows investors to purchase unlisted securities from a company that does not meet listing requirements for an initial public offering
2019-0108,1,"equity crowdfunding offers investment rewards but also has risks of fraud, herding, insolvency and dilution of shareholder equity"
2019-0108,2,"regulation is a natural response to negative externalities like systemic risk caused by asymmetric information, adverse selection and lemon problems"
2019-0108,3,"while the us and the uk have extensive crowdfunding regulations, hong kong does not, although crowdfunding is not specifically banned under the securities and futures ordinance"
2019-0108,4,"this article focuses on the current state of equity crowdfunding in hong kong but draws inspiration from legal requirements for equity crowdfunding in the us, the uk and singapore, as well as the korea startup market in south korea"
2019-0108,5,the author makes regulatory suggestions for consideration by hong kongs law-makers and policy-makers
2019-0109,0,most wealth management firms offer online platforms where investors with varied levels of comfort with technology manage their portfolios
2019-0109,1,past research shows that comfort with technology is crucial for users acceptance of new technologies
2019-0109,2,we investigated how users comfort level with technology influences their use of a new wealth management online platform
2019-0109,3,"we used a multi-modal approach that incorporates survey, behavioral, eye-tracking and neural measures to assess investors comfort with technology on web-platform usability to provide a rigorous test of the effects of comfort with technology on usability experiences for a wealth management firm"
2019-0109,4,our findings suggest that traditional survey measures do not show any differences in users evaluations
2019-0109,5,"however, behavioral and neurophysiological measures reveal insights that traditional survey measures fail to reveal"
2019-0115,0,in this article is presented a review of the state of the art on financial technology (fintech) for the design of a novel recommender system
2019-0115,1,"a social computing platform is proposed, based on virtual organizations (vos), that allows to improve user experience in actions that is associated with the process of investment recommendation"
2019-0115,2,the work presents agents functionalities and an algorithm that will improve the accuracy of the recommender_agent which is in charge of the case-based reasoning (cbr) system
2019-0115,3,"the data that will be collected and will feed the cbr corresponds to users characteristics, the asset classes, profitability, interest rate, history stock market information and financial news published in the media"
2019-0055,0,"in peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, it is important to predict default of borrowers because the lenders would suffer financial loss if the borrower fails to pay money"
2019-0055,1,"the huge lending transaction data generated online helps to predict repayment of the borrowers, but there are limitations in extracting features based on the complex information"
2019-0055,2,convolutional neural networks (cnn) can automatically extract useful features from large p2p lending data
2019-0055,3,"however, as deep cnn becomes more complex and deeper, the information about input vanishes and overfitting occurs"
2019-0055,4,"in this paper, we propose a deep dense convolutional networks (densenet) for default prediction in p2p social lending to automatically extract features and improve the performance"
2019-0055,5,densenet ensures the flow of loan information through dense connectivity and automatically extracts discriminative features with convolution and pooling operations
2019-0055,6,we capture the complex features of lending data and reuse loan information to predict the repayment of the borrower
2019-0055,7,"experimental results show that the proposed method automatically extracts useful features from lending club data, avoids overfitting, and is effective in default prediction"
2019-0055,8,"in comparison with deep cnn and other machine learning methods, the proposed method has achieved the highest performance with 79.6%"
2019-0055,9,we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method as the 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance
2019-0084,0,"motivated by recently introduced retail payment schemes using information technology, often called fintech, we examine the effect of fraud liability regime on antifraud investment in a fintech payment scheme, where the front-end and back-end services are vertically separated"
2019-0084,1,"in an environment where a fintech payment service provider (fpp) covers only the front-end services, delegating the back-end services to an integrated payment service provider (ipp) such as banks and credit card companies, we show that under the ipp liability regime, the ipp invests more in general, while the respective investment depends on the range of the access fee under the fpp liability regime"
2019-0084,2,"specifically, given a sufficiently great loss from accident, if the access fee is in a certain range, the fpp liability regime is superior in terms of antifraud investment"
2019-0084,3,"when the fpp makes its indirect revenue from its user base in addition to the revenue from user fees, we can observe greater antifraud investment under both liability regimes, but the overall decrease in fraud probability is higher under the ipp liability regime"
2019-0084,4,"our results suggest that it might be desirable to induce fpp liability regime, which might necessitate regulating the access fee to achieve such an outcome"
2019-0084,5,"(jel g23, g28, d43, l22)"
2018-0048,0,"in recent years, social movements have echoed calls for greater social and environmental responsibility"
2018-0048,1,"although financial institutions promote development, consumers have lost confidence in banks"
2018-0048,2,"as we enter the fintech era, banks have the opportunity to use new tools that enable greater transparency for customers"
2018-0048,3,"corporate social responsibility (csr) plays a key role in increasing social awareness of regulators, society, shareholders, and employeesin short, stakeholders"
2018-0048,4,this study therefore focuses on banks that have designed their activities and investments to contribute to sustainability
2018-0048,5,the principal contribution of this paper is to show the existence of a range of business models that arise following different responses by different types of banks
2018-0048,6,"these different responses occur because the primary objective of sustainable banks is to meet the needs of stakeholders and contribute to sustainable development, whereas conventional banks simply apply and execute csr policies"
2018-0048,7,it is possible to differentiate between ethical banks and commercial banks
2018-0048,8,"to ensure economic progress and achieve sustainability, it is fundamental to balance economic profitability with peoples social and environmental aspirations"
2018-0189,0,"due to the big data and fintech influencers, the novel sentifine framework was developed to facilitate the financial analysts or specialists who need to understand the financial and economic circumstances from the daily news"
2018-0189,1,the objective of this framework is to analyze the sentiment of thai financial daily news by integrating the fine-grained sentiment analysis technique with the deep neural network
2018-0189,2,"based on the proposed sentifine framework, the prototype of the sentifine web-based system was developed"
2018-0189,3,"with the main feature view daily news, the users can view the daily thai financial news detail, the date and time of the news, the source of news, and its sentiment which is categorized into three tones (positive, neutral, and negative)"
2018-0188,0,it is very useful to endow machines with the ability to understand users' personalized preferences
2018-0188,1,"in this paper, we propose a novel methodology for discovering investors' personalized preferences in stock markets"
2018-0188,2,"our work is able to estimate investors' personalized preferences for each stock and thus helpful for realizing investment recommendation, for instance through recommending real-time news or others' opinions on stocks preferred by the target user"
2018-0188,3,"compared to conventional approaches, our method effectively incorporates stock movements for estimating investors' preference"
2018-0188,4,"by capturing stock-movement patterns influencing users' preferences, our method can find users with a similar investment philosophy and then increase the effect of preference prediction"
2018-0188,5,an experimental evaluation with two real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach
2018-0107,0,european microfinance suffers from a visibility deficit
2018-0107,1,it is rarely mentioned in the media
2018-0107,2,our research question is why does european microfinance suffer from a lack of visibility in the press? this study looked at news reports and press releases over a 18-month period (20162018) to check if european microfinance and its innovations were in the news
2018-0107,3,"the study finds that, indeed, there are a lot of new innovations in finance"
2018-0107,4,"but, first, in europe, the highly talked about fintech innovations are taking place outside of microfinance institutions (mfis)"
2018-0107,5,"second, the innovations that are talked about in microfinance are taking place in developing countries out of europe"
2018-0107,6,the study followed this up by examining websites of some of the leading european fintech firms to see what they were doing that made them so visible
2018-0107,7,"we share some best practices in the use of digital technologies by highly innovative fintech firms in areas that could be of use to mfis in diverse sectors such as mobile payments, credit scoring, card readers, atms and management information systems"
2018-0107,8,"to become visible, european microfinance may need to demonstrate that it is doing new things and that it is using innovative technologies that helps it reduce costs, increase outreach and, thus, have an impact"
2018-0107,9,forii such as the european microfinance network and the european microfinance platform need to promote these innovations by offering appropriate awards
2018-0107,10,"finally, collaborating with training and educational institutes may help add to visibility"
2018-0146,0,"the payment services market is evolving at an accelerating rate, driven by continuous technological innovations and major legislative developments"
2018-0146,1,"one such piece of legislation is the revised payment services directive (psd2), which intends to further define a common legal framework for the payment market in the european economic area, with the aim of increasing the level of integration and efficiency in the market, as well as increasing the level of consumer protection"
2018-0146,2,"in this context, the enhancement of collaborative infrastructures can be the keystone to anticipate and transform the challenges of psd2 into opportunities"
2018-0146,3,"this paper describes the creation of an open banking platform, called cbi globe  global open banking ecosystem, to facilitate the interconnection between banks and third parties through application programming interfaces, in line with the new directive"

2018-0054,0,"the infusion of digital technology into financial services, also known as fintech, is creating a massive disruption of the entire financial sector"
2018-0054,1,"services traditionally offered by incumbents are now rapidly unbundled by a growing set of startups, leading to new models of collaboration and a significant shift in power"
2018-0054,2,"this study provides insight into the structure of the fintech ecosystem using data-driven visualizations of 6,493 global companies across 24 market segments"
2018-0054,3,"we focus on two types of ecosystem entities, namely, (1) firms that create, offer, and acquire fintech services and (2) investors that fund and enable them"
2018-0054,4,"our analyses reveal a highly skewed global footprint of fintech activities, differential growth patterns across ecosystem segments, highly interdependent network structure, and a variegated nature of investments and acquisitions led by key incumbents and venture capital firms"
2018-0054,5,we conclude with theoretical and managerial implications and discuss opportunities for future service ecosystem research
2018-0190,0,the text starts from a review of new theoretical issues posed by cryptocurrencies with respect to traditional money
2018-0190,1,"the research then shows how the essence of the traditional monetary phenomenon lies in the figure of money, understood as a symbol endowed with particular functions"
2018-0190,2,"having said that, monetary functions can also be performed by cryptocurrencies"
2018-0190,3,"the text continues on to note that the cryptocurrencies phenomenon is but a continuation of the money dematerialisation process, which gained strong traction in particular during the last century"
2018-0190,4,"today, fintech is faced with a choice: whether to favour the application of technology to payments brokered by third parties, or to encourage the formation and circulation of these new monetary forms"

2018-0010,0,"based on a systematic review of influential publications among 402 papers published between 2010 and 2018, this paper identifies gaps in economics and finance research regarding two applications of fintech: crowdfunding and blockchain"
2018-0010,1,analysing these records shows that (i) current research on fintech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding
2018-0010,2,(ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways
2018-0010,3,"(iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation"
2018-0010,4,"(iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries"
2018-0010,5,and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all

2018-0004,1,"we study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth"
2018-0004,2,"difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burdencapital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to office of comptroller and currency following closure of the office of thrift supervisionall reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints"
2018-0004,3,shadow banks partially filled these gaps
2018-0004,4,"relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market"
2018-0004,5,fintech lenders charge a premium of 1416 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers
2018-0004,6,they seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders
2018-0004,7,"a quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%"

2018-0042,1,a new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy
2018-0042,2,"at the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses"
2018-0042,3,"however, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions"
2018-0042,4,technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers rights and interests
2018-0042,5,"this new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology"

2018-0133,0,financial technology (fintech) is a new phenomenon that is currently growing rapidly in indonesia
2018-0133,1,"the use of fintech as a means of payment becomes a new phenomenon, while the continuous development of the online transport system is becoming a complement for the ease of users"
2018-0133,2,"however, the developments that occur produce the impact of the inherent risk to the system and to the users of the service"
2018-0133,3,"therefore, this study aims to see the correlation between inherent risk factors that users feel from various aspects, and do the inherent risk influence the usage of financial technology especially in online transportation system? the research was conducted using a quantitative statistical method by using spss correlation bivariate and a descriptive analysis"

2018-0134,0,"the commentaries on this forums anchor article, chinas integration into the global financial system: toward a state-led conception of global financial networks, examine how the state is shaping global financial networks (gfns)"
2018-0134,1,"in response to these reviews, this article discusses three common themes that bind the different commentaries: (1) different types of agency, power, and the rise of new actors"
2018-0134,2,(2) the methodology behind studying state-led gfns
2018-0134,3,and (3) the structural question of chinese exceptionalism as a mode of capitalism
2018-0134,4,"overall, this article affirms that the state remains central to our understanding of competitive hierarchies and firm behavior in financial networks"
2018-0030,0,"financial technology, also known as fintech, is a fast-evolving field that has reshaped the financial industry"
2018-0030,1,"ant financial has redefined digital financial services, specifically mobile payment and microloan services, and ping an technology has developed"
2018-0024,0,"in less than a decade bitcoin and the technology of blockchain  a cryptographically-secured, algorithmically-regulated, distributed-ledger  emerged as the enfant terrible of the global economy"
2018-0024,1,"ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust"
2018-0024,2,not only has bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations
2018-0024,3,"this article reviews blockchain's computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices"
2018-0024,4,"this analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality"
2018-0024,5,nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of bitcoin or blockchain
2018-0044,0,information processing filters out the noise in data but it takes time
2018-0044,1,"hence, low precision signals are available before high precision signals"
2018-0044,2,we analyze how this feature affects asset price informativeness when investors can acquire signals of increasing precision over time about the payoff of an asset
2018-0044,3,"as the cost of low precision signals declines, prices are more likely to reflect these signals before more precise signals become available"
2018-0044,4,"this effect can ultimately reduce price informativeness because it reduces the demand for more precise signals (e.g., fundamental analysis)"
2018-0044,5,we make additional predictions for trade and price patterns
2018-0007,0,the purpose of this paper is to develop an insight and review the effect of fintech development against the broader environment in financial technology
2018-0007,1,"we further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of fintech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem"
2018-0007,2,"by drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system"

2018-0007,5,"while it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented"
2018-0007,6,"it relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries"
2018-0007,7,"it also draws on professional practitioners roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant"
2018-0007,8,"we attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective"
2018-0007,9,the last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision
2018-0007,10,it has made the financial market law and compliance a key topic on the current agenda
2018-0007,11,disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change
2018-0007,12,we contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications
2018-0007,13,we also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain
2018-0007,14,the aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration
2018-0007,15,the difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation
2018-0007,16,"disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry"
2018-0007,17,it becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves
2018-0007,18,"for example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes"
2018-0007,19,"such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system"
2018-0007,20,our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice
2018-0007,21,"these should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts"
2018-0007,22,"as a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain"
2018-0007,23,"it is also of interest to bankers who might consider fintech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1"
2018-0002,0,"in this work, we provide the first comprehensive description of the initial coin offering (ico) phenomenon, which by the end of 2017 allowed startups around the world to raise more than $5.3 billion, according to market observers"
2018-0002,1,we analyze the determinants of the success of these token offerings by considering a sample of 253 campaigns
2018-0002,2,"we find that the probability of an ico's success is higher if the code source is available, when a token presale is organized, and when tokens allow contributors to access a specific service (or to share profits)"
2018-0002,3,our results provide valuable insights into this new source of capital for businesses and into the key determinants of fundraising success
2018-0014,0,fintech has been playing an increasing role in shaping financial and banking landscapes

2018-0014,2,banks with assets over $50 billion to examine whether the fintech lending platform could expand credit access to consumers
2018-0014,3,"we find that lendingclub's consumer lending activities have penetrated areas that may be underserved by traditional banks, such as in highly concentrated markets and areas that have fewer bank branches per capita"
2018-0014,4,we also find that the portion of lendingclub loans increases in areas where the local economy is not performing well
2018-0143,0,"fintech, short for ""financial technology,"" has advanced the process of transforming financial business from a traditional manualprocess- driven to an automation-driven model by providing various software platforms"
2018-0143,1,"however, the current fintech-industry still heavily depends on manual testing, which becomes the bottleneck of fintech industry development"
2018-0143,2,"to automate the testing process, we propose an approach of black-box testing for a fin- tech system with effective tool support for both test generation and test oracles"
2018-0143,3,"for test generation, we first extract input categories from business-logic specifications, and then mutate real data collected from system logs with values randomly picked from each extracted input category"
2018-0143,4,"for test oracles, we propose a new technique of priority differential testing where we evaluate execution results of system-test inputs on the system's head (i.e., latest) version in the version repository (1) against the last legacy version in the version repository (only when the executed test inputs are on new, not-yet-deployed services) and (2) against both the currently-deployed version and the last legacy version (only when the test inputs are on existing, deployed services)"
2018-0143,5,"when we rank the behavior-inconsistency results for developers to inspect, for the latter case, we give the currently-deployed version as a higherpriority source of behavior to check"
2018-0143,6,"we apply our approach to the cstp subsystem, one of the largest data processing and forwarding modules of the china foreign exchange trade system (cfets) platform, whose annual total transaction volume reaches 150 trillion us dollars"
2018-0143,7,"extensive experimental results show that our approach can substantially boost the branch coverage by approximately 40%, and is also efficient to identify common faults in the fintech system"
2018-0067,0,robo-advisors has been growing attraction from the financial industry for offering financial services by using algorithms and acting as like human advisors to support investors making investment decisions
2018-0067,1,"during the investment planning stage, portfolio optimization plays a crucial role, especially for the medium and long-term investors, in determining the allocation weight of assets to achieve the balance between investors expectation return and risk tolerance"
2018-0067,2,the literature on the topic of portfolio optimization has been offering plenty of theoretical and practical guidance for implementing the theory
2018-0067,3,"however, there is a paucity of studies focusing on the applications which are designed for robo-advisors"
2018-0067,4,"in this research, we proposed a modular system and focused on integrating big data analysis, deep learning method and the black-litterman model to generate asset allocation weight"
2018-0067,5,"we developed a portfolio optimization module which takes the information from a variety of sources, such as stocks prices, investor profile and the other alternative data, and used them as input to calculate optimal weights of assets in the portfolio"
2018-0067,6,"the module we developed could be used as a sub-system for robe-advisors, which offers a customized optimal portfolio based on investors preference"
2018-0094,0,"with the advent of the artificial intelligence (ai) era, the combination of ai with financial technology (fintech) has become a development trend in the financial industry"
2018-0094,1,"however, deep learning (dl) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated"
2018-0094,2,"thus, this research focuses on the applications of fintech and dl in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio"
2018-0094,3,the best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets
2018-0094,4,"time series models for dl, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory"
2018-0094,5,"in this research, we use the markowitz mean-variance and black-litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor"
2018-0094,6,results show that the black-litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies
2018-0094,7,the human-computer interaction (hci) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (aiml) and a generative model
2018-0094,8,the main contribution of this paper is that we have developed an integrated knowledge-based and generative-based models for ai conversational robo-advisor

2018-0186,1,"with the increasing importance of bitcoin, many related topics require further clarification"
2018-0186,2,"because bitcoin is a popular financial asset, determining whether the price information is fully circulated among trading platforms has been the focus of many studies in recent years"
2018-0186,3,the method for verifying the efficient market hypothesis relates to whether the price series is a random walk
2018-0186,4,"that is, whether a unit root exists"
2018-0186,5,"according to the literature, whether the price of bitcoin satisfies the efficient market hypothesis remains controversial"
2018-0186,6,"however, these studies have not considered nonlinear data structures"
2018-0186,7,"to deal with the structural change of data, this study employed different unit root tests, namely the zivot-andrews unit root test and kapetanios-shin unit root test, to investigate bitcoins' relationship to the efficient market hypothesis"
2018-0186,8,"if the efficient market hypothesis is validated, the price formed by the bitcoin trading platform is close to a perfectly competitive mechanism, and the information can be quickly and completely reflected in the price, with information of different trading platforms having mutual influence"
2018-0186,9,"therefore, this study applied the threshold vector autoregressive model to explore price information transmission between various trading platforms"
2018-0186,10,the contribution of this research is its exploration of the financial tools derived from the highly developed fields of financial science and technology
2018-0186,11,this is helpful for providing new methods for completing financial transactions or a platform for speculators to engage in arbitrage
2018-0147,0,japanese digital consumer electronics manufacturer declined and collapsed
2018-0147,1,it is said that the cause is the modularization of technology in architecture theory
2018-0147,2,"there is a japanese industry that is similarly undergoing modularization, which is the financial industry"
2018-0147,3,this paper clarified that fintech modularizes financial technology
2018-0147,4,"for that purpose, we analyzed the function and structure of fintech"
2018-0147,5,"also, although it is possible that fintech could change the existing financial industry structure in japan, the objective was to propose from the case consideration that the management strategy in that environment is keystone strategy"
2018-0147,6,"as a conclusion, fintech was found to be modularized because it has increased its added value after fragmenting financial services technology and breaking it apart"
2018-0147,7,"in addition, even if it continues to stay in the integral part, its comprehensive financial services part is inferior to fintech, so it was expected that it cannot stay in the integral"
2018-0092,0,"technological innovation, recent regulatory initiatives and mass consumers' changing expectations are quickly re-shaping the payments' sector, paving the way to a more open environment where even non-banking players see a huge opportunity to gain momentum and disrupt the incumbents, namely the financial institutions"

2018-0125,1,"in this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of fintech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance"
2018-0125,2,"using a comprehensive sample of chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (smes), we find that state-owned enterprises (soes) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek fintech finance"
2018-0125,3,"in the chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which soe smes can access cheaper conventional finance through soe banks"
2018-0125,4,the quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of fintech financing
2018-0125,5,"as for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by rd activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of fintech finance for innovative high-growth firms"
2018-0047,0,inclusive financial systems play a critical role in fostering economic growth and development
2018-0047,1,"however, the question of what is the best means of achieving this has long been a puzzle"
2018-0047,2,"in this article, i use the mobile money revolution in sub-saharan africa to show that the greatest examples of financial development have come from nations embracing a market-led approach that removes repressive regulations and gives entrepreneurs the freedom to discover innovative ways to access the unbanked"
2018-0047,3,"comparing the successes and failures of mobile money across the continent over the past decade, i argue that the best predictor of whether a country will reap the benefits of these transformative innovations is whether its government embraces a laissez-faire, or enabling, regulatory approach that encourages entrepreneurship and experimentation"
2018-0149,0,"disruption technologies, blockchain, fintech  already not new anymore, as a fashion in disrupting technologies, fintech became for years pretty well known as an insertion of high tech in the financial service industry"
2018-0149,1,"but  as already mentioned in my previous paper work on this topic  banking and other financial services, more and more developed under the absorption of the new tech attack, didnt change too much inside the corporations, and i was referring especially at the transforming of the finance function over there"
2018-0149,2,"and this transformation does not simply require the deeper immersion of new and high tech inside the finance of companies, though it matters first, rather than the preparation of people to support this"
2018-0117,0,the purpose of the study was too disruptive technology
2018-0117,1,the rapid changes in technology due to the innovation has brought an impacts in changes on human lifestyle
2018-0117,2,technology simplifies and accelerates human being in doing its activity
2018-0117,3,the development of digital technology (disruptive technology) has an impact on all aspects of human life
2018-0117,4,the purpose of this research is to see the phenomenon of the conventional banking in indonesia to make changes in its business processes in order to compete with fintechs company that is growing rapidly
2018-0117,5,this research method looks at the phenomenon on conventional banking in indonesia by looking at the impact of technology and digital
2018-0117,6,"the first phenomenon is the rapid development in the world currently occur in the digital economy, one of which is a digital-based financial service known as financial technology (fintech)"
2018-0117,7,"the second phenomenon is digital technology has been able to change the behavior of indonesian people in all aspects of life, such as electronic books, electronic newspapers, online sales and public transportation (taxis and motorcycles)"
2018-0117,8,"the third phenomenon is fintechs services in indonesia include payment channel system, digital banking, online/digital insurance, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending and crow funding"
2018-0117,9,banks should be able to balance the development of this digital technology by providing new products that are close to customer's wishes
2018-0117,10,there is a gap that has not been served by banks in indonesia that resulted in the emergence of potential benefits that can be taken by start-up company (pioneer) fintech in providing services and banking products
2018-0117,11,banking in indonesia can synergize with start-up companies (pioneer) fintech by changing its business process by doing business process reengineering (bpr)
2018-0185,0,"in indonesia, internet users from 2013 to 2018 have increased about 52%"
2018-0185,1,this growth indicates that people behaviour change in many aspects of life including in economy
2018-0185,2,one example is (fintech p2p lending)
2018-0185,3,"p2p lending is a service that offers online borrowing, lenders can loan to small business or individuals"
2018-0185,4,this is in line with the indonesia financial services sector master plan 2015-2019
2018-0185,5,"indonesia support the rapid growth of the financial technology ecosystem, but there is need good understanding between related parties such as p2p lending companies, lenders and borrowers"
2018-0185,6,a system dynamics act as calculators to takes value to fill payoff table in game theory
2018-0185,7,integration of system dynamics and game theory can produce the best strategy for fintech p2p lending in running its business while considering profit for lenders and borrowers
2018-0185,8,the best strategy is known by use non-cooperative and cooperative game theory
2018-0185,9,"the result shown the best strategy for each player with non-cooperative game is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses high level of roi"
2018-0185,10,"in cooperative game, the best strategy is when the company chooses a high level of profit margin, borrower chooses low level of debt time, and lender chooses low level of roi"
2018-0136,0,"with the deep application and development of information technology in the financial field, fintech (financial technology) has become a hot topic in the financial industry and the scientific and technological community"
2018-0136,1,"the fintech industry's development model is continuously developing and innovating, and it constantly impacts and transforms the traditional financial industry"
2018-0136,2,"fintech has become the country's policy direction and economic development trend, leading to an increase in fintech's talent demand, and the development of fintech's talent has become critical"
2018-0136,3,"this paper describes the situation of fintech industry from three aspects: the development of fintech industry at home and abroad, the demand of fintech talents and the training status of fintech talents"
2018-0136,4,this paper also suggests that colleges and universities should seize the opportunity to explore new teaching modes such as school-enterprise cooperation for fintech and providing good talents protection for the development of fintech

2018-0184,0,"with the development of cloud computing and ict at present, financial technology has undergone major changes in recent years"
2018-0184,1,"the big data technology has been used to combine internal and external information, called weighted forecasting"
2018-0184,2,"the fundamentals of internal information include company financial statements, after-hours transaction information and other information"
2018-0184,3,the technical facet analysis aspects include moving average and a variety of indicators
2018-0184,4,"also, external information includes taiwan stock market related articles called chip facet analysis.in this paper, three facets were systematically analyzed to find the weights and calculate the fluctuation trend of individual stock, thereby more accurately predicting fluctuations in the following month"
2018-0184,5,"also, this paper took taiwan's financial stock as an example"
2018-0184,6,the simulation-based period was from january to september 2017
2018-0184,7,the external information sources include: cnyes.com
2018-0184,8,and moneydj
2018-0184,9,"first, the initial weighted ratio of 8:2 for the internal and external information was found, and rolling learning was done to make adjustments and predict the monthly fluctuation from october to december 2017"
2018-0184,10,empirical results show that the accuracy of the traditional forecasting in predicting actual fluctuation trend is 62.25%
2018-0184,11,the internal information is the data reference of the fundamental and technical facets analysis
2018-0184,12,"after coupled with the chip facet analysis was added and the three facets analyzed, the accuracy of the actual individual stock fluctuations obtained using weighted forecasting is 73.55%"
2018-0184,13,"overall, the weighted forecasting can be used to calculate fluctuations of individual stock, also enhancing the accuracy of predicting stock fluctuations the following month, also serve as a reference for experts and investors"
2018-0040,0,"complementing europe's bank-based system with deeper capital markets and more cross-border financial integration promises benefits, but despite long-running debate and policy action, financial system change remains slow"
2018-0040,1,fintech has the potential to change financial intermediation structures substantially
2018-0040,2,"it could disrupt existing intermediation with new business models empowered by intelligent algorithms, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence"
2018-0040,3,lower costs and potentially better consumer experiences could be the driving forces
2018-0040,4,"yet, empirically, fintech remains very small, especially in the european union (eu)"
2018-0040,5,"even the largest fintech market, in china, is of marginal size compared to overall financial intermediation"
2018-0040,6,"in the eu, much of fintech is concentrated in the uk"
2018-0040,7,we argue that policymakers need to consider four questions urgently
2018-0040,8,(i) develop a european or national fintech market? (ii) what regulatory framework to pursue? (iii) should supervision of fintech be exercised at the european level? (iv) what is the overall vision for the eu's financial system? getting the answers to these questions right at an early stage of market development constitutes an opportunity to shape a stable and cost-efficient financial system
2018-0040,9,"in contrast, late action could mean that europe loses out to foreign competitors and misses an opportunity to improve financial intermediation in europe"
2018-0032,0,robots and chatbots are sophisticated
2018-0032,1,"artificial intelligence (ai) is increasingly popular in the financial industry due to its ability to provide customers with cheap, efficient and personalised services"
2018-0032,2,this article uses doctrinal sources and a case study to show that many banks and fintech start-ups are investing in ai
2018-0032,3,"yet, there are a number of challenges arising from the use of ai which could undermine trust and confidence amongst consumers"
2018-0032,4,this article features the issue of bias and discrimination in banking
2018-0032,5,there is evidence that algorithms discriminate against certain races and gender
2018-0032,6,legislative gaps in the equality act 2010 and the general data protection regime will be analysed
2018-0032,7,"ultimately, human beings are still needed to input, train and help machines to learn"
2018-0032,8,"fortunately, the fca are leading in regulating technology, from the launch of regulatory sandboxes to their co-operative collaboration with fintech start-ups on regulatory matters"
2018-0032,9,augmented intelligence collaboration is needed to enable industry players and regulators to provide seamless regulation and financial stability
2018-0032,10,the future of ai regulation is interdisciplinary in approach
2018-0142,0,"fintech, which is a shorthand expression for financial technology, is basically referring to all the technological innovations in the financial sector that started to develop exponentially, especially in the second decade of the 21st century, in the era of the mobile internet revolution"
2018-0142,1,"the generation z, also called gen tech, who was growing up using the internet and especially the mobile internet on a daily basis, will probably be the larger adopter and beneficiary of these innovative financial technologies"
2018-0142,2,"the current generation of students, born about twenty years ago, is part of this cohort and this is why we decided to initiate a study regarding their perception and behavior concerning the fintech area with the help of a questionnaire applied on some of the students of the faculty of european studies from babes-bolyai university"
2018-0142,3,"because the fintech is covering financial innovations from a very broad area (including cryptocurrency, online payments, financial transfers, openbanking, investments, regtech, insurtech, etc.) we decided to focus in this preliminary study, only on the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies and in relation to these, on the online payments"
2018-0183,0,"the office of the comptroller of the currency is responsible for ensuring federally chartered banks' safety and soundness, compliance with federal banking laws, and compliance with federal laws regarding fair access to financial services and fair treatment of customers"
2018-0183,1,"the states have historically overseen and regulated nonbank companies, including nonbank financial services providers like money transmitters, mortgage lenders, consumer lenders, and debt collectors"
2018-0183,2,applicable regulations include state safety and soundness requirements and both state and federal consumer protection and anti-money laundering laws
2018-0183,3,"in 2016, the occ announced its intention to create a new national bank charter for nonbank companies, thus pulling chartered nonbank fintech companies into the national bank regulatory system"
2018-0183,4,"this will potentially preempt and replace the licensing, regulation, and supervision responsibilities of state authorities while allowing circumvention of other regulatory safeguards"
2018-0183,5,"moreover, this power grab by the occ is beyond its authority as delegated by congress"
2018-0183,6,"in addition to questions of the legality of the charters and whether state or federal regulators are better situated to regulate such institutions, the proposed charters raise significant concerns regarding the separation of commerce and banking that has been a hallmark of the u.s"
2018-0183,7,financial regulatory system since the founding of the country
2018-0051,0,"as a new form of the fintech industry, initial coin offerings (icos) underwent a period of explosive growth in china since the second half of 2016 and were banned in september 2017"
2018-0051,1,"however, the outright ban on icos may hamper revolutionary technological developments and dampen the growth of this potentially beneficial market"
2018-0051,2,"in quest of a solution to meet the regulatory challenges rather than completely stifling the innovation, a comparative analysis has been conducted in some advanced economies, including the us, canada, australia, singapore, hong kong, the uk and the eu in order to propose a regulatory framework for icos in china"
2018-0051,3,"after a thorough analysis of relevant experiences and regulatory measures in overseas jurisdictions, this paper provides a non-exhaustive classification of the legal status of icos, namely pre-sale of products or services, offering of shares, issue of debentures, issue of derivatives, collective investment schemes and crowdfunding, as well as a possible regulatory reform of the current ico ban in china"
2018-0051,4,"it is then concluded that except for icos that can be regarded as pre-sale of products or services, the other five types of icos are highly likely to be considered as financial securities and thus should be subject to securities laws"

2018-0023,0,manuscript type: empirical research question/issue: where are fintech venture capital investments taking place around the world? what is the role of institutional factors on the international allocation of fintech venture capital? research findings/insights: we document a notable change in the pattern of fintech venture capital (vc) investments around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis
2018-0023,1,we show that fintech venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the financial crisis
2018-0023,2,"also, we show the fintech boom is more pronounced for smaller private limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior venture capital booms and busts"
2018-0023,3,"these fintech vc deals are substantially more likely to be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center"
2018-0023,4,theoretical/academic implications: we build on the institutions and corporate governance literatures by showing the importance of enforcement in driving relative differences in investment patterns and investor participation
2018-0023,5,"for entrepreneurial startups, regulatory arbitrage drives investment into countries with a dearth of enforcement and regulatory costs"
2018-0023,6,we argue that the spike in fintech venture capital in certain countries is attributable to differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large established financial institutions after the financial crisis
2018-0023,7,practitioner/policy implications: regulatory arbitrage in the context of fintech venture capital can spur booms and busts
2018-0023,8,less experienced venture capitalists seem more prone to undertake investments that exacerbate boom and bust cycles
2018-0023,9,"national governance is strengthened by the enforcement of regulatory standards, and corporate governance through investor experience and oversight can mitigate these swings, and facilitate better investment outcomes"
2018-0079,0,microfinance can be an important tool for fighting global poverty by increasing access to loans and possibly lowering interest rates through microlending
2018-0079,1,"however, the dominant mechanism used by online microfinance platforms, in which intermediaries administer loans, has profound implications for borrowers"
2018-0079,2,"using an analytical model of microlending with intermediaries who disburse and service loans, we demonstrate that profit-maximizing intermediaries have an incentive to increase interest rates because much of the default risk is transferred to lenders"
2018-0079,3,borrower and lender interest rate elasticities can serve as disciplining mechanisms to mitigate this interest rate increase
2018-0079,4,"using data from kiva.org, we find that interest rates do not affect lender decisions, which removes one of these disciplining mechanisms"
2018-0079,5,"interest rates are high, around 38% on kiva"
2018-0079,6,"in contrast, on an alternative microfinance platform that does not use intermediaries, zidisha, interest rates are only around 10%, highlighting the dramatic impact of intermediaries on interest rates"
2018-0079,7,"we propose an alternative loan payback mechanism that still allows microfinance platforms to use intermediaries, while removing the incentive to increase interest rates due to the transfer of risk to lenders"

2018-0019,3,"crowdfunding is a rather new phenomenon, so literature is still incipient"
2018-0019,4,this research aims to study crowdfunding as a financial instrument
2018-0019,5,"for this reason, we will focus specifically on crowdfunding that generates a financial return- i.e., peer-to-peer lending (p2p) and equity crowdfunding (ec)"
2018-0019,6,this article looks into the documents published in the tomson reuters web of science on the field of financial return crowdfunding
2018-0019,7,conclusions are drawn in terms of relevance of this burgeoning topic and suggestions for future research are put forward
2018-0056,0,financial technology (fintech) employs technological advancements and sharing economy models to improve financing services
2018-0056,1,the emergence of the internet-of-things (iot) has changed the way humans interact with the surrounding world
2018-0056,2,"in this paper, we present a proactive fintech model that uses the iot intelligence to deliver positive insurtech feedback"
2018-0056,3,"we propose an insurtech system with three main components: the monitoring and feedback device, the fog analytics engine, and the cloud server"
2018-0056,4,the driving analytics use sensor-recorded data to calculate in real time the driving scores based on current driving patterns and road conditions
2018-0056,5,the feedback device then communicates with drivers providing helpful feedbacks and potential rewards
2018-0056,6,"given assertive recommendations offered by a system, the rational-economic model suggests that humans usually respond positively to cost minimizations and rewards maximizations"
2018-0056,7,we have used real user data collected by the mapbar auto guard devices deployed in china to show an example of how iot supports the implementation of the positive feedback paradigm
2018-0056,8,we believe our proactive fintech model that speaks of actual costs and potential benefits in real time will offer an attractive service value and customer satisfaction
2018-0037,0,"with the rise of the concept of financial technology, financial and technology gradually in-depth integration, scientific and technological means to become financial product innovation, improve financial efficiency and reduce financial transaction costs an important driving force"
2018-0037,1,"in this context, the new technology platform is from the business philosophy, business model, technical means, sales, internal management and other dimensions to re-shape the financial industry"
2018-0037,2,"in this paper, the existing big data platform architecture technology innovation, adding space-time data elements, combined with the insurance industry for practical analysis, put forward a meaningful product circle and customer circle"
2018-0071,0,"this book gathers leading economic historians, geographers, and social scientists to focus on the developments in key international financial centres following the 2008 global financial crisis and to consider the likely effects of brexit on these centres"
2018-0071,1,"eleven centres in eight countries are taken into consideration: new york, london, frankfurt, paris, zurich/geneva, hong kong/shanghai/beijing, tokyo, and singapore"
2018-0071,2,the book addresses three main issues
2018-0071,3,"the first is the hierarchy of international financial centres, in particular whether asian financial centres have taken advantage of the crisis in the west"
2018-0071,4,"the second is the medium-term effects of the crisis, with respect to the volume of business activity (including employment), and the level of regulation, with concerns regarding the risks of regulatory overkill"
2018-0071,5,"and the third is the rise of new technology, known as fintech, possibly the most important change in the decade following the crisis, with questions as to whether it will render financial centres, as we know them, unnecessary for the functioning of the global economy, and which cities are likely to emerge as hubs of new financial technology"
2018-0071,6,"finally, the book discusses the likely effects of brexit on international financial centres, in particular london, paris, and frankfurt"
2018-0071,7,"the book takes a decidedly interdisciplinary approach, with a general introduction providing a global overview from a historical perspective, and a general conclusion providing a global overview from a geographical perspective"
2018-0071,8,its focus on the implications for global financial centres is unique among books about the aftermath of the global financial crisis
2018-0137,0,the manufacturer of payment fintech invests in research and development
2018-0137,1,"they absorb the technical knowledge of the competition collaborator, so as to build a combination with the technical skills"
2018-0137,2,"therefore, identifying the technical advantages among competing companies for the research and development, accumulating the technical core competence, as well as maintaining the competitive advantages are the important business topics for the manufacturer of payment fintech"
2018-0137,3,"from the viewpoint of patent statistics, this study forms the patent data collection after retrieval and analyzes it by using three patent statistics of technical attraction, technical relative position and relative patent advantages, in order to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the research and development portfolio for the payment fintech company in the industry"
2018-0076,0,our global market is emerging transformation strategy that can make the difference between success and failure
2018-0076,1,smart contract systems through developments of technological innovations are increasingly seen as alternative technologies to impact transactional processes significantly
2018-0076,2,blockchain is a smart contract protocol with trust offering the potential for creating new transaction platforms and thus shows a radical change of the current core value creation in third parties
2018-0076,3,these results in enormous cost and time savings and the reduced risk for the parties
2018-0076,4,this study proposed a method to improve the efficiency of distributed consensus in blockchains using epidemic algorithm
2018-0076,5,the results showed that epidemic protocols can distribute the information similar to blockchain
2018-0106,0,"as the world changes, financial sector changes with it, and alternative finance emerge"
2018-0106,1,crowdfunding is part of this evolution and its use is becoming more widespread day by day
2018-0106,2,"as more entrepreneurs and organizations seek crowdfunding to fund their ventures, and to solve the most important obstacle to achieve a successful crowdfunding campaign, which is not the information available about how to create a successful campaign, but rather its dispersion, it becomes of uttermost importance to create a framework to help them to succeed raising finance"
2018-0106,3,"it is, therefore, the main goal of this paper, to provide a valuable guide to help entrepreneurs in the hard task of raising finance through crowdfunding, mainly those using equity and reward crowdfunding"
2018-0106,4,"to accomplish the purposed goal, it is important to understand the underlying motivations of those investing in crowdfunding, in order to offer them what they seek and what motivates them"
2018-0106,5,it is also essential to identify which kind of crowdfunding fits better the entrepreneur's goals and which one increases the likelihood of achieving them
2018-0106,6,"finally, is crucial to understand the specific success factors for a successful crowdfunding campaign"
2018-0106,7,"one of the main findings of this work, is that the motivations for investors in equity and reward crowdfunding are similar"
2018-0106,8,"this is very important, since it solves the problem of the scarcity of data for the equity model"
2018-0106,9,"with similar motivations it is possible to apply the data available for reward crowdfunding to equity crowdfunding, since both campaign can be design to answer the same needs and motivations"
2018-0108,0,there is much hype about the potential for technological innovation (fintech) and big data to transform and deliver financial services to consumers
2018-0108,1,"the aim of this paper is to analyse, from the perspective of financial inclusion and consumer protection, the extent to which the current european union legal framework is prepared to respond to the challenges posed by such innovation in the context of the prospective opportunities and detriment for consumers"
2018-0108,2,"departing from an assessment of the already problematic and jeopardised uses of traditional credit data in the member states, it concludes that the risks are likely to contrast or outweigh the benefits, but the legal framework does not seem fit for purpose despite the enactment of brand new legislation"

2018-0182,0,big data in finance and the growth of large firms (bfv) investigate how big data is connected to firm size via the impact of bid data on cost of external financing
2018-0182,1,this short comment notes that big data may impact firm size directly via investment
2018-0026,0,two modern economic trends are the increase in firm size and advances in information technology
2018-0026,1,we explore the hypothesis that big data disproportionately benefits big firms
2018-0026,2,"because they have more economic activity and a longer firm history, large firms have produced more data"
2018-0026,3,"as processor speed rises, abundant data attracts more financial analysis"
2018-0026,4,"data analysis improves investors forecasts and reduces equity uncertainty, reducing the firm's cost of capital"
2018-0026,5,"when investors can process more data, large firm investment costs fall by more, enabling large firms to grow larger"
2018-0018,0,recent developments in the insurance industry embrace various insurance technology (insurtech) innovations
2018-0018,1,"to date, there is a lack of structured assessments of insurtech"
2018-0018,2,"prior research on fintech fails (1) to clarify how insurtech can be characterized and what capabilities are employed, and hence, (2) to reveal implications for value creation on firm and industry level"
2018-0018,3,we address this by inductively building a model of insurtech innovation adopting the grounded theory method
2018-0018,4,our empirical data includes 208 insurtech innovations from a market analysis based on twitter data and a multiple-case study
2018-0018,5,the resulting model comprises 52 characteristics and 14 transformational capabilities and is integrated with extant value networks and intermediation literature
2018-0018,6,the former explains how insurtech affects firm-level value creation and suggests that disruptive potentials emerge from aligning the transformational capabilities along three interdependent activities
2018-0018,7,the latter explains the entrance of digital intermediaries and their roles in the personal insurance market

2018-0031,0,i examine how credit reporting affects where firms access credit and how lenders contract with them
2018-0031,1,i use within firm-time and lender-time tests that exploit lenders joining a credit bureau and sharing information in a staggered pattern
2018-0031,2,"i find information sharing reduces relationship-switching costs, particularly for firms that are young, small, or have had no defaults"
2018-0031,3,"after sharing, lenders transition away from relationship contracting, in two ways: contract maturities in new relationships are shorter, and lenders are less willing to provide financing to their delinquent borrowers"
2018-0031,4,my results highlight the mixed effects of transparency-improving financial technologies on credit availability
2018-0029,0,retail banking has undergone a massive transformation in the last few years
2018-0029,1,a major aspect is changing consumer behavior
2018-0029,2,the aim of the paper is to better understand retail banking consumers regarding the impact of digitalization
2018-0029,3,"consequently, we acquired online consumer review data from germany, the uk and us"
2018-0029,4,"we analyzed the data using coding techniques of grounded theory, supported by interdisciplinary literature to identify and categorize the relevant influence factors"
2018-0029,5,the outcome of the paper is an integrated model of consumer decision-making in todays retail banking along with four detailed partial models of the respective decision stages
2018-0055,0,this paper draws on the resource-based view and risk-related research to examine imitation-related configurations that explain performance outcomes in social trading
2018-0055,1,"the study applies qualitative comparative analysis to examine 16,964 investment observations at etoro, the world's largest social trading platform"
2018-0055,2,"the results show that the experience and the imitation of traders, in combination with a low risk level, equifinally explain similar performance outcomes"
2018-0055,3,"the findings contribute to the literature on social trading and the resource-based view by exploring imitation as a valuable strategy, conceptualizing and empirically validating the role of risk in social trading, and drawing on qualitative comparative analysis to develop a more complex configurational understanding of the examined phenomenon"
2018-0008,0,the financial sector is facing radical transformation
2018-0008,1,"leveraging digital technologies to offer innovative services, fintech start-ups are emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance"
2018-0008,2,"despite increasing investments, the fintech phenomenon is low on theoretical insights"
2018-0008,3,"so far, the offerings of fintech start-ups have been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective"
2018-0008,4,"as a functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the offerings of fintech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional characteristics"
2018-0008,5,"thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented fintech start-ups"
2018-0008,6,"our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along the perspectives interaction, data, and monetization"
2018-0008,7,we demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227 fintech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a cluster analysis
2018-0008,8,"our taxonomy contributes to the descriptive knowledge on fintech start-ups, enabling researchers and practitioners to analyze the service offerings of fintech start-up in a structured manner"
2018-0080,0,"as mobile payments become increasingly popular, their ecosystem is also evolving"
2018-0080,1,"the participation of financial institutions in this ecosystem, although is rapidly improving, remains relatively low"
2018-0080,2,"this paper studies why some financial institutions choose to, or not to, participate in this nascent mobile payments ecosystem"
2018-0080,3,"we developed hypotheses for the influence of three factors as aspiration gaps, customer-facing it capabilities, and institutional pressures based on three theoretical foundations including the threat rigidity thesis, capability-based view, and institutional theory"
2018-0080,4,we then empirically tested our hypotheses by analyzing the diffusion of mobile payments among 3549 u.s
2018-0080,5,credit unions from 2013 to 2016
2018-0080,6,"results from our event history analyses provide support to the hypotheses that credit unions experiencing performance gaps, having superior customer-facing it capabilities, and facing strong institutional pressures are more likely to start providing mobile payment services"

2018-0181,0,"this chapter describes the analysis of a large crowdfunding platform to examine pledges to music production projects and assess the relation between the fundraising accumulation period, the donor-entrepreneur distance, and the donors' propensity to back projects"
2018-0181,1,"our results suggest a significantly negative association between distance and the value of capital pledged to projects, which is consistent with the notion that the entrepreneur's network of close contacts might play a central role in funding"
2018-0181,2,"furthermore, our results contradict the idea that crowdfunding reduces the inhibiting effect of donor-entrepreneur distance"
2018-0181,3,"in addition, the results show that a long project exposure is associated with higher values of pledges"
2018-0181,4,these results suggest practical implications for the study of crowdfunding as a financing platform
2018-0181,5,this study contributes to the literature on the use of crowdfunding as an alternative funding source in a major emerging market
2018-0124,0,"the banking sector has facing a new competitor, namely financial technology (fin-tech)"
2018-0124,1,fin-tech itself can be described as an industry composed of companies that use new technology and innovation with available resources in order to compete in the marketplace of traditional financial institutions and intermediaries in the delivery of financial services
2018-0124,2,"in indonesia, fin-tech has been widely developed in the past 3 years"
2018-0124,3,fin-tech is facing a new challenge as a new service for financial consumer which adapts new way of living in modern digital technology era
2018-0124,4,"basically, fin-tech is offering three main categories such as payment, personal finance and financing"
2018-0124,5,"in financing application there are peer to peer financing, social crowd funding and also loan marketplace"
2018-0124,6,"all of this kind application has some issues in legal framework and data protection due to the using of communication technologies such as internet, social networks, smartphone, massive use of data with the big data, connected objects etc"
2018-0124,7,"the using of big data and those new technologies have created new opportunities for these sectors, these developments also raise significant data protection concerns"
2018-0124,8,"this paper will discuss two legal issues of fin-tech, the legal aspect and the data protection"
2018-0082,0,the global financial services sector is transforming as technology advances
2018-0082,1,"various types of technology based innovative financial business models or financial technology (fin-tech) are growing rapidly around the world, including indonesia"
2018-0082,2,the financial stability board (fsb) incorporates the fin-tech progress in its work plan in 2017 in the perspective of financial stability
2018-0082,3,"in indonesia, the financial services authority has issued the financial services authority regulation no: 77/fsar.01/2016 on technology-based lending and borrowing services to provide a legal basis for fin-tech activities, in particular services with peer to peer lending models"
2018-0082,4,"in practice, fin-tech in indonesia is not only used to facilitate lending and borrowing, but also used for other business models, especially start-up business, investment and social activities, which are not included in the scope of lending and borrowing"
2018-0082,5,"on the other hand, fin-tech development in indonesia is expected to contribute to economic development, particularly in facilitating micro, small and medium enterprises to gain access to finance"
2018-0082,6,"the advantages of fin-tech include cost efficiency and ease of access to finance, but on the other hand there are some obstacles and risks that potentially arise, such as credit risk, insufficient technology, misuse of funds and user/consumer data and protection of national interests such as money laundering as well as disruption to monetary stability"
2018-0082,7,"therefore, in addition to the need for comprehensive regulation, supervisory aspects by the financial services authorities are urgently needed to make fin-tech a part of the financial services sector"
2018-0123,0,"the fintech business, which was initially focused on the payment sector, is becoming a global issue due to the entry of nonfinancial firms into the banking business"
2018-0123,1,"with the advent of the ""mobile age in your hand"", global ict companies are actively entering the banking business through alliances and competitions with existing financial companies"
2018-0123,2,"classifying the alliance companies of apple pay and samsung pay into the downstream alliance and the upstream alliance, this study analyzed the signaling effect of service opening and its impact on the firm value"
2018-0123,3,"to analyze the effect of a specific event on firm value, this study adopted the event study"
2018-0123,4,"additionally, ordinary least squares regression analysis was carried out to examine the influence of up- and downstream alliance on the firm value"
2018-0123,5,the result shows that apple pay's service launch in the usa
2018-0123,6,"has a positive impact on stock prices of up- and downstream alliance companies, providing new experience and satisfaction to users through active alliance with credit card companies"
2018-0123,7,"on the other hand, downstream alliance companies that showed a negative response to the launch of korean services turned to a positive response to usa service launch because to the difference in the specificity of credit card penetration rate and the portion of premium smartphones"
2018-0123,8,"analyzing the impact of the expansion of the service area toward the payment platform on the firm value, research results provide important implications for establishing technology management strategies to ensure the sustainability in rapidly changing technical advances by comparing the different market response of apple pay and samsung pay"
2018-0103,0,"the main directions, challenges, threats of digitization of the national economy of ukraine have been considered in the paper"
2018-0103,1,the attention is focused on the found weaknesses and the imperfection of the strategy and the state policy of digitization of ukraine's economy
2018-0103,2,the authors have proven the potential and new possibilities of solving public finance management problems with the usage of blockchain technology
2018-0103,3,it has been justified that activation of transformation processes in the real economy sector due to the introduction of industry 4.0 concept is important for ukraine
2018-0103,4,"the paper reveals basic principles and technologies, the experience of the european union, and characterizes industry 4.0 view in ukraine"
2018-0103,5,the development of the latest financial technologies-fintech-has been recognized as the driver of digital transformation of financial services
2018-0103,6,"the types of fintech innovations, the features of increasing competition between fintech companies and traditional financial intermediaries, the tendencies of fintech development in ukraine have been characterized"
2018-0194,0,"internet being a less cost advertisement and medium, had paved the way for tremendous and intensity of online and on time"
2018-0194,1,"however, while the anytime advertisement messages had been delivered, there had been limited studies on key variables such as irritation advertisement, customer complaint behavior, customer loyalty and relationship marketing"
2018-0194,2,this study examines the role of irritation advertisement and compliant behavior on customer loyalty by customers in banks and the mediating role relationship marketing plays in those relationships
2018-0194,3,"in this study, methods used questionnaires, including the irritation advertisement scale, compliant behavior scale, relationship marketing scale, and customer loyalty scale"
2018-0194,4,a total 300 questionnaires were administered in customers of banks in taiwan
2018-0194,5,"out of these 300 questionnaires, 265 responses were received, a return rate of 88.34%"
2018-0194,6,"after discarding invalid questionnaires, a total of 265 valid questionnaires, the rate of valid samples was 100%"
2018-0194,7,data had been analyzed using descriptive analysis and structural equation model
2018-0194,8,"finding that the mediated effect of relationship marketing on the relationships of irritation advertisement, compliant behavior and customer loyalty"
2018-0194,9,finally there were suggestions and managerial implications had been proposed
2018-0180,0,"the rapid development of internet technology at affordable costs raises new opportunities for micro, small and medium enterprises (smes) in various areas, especially in the use of financial technology services which directly and indirectly have helped sme performance"
2018-0180,1,"various studies in the field of information technology adoption have been carried out, but not much research found specifically examines the level of adoption of the financial technology system for sme's business development"
2018-0180,2,through this study researchers used the well known technology acceptance model (tam) framework which also considers technological risk factors for sme fintech users
2018-0180,3,a hundred and twenty seven respondents who were merchants offering mobile payment method in several shopping centers were chosen randomly
2018-0180,4,"the findings from this study recommends that mobile payment provider may focus on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use only, without orrying about perceived technology risk"
2018-0179,0,the growing and complex business processes and activities require banks to spearhead financial services or financial transaction flows to meet customer expectations
2018-0179,1,"the task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system"
2018-0179,2,"in addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data"
2018-0179,3,business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible
2018-0179,4,"similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible"
2018-0179,5,"especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy"
2018-0179,6,"as a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on soa (service oriented architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month"
2018-0179,7,the data required to create a composite report will be directly taken from the system of any bank by utilizing web services
2018-0179,8,"it is expected that the results from this study could help the parties interested in soa-based fin tech with the understanding and description of soa, such as: how it works, its benefits, and the role of soa layers implemented in fin tech applications"
2018-0091,0,this study explores the influence of trust and risk in the use of fintech in indonesian society
2018-0091,1,this exploration is based on findings from previous studies that suggest that trust and risk are important aspects in considering the use of fintech
2018-0091,2,the focus of this research is to develop and validate the research instruments that will be used next
2018-0091,3,the basic theory of model development uses the theory of technology acceptance model (tam) developed by davis
2018-0091,4,the models and instruments developed will be through pilot studies involving 133 communities as respondents
2018-0091,5,this study is quantitative research and data obtained were analyzed using smart pls v3.0
2018-0091,6,this analysis is conducted to ensure the level of reliability and validity of the instrument
2018-0091,7,the results of this analysis find 31 instruments that are stated reliable and validity
2018-0091,8,so it can be used for collecting data from a survey in accordance with the research
2018-0099,0,"despite limited financial resources of people with minimum wage in indonesia, they have embraced financial technology (fintech)"
2018-0099,1,"there are two types of fintech, i.e"
2018-0099,2,card-based electronic wallet and application-based digital cash
2018-0099,3,the aim of this research is to rank the acceptance factors of e-wallet and digital cash by low income individuals
2018-0099,4,"initially, systematic literature review (slr) was conducted to develop a structural hierarchy of the analytic hierarchy process (ahp)"
2018-0099,5,it was followed by interviews with fintech experts to validate the structural hierarchy
2018-0099,6,"finally, ahp pairwise comparison questionnaires were filled out by 18 respondents, who have experiences using electronic wallet or digital cash"
2018-0099,7,the results show that highest reception factor of both fintech types is ease of use
2018-0099,8,"speed is the second top rank acceptance factor of electronic wallet, whilst cost-benefit is the second factor of digital cash reception"
2018-0099,9,"these findings can enable fintech providers to improve their better marketing strategy, by enhancing their products related its ease of use, speed, and cost"
2018-0021,0,"the fintech revolution captures the simultaneous attack of a large number of technologies, notably mobile telephones and blockchain, which are ushering in efficiency or outreach to multiple niche markets"
2018-0021,1,"the use of mobile telephone technology has expanded internet reach to the excluded, created possibilities for business where banks were not historically present and is potentially disruptive"
2018-0021,2,the blockchain technology threatens to be even more disruptive as it may pull the carpet from under the monetary system as well as the property rights as we know them today
2018-0021,3,"the proliferation of actors and innovators has created a confused landscape resulting in different possible scenarios, where banks may freeze, fight, form alliances with challengers, or be forced into flight by the bigtech"
2018-0041,0,"in recent years, the new technological keywords, fintech and iot (internet of things) have attracted interest, and at the same time, as they have already become buzz words, a gap has appeared between technologies and services that will penetrate the market and those which will disappear"
2018-0041,1,recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies
2018-0041,2,"there is a requirement for fintech or iot to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself"
2018-0041,3,"while some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities"
2018-0041,4,"thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society"
2018-0041,5,"products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses"
2018-0041,6,this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation
2018-0041,7,"this paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples"
2018-0015,0,"mobile phones have provided such an enormous opportunity for financial development, and are anticipated to become a common tool for carrying out various financial transactions"
2018-0015,1,hundreds of mobile payment services have been introduced across the globe
2018-0015,2,"strikingly, many of these efforts have failed"
2018-0015,3,this study analyzes whether mobile payment is still relevant in the fintech era
2018-0015,4,"i compare three mobile payment projects  oi paggo in brazil, tcash in indonesia, and m-pesa in kenya  as case studies"
2018-0015,5,i argue that mobile payment systems currently operate in such complex and multidimensional networks with shared common infrastructures and compete for producing and providing value to the customers on the basis of these infrastructures
2018-0015,6,"three attributes of industry and network structure are immediately of interest: (1) cutting the vertical supply chain more finely may encourage large players to extend their domination, (2) the basic platform continues to be governed by multinational operators (mnos)  telecom firms, and (3) openness may be decreasing or increasing even as the number of independent parties in the supply chain drops"

2018-0035,0,"this book is a practical guide to the evolving landscape of finance, highlighting how it's changing our relationship with money and how financial technology, together with macroeconomic and societal change, is rewriting the story of how business is done in developing economies"
2018-0035,1,"financial services companies are trying to become more customer focused, but struggling to help huge customer segments, particularly in developing economies"
2018-0035,2,"alternative financial models and tools are emerging, which are being embraced by consumers and incumbents"
2018-0035,3,"in large parts of the developing world, alternative services are leapfrogging traditional finance, meaning more and more people have access to finance without ever needing a bank"
2018-0035,4,"meanwhile, the barriers around financial services companies are crumbling, as they become more reliant on integration with new providers and alternative types of service"
2018-0035,5,"financial products can no longer be viewed in isolation, but as part of a service landscape that supports how people do life"
2018-0035,6,"this means rethinking how our businesses are designed, motivated and organised, and letting go of the old ways of thinking about supply and demand"
2018-0035,7,"with practical steps businesses and, in particular, financial services organisations need to take to participate in a global service ecosystem, this book will be of interest to financial professionals who work in banking, financial technology, and development finance"
2018-0130,0,this paper propose qualified near field communication antenna by lds (laser direct structuring) type with a via-hole balun on mobile or wearable system to support fintech (financial technology) application
2018-0116,0,"to keep the planet on the 2c trajectory, developing countries alone will require us$500 billion annually by 2030 to adequately mitigate their carbon emissions, in addition to several hundred billion additional dollars for adaptation needs"
2018-0116,1,the us$100 billion a year pledged by developed countries through the green climate fund is such insufficient that most of the climate finance required will have to come from the private sector
2018-0116,2,"as a scene-setting chapter, it will delineate the scale of climate investment required, the state of climate finance post-paris agreement, climate mitigation and adaptation investment trends, global climate finance landscape, specific hurdles against climate investment, and the problems with climate finance tracking and monitoring"
2018-0116,3,the lack of trust and transparency in the global climate finance landscape provides an excellent ground on which to deploy blockchain technology to turbo-boost global climate finance flows
2018-0116,4,"this chapter will initiate the discussion on how blockchain as a ""trust machine"" could address the many deeply-rooted institutional problems"
2018-0140,0,mobile money platforms are gaining traction across developing markets as a convenient way of sending and receiving money over mobile phones
2018-0140,1,recent joint collaborations between banks and mobile-network operators leverage a customers past mobile phone transactions in order to create a credit score for the individual
2018-0140,2,"in this work, we address the problem of launching a mobile-phone based credit scoring system in a new market without the marginal distribution of features of borrowers in the new market"
2018-0140,3,this challenge rules out traditional transfer learning approaches such as a direct covariate shift
2018-0140,4,we apply a market-based re-weighting scheme of original market borrowers that accounts for the differences in the original and new markets
2018-0140,5,the goal of applying this generalized covariate shift to three populations is to understand the repayment behavior of a fourth: new market borrowers who will self-select into a loan product when it becomes available
2018-0140,6,"to test the approach we use real-world data sets from two sub-saharan countries in africa consisting of 200,000 customers telephone records"
2018-0140,7,our results demonstrate that the market-based re-weighting scheme improves the credit scoring model in the new market compared to other more direct methods
2018-0100,0,this paper aims to explore any possibilities or any chance the happening collaborative and disruptive between financial technology (fintech) and bank with the focus on peer to peer (p2p) model
2018-0100,1,we describe how financial innovations p2p model may have the possibility to disturb the financial system and analyze the collaborative model between bank and fintech in indonesia
2018-0100,2,"the method of this study is literature review in which we combine the theoretical perspective, lesson learned from some countries and indonesias experience"
2018-0100,3,we find that the collaboration model is feasible with some requirement
2018-0196,0,"the lack of innovation in financial services can be explained by the market domination and regulatory protection that incumbent banks have hitherto enjoyed, meaning that they have not needed to defend disruptive forces from fintechs, third parties or other banks"
2018-0196,1,"however, the era of lightweight innovation and limited advancements in payments technology is coming to an end"
2018-0196,2,"the revised payments services directive (psd2) gives third parties the opportunity to develop, launch and become the preferred payments channel in regions where no alternative exists"
2018-0196,3,increasing smartphone adoption and internet access will see mobile become the dominant channel for everyday purchases
2018-0196,4,"as payments are commoditised, the value of this channel is no longer limited to transaction fees"
2018-0196,5,"instead, it is derived from user volume and data.tech giants, such as facebook, google and apple, recognise that data equal power and have made evidential steps toward becoming payment powerhouses"
2018-0196,6,banks bring formidable strengths to the payments arena
2018-0196,7,there are considerable benefits and revenue sources available to those that mobilise their long-term payment channels
2018-0196,8,partnering with fintechs allows banks to quickly become agile and launch cost-efficient minimum viable products and to test new ideas
2018-0196,9,"to retain relevance in payments post-psd2, banks must make mobile payments their top priority"
2018-0128,0,the rapid development of fintech services and a growing number of smart devices is changing the face of the payments world
2018-0128,1,"nowadays, the financial services are accessed by almost anyone, anywhere, anytime via smartphones or tablets"
2018-0128,2,"this article aims to investigate the effects of technology, personal and environment on intention towards the intention to use mobile payment system in vietnam, based on a technology acceptance model (tam) and technology, personal and environment (tpe) framework"
2018-0128,3,"the proposed model consists three technical factors, three personal factors, and one environmental factor"
2018-0128,4,"users perceived ease of use is the strongest influenced by mobile payment knowledge, whereas personal innovativeness is the most influential factor to the usefulness of mobile payment"
2018-0128,5,"interestingly, the results indicate that perceived cost and compatibility have insignificant effects over the perceived usefulness"
2018-0128,6,"moreover, the relationships between the variables are influenced by gender and occupation"

2018-0050,0,crowdlending and crowdinvesting have experienced rapid growth in some eu member states
2018-0050,1,"however, these types of crowdfunding have, for the most part, remained a phenomenon of those larger member states that draw a crowd, with populations that are large enough to make crowdfunding systems economically feasible"
2018-0050,2,"in turn, crowdfunding has remained a mainly national issue, prompting the european commission to conclude that there is no need for harmonization of crowdfunding rules in europe"
2018-0050,3,"in contrast to the european commissions capital market action plan, this paper takes the view that national limitations on crowdinvesting and crowdlending de facto are the result of limits de iure"
2018-0050,4,"given that no european passport is tailor made or fits crowdfunding, this source of financing is doomed to remain national"
2018-0050,5,"moreover, with different legal requirements in member states, european law hinders the development of cross-border crowdfunding within the region"
2018-0050,6,this is particularly true for smaller member states whose populations are too small to constitute a crowd
2018-0050,7,this paper details how european regulators could facilitate a single european crowdfunding market
2018-0050,8,"regulation of the crowdfunding platform based on the mifid light framework could function as the basis for a cross-border crowdfunding manager passport, given the minimum protection it affords both investors and the financial system, and the low costs it imposes on the platform"
2018-0050,9,"following the (1) too-small-to-care, (2) too-large-to-ignore, and (3) too-big-to-fail development path of fintech business models, we suggest adding a relevance threshold of eur250,000 in transaction volume to the mifid light framework and imposing regulation to address systemic risk stemming from very large crowdfunding platforms"

2018-0120,1,"the company goes by the tagline, power for everyone"
2018-0120,2,"using mobile payments system and an innovative approach to energy delivery, m-kopa succeeded in building a business which solved a grave problem for the poorest of the poor and has the potential to become a billion dollar enterprise"
2018-0120,3,the case begins with a description of the background in which m-kopa is operating
2018-0120,4,it goes on to explain how m-kopa used the infrastructure gap in sub-saharan africa as an opportunity and propagated solar power as an alternative to traditional energy
2018-0120,5,"finally, it lays out the challenges m-kopa may face on its expansion spree"
2018-0016,0,the financial crisis of 2008 has led to dramatic changes in the way that finance is regulated: the dodd-frank act imposed broad and systemic regulation on the industry on a level not seen since the new deal
2018-0016,1,but the financial regulatory reforms enacted since the crisis have been premised on an outdated idea of what financial services look like and how they are provided
2018-0016,2,"regulation has failed to take into account the rise of financial technology (or ""fintech"") firms and the fundamental changes they have ushered in on a variety of fronts, from the way that banking works, to the way that capital is raised, even to the very form of money itself"
2018-0016,3,these changes call for a wide-ranging reconceptualization of financial regulation in an era of technology-enabled finance
2018-0016,4,"in particular, this article argues that regulators' focus on preventing the risks associated with ""too big to fail"" institutions overlooks the conceptually distinct risks associated with small, decentralized financial markets"
2018-0016,5,"in many ways, these risks can be greater than those presented by large institutions because decentralized fintech markets are more vulnerable to adverse economic shocks, less transparent to regulators, and more likely to encourage excessively risky behavior by market participants"

2018-0111,0,many expect smart contracts (sc's) to disrupt the way contracts are done implying that sc have the potential to affect all commercial relationships
2018-0111,1,sc's are automatization tools
2018-0111,2,"therefore, proponents claim that sc's can reduce transaction costs through disintermediation and risk reduction"
2018-0111,3,"this is an over-simplification of the role of relationships, contract law, and risk"
2018-0111,4,we believe there is a gap in the understanding of the capabilities of sc's
2018-0111,5,"with that in mind we seek to define an amorphous term and clarify the capabilities of sc's, intending to facilitate future sc research"
2018-0111,6,"we've examined the legal, technical, and is views from an academic and practitioner's perspective"
2018-0111,7,"we conclude that sc's have taken many forms, becoming a suitcase word for any sort of code stored on a blockchain, including the embodiment of contractual terms"
2018-0111,8,and that the immutable nature of sc's is a barrier to their adoption in uncertain and multi-contextual environments

2018-0113,2,"in addition, the underlying technology innovation may be applied to a wide range of industries, not limited to financial sector"
2018-0113,3,"yet, few researches have been done to study these phenomena"
2018-0113,4,"hence, it is the task of this book to shed light on the introduction and trends in fintech, blockchain and token sales"
2018-0113,5,"richly illustrated with original lecture slides taught by the authors, inclusive fintech: blockchain, cryptocurrency and ico hopes to dispel the many misconceptions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies (especially bitcoin, initial crypto-token offering or ico), as well as the idea that businesses can be sustainable without a social dimension going forward"

2018-0153,4,"data and consumer protection issues, risk of exacerbating financial volatility and cybercrime) and has been increasingly attracting political attention at the supranational level"
2018-0153,5,"thus, the fundamental question of this paper is: how is the european union dealing with fintech? due to the broad scope of fintech, eu regulators face a dilemma: on the one hand, rule-based regulatory frameworks set out compliance obligations clearly, but these are often expensive from a start-up perspective and could be an obstacle to innovation and job creation"
2018-0153,6,"on the other hand, principle-based regulation is more flexible, but could create some uncertainty as to what exactly is expected in terms of compliance"
2018-0153,7,a possible middle ground could be found by evolving towards a more dialectic supervisory model
2018-0163,0,"in this paper, we present experiences from eight years of developing a financial transaction engine, using what can be described as an integration-test-centric software development process"

2018-0073,1,"so-called fintech disruptors are aggressively tapping into their service delivery chain to offer clients a better (cheaper, more convenient or efficient) value proposition"
2018-0073,2,"as banks have subsequently been forced to think more strategically about how to conduct themselves due to the imminent use of, for example, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, biometrics and big data, regulators have simultaneously had to ensure that the pervasiveness of technological disruption does not threaten the soundness of banks and the stability of economies"
2018-0073,3,aim: to identify the strategic implications of fintech on south african retail banks
2018-0073,4,setting: the study is conducted in the south african retail banking industry

2018-0073,7,"secondly, interaction policy is migrating clients towards a remote-based distribution strategy"
2018-0073,8,"thirdly, the bank of the future will not rely as heavily on brick-and-mortar branches as it has in the past"
2018-0073,9,"fourthly, new competitors are entering the fray and offer competitive digital-only solutions"
2018-0073,10,"finally, given the innovation and growth shown by these disruptors, financial sector regulators will have to find ways to hold them accountable"
2018-0073,11,"conclusion: by adapting to the fintech revolution, south african retail banks are hoping to become strategically pre-emptive rather than merely proactive"

2018-0049,3,"financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world"
2018-0049,4,"in this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest"
2018-0049,5,"moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks"
2018-0049,6,"the emergence of fintech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society"

2018-0166,0,banking is at an inflection point
2018-0166,1,most people think that banking is being reshaped by regulations since the global financial crisis but that is only half the story
2018-0166,2,the other half is about technology
2018-0166,3,the multi-trillion-dollar financial services industry is being digitally disrupted and digitally re-imagined
2018-0166,4,the global financial crisis resulted in a debate on the 'too-big-to-fail' banks but it also created a 'too-small-to-care' crisis for small businesses as banks scaled back their lending to the sme sector
2018-0166,5,marketplace lending platforms are supporting financial inclusion and providing the much needed access to capital to small businesses that have traditionally been the goldilocks of digital banking

2018-0224,1,the biggest problems of the digital signature technologies are delegation/lending/duplication
2018-0224,2,"in this study, we propose a new approach method which use the tee area in the smart phones and it based on non-face-to-face identification and digital signature method"
2018-0224,3,suggested method is requiring no specific device except smart phones
2018-0224,4,the biometric information and personal data of the user are stored in the safe tee within the smart phone
2018-0224,5,"in our method, the key generation and digital signature are also, conducted in tee, we can prevent to various types of attack including sniffing and man-in-the-middle attack"
2018-0224,6,"also, because all of the processes are conducted in tee, the all transactions can be protected against malicious users"
2018-0013,0,purpose: the purpose of this paper is to better understand why people are willing or hesitant to use financial technology (fintech) as well as to determine whether the effect of perceived benefits and risks of continuance intention differs depending on user types
2018-0013,1,design/methodology/approach: original data were collected via a survey of 243 participants with fintech usage experience
2018-0013,2,the partial least squares method was used to test the proposed model
2018-0013,3,"findings: the results reveal that legal risk had the most negative effect on the fintech continuance intention, while convenience had the strongest positive effect"
2018-0013,4,differences in specific benefit and risk impacts are found between early and late adopters
2018-0013,5,originality/value: this empirical study contributes to the novel understanding of the benefit and risk factors affecting the fintech continuance intention
2018-0022,0,"finance startups are offering automated advice, touchless payments, and other products that could bring great societal benefits, including lower prices and expanded access to credit"
2018-0022,1,"yet unlike in other digital arenas in which american companies are global leaders, such as search engines and ride hailing, the united states lags in consumer financial technology"
2018-0022,2,this article posits that the current competition policy framework is holding back consumer financial innovation
2018-0022,3,it then identifies a contributor missing from the literature: the institutional design of federal regulators
2018-0022,4,competition authority-including antitrust and the extension of business licenses-is spread across at least five agencies
2018-0022,5,each is focused on other missions or industries
2018-0022,6,"the department of justice (doj), hindered by statutes and knowledge gaps, devotes significantly fewer resources to banking than to other industries in merger review because it leans heavily on prudential regulators"
2018-0022,7,"the federal reserve and other prudential regulators prioritize financial stability, which conflicts with their competition mandate"
2018-0022,8,"no agency has the right authority, motivation, and expertise to promote consumer financial competition"
2018-0022,9,"innovation has raised the stakes for fixing this structural flaw in finance, and potentially in other heavily regulated industries"
2018-0022,10,"if allowed to compete fully, financial technology challengers (""fintechs"") could bring large consumer welfare advances and reduce the size of ""too big to fail"" banks, thereby lessening the chances of a financial crisis"
2018-0022,11,"if allowed to grow unchecked, fintechs or the big banks acquiring them may reach the kind of digital market dominance seen in google, facebook, and amazon, thereby increasing systemic risk"
2018-0022,12,"whether the goal is to benefit consumers, strengthen markets, or prevent crises, a reallocation of competition authority would better position regulators to navigate the future of innovation"
2018-0177,0,"recent technological developments have enabled a wide array of new applications in financial markets, e.g"
2018-0177,1,"big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, and robo-advising, inter alia"
2018-0177,2,"while traditionally comprising of computer programs and other technology used to support or enable banking and financial services, the new fintech sector is often seen as enabling transformation of the financial industry"
2018-0177,3,"a more moderate and critical view suggests that for the full transformative potential of fintech to be enabled, there is a need for an updated educational curriculum that balances knowledge and understanding of finance and technology"
2018-0177,4,a curriculum that provides a skill portfolio in the two core components and complements them with applied knowledge can support the enabling forces which will render fintech as a true opportunity for the financial service industry and for society as a whole
2018-0177,5,"we attempt a scholarship inquiry into the educational curriculum in finance and technology, aiming to inform this modern educational agenda"
2018-0177,6,"we review skills shortages, as identified by firms and experts, and examine the state-of-the art by some of the first educational programs in fintech"
2018-0027,0,purpose: the purpose of this study is to empirically analyse the key factors that influence the adoption of financial technology innovation in the country germany
2018-0027,1,the advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (fintech) innovation
2018-0027,2,"financial sectors and startups see fintech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities"
2018-0027,3,mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and fintech innovators
2018-0027,4,"in this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt fintech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and fintech promotion"
2018-0027,5,"the empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of fintech"
2018-0027,6,existing studies have used the technology acceptance model (tam) to address this issue
2018-0027,7,the outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of fintech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity
2018-0027,8,"design/methodology/approach: in this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting fintech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and fintech promotion"
2018-0027,9,"the results confirm that customer trust, data security and the user design interface affect the adoption of fintech"
2018-0027,10,"this research proposes a model called intention to adopt fintech in germany, constructs of which were developed based on the tam and five additional components, as identified"
2018-0027,11,the outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of fintech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity
2018-0027,12,findings: the authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in germany is rapidly increasing
2018-0027,13,yet the adoption of fintech is extremely sluggish
2018-0027,14,"it is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized fintech"
2018-0027,15,"further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used fintech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents"
2018-0027,16,it is obvious that the fintech incubators and banks offering fintech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of fintech
2018-0027,17,this study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke fintech adoption
2018-0027,18,research limitations/implications: there are a few limitations in this study
2018-0027,19,"initially, this study focuses on fintech implementation in germany and not the whole of europe"
2018-0027,20,"in addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use fintech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology"
2018-0027,21,"without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the fintech adoption process"
2018-0027,22,future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model
2018-0027,23,"additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the german population"
2018-0027,24,"to accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential"
2018-0027,25,the authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to fintech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies
2018-0027,26,"practical implications: this study was conducted in germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment"
2018-0027,27,"for instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the united kingdom, where take-up of fintech appears to be far greater than in germany"
2018-0027,28,"therefore, the authors results are only generalized for the country of germany and not other geographical areas"
2018-0027,29,"furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about fintech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions"
2018-0027,30,"in spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and fintech services experience"
2018-0027,31,"the authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability"
2018-0027,32,"accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on fintech use"
2018-0027,33,social implications: the outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of fintech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity
2018-0027,34,"the authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage fintech innovators in their approach to fintech and enable fintech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future"
2018-0027,35,"originality/value: a considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (it) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in it remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (carlson, 2015)"
2018-0027,36,most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance it
2018-0057,0,purpose: this paper aims to demonstrate the importance of a cash flow generating standard for individual financial contract level data and the ability to create such a standard
2018-0057,1,design/methodology/approach: the authors analyze the importance for such a standard of software that turns natural language contracts into cash flow generating algorithms
2018-0057,2,a data dictionary that standardizes contract terms
2018-0057,3,and access to variables that represent the state of the world (e.g
2018-0057,4,"market risk, counterparty risk, etc.) that affect contractual obligations"
2018-0057,5,findings: the ability to realize benefits from the use of such a contract level algorithmic standard depends on the following: making the standards software open source
2018-0057,6,fully testing the software to have complete confidence in its accuracy
2018-0057,7,"and enabling the software to use of a wide range of models of various sources of risk (market, credit and behavior risk) to support forward-looking analysis"
2018-0057,8,such a standard would solve the disconnect that exists in financial firms between the representation of financial contracts for transaction processing and analysis
2018-0057,9,"the actus financial research foundation is building, testing and making available such a standard that represents almost all financial contracts extant in markets"
2018-0057,10,"practical implications: the adoption of such a standard would reduce the costs of operations of financial firms, provide the computational infrastructure for more effective regulatory oversight, reduce regulatory reporting costs and improve financial market transparency"
2018-0057,11,it would also enable the assessment of systemic risk by directly quantifying the interconnectedness of firms
2018-0057,12,"originality/value: this is a new approach to financial analytics that clearly separates the deterministic components of finance, which can be standardized from the stochastic elements that cannot be standardized"
2018-0225,0,purpose: this paper aims to review the latest management developments across the globe and pinpoint practical implications from cutting-edge research and case studies
2018-0225,1,design/methodology/approach: this briefing is prepared by an independent writer who adds their own impartial comments and places the articles in context
2018-0225,2,findings: hong kong is a global financial center and the key to finance in china and asia
2018-0225,3,"to keep its place in the global financial market, hong kong is looking to support the growing fintech market but with caution to avoid a repeat of 2008"
2018-0225,4,"originality/value: the briefing saves busy executives, strategists and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy-to-digest format"
2018-0025,0,the financial industry is seeing rapid introduction of new technologies and new business models that are challenging established practices
2018-0025,1,recent changes in financial regulation in the united states have spurred evolution of equity crowdfunding as a potential alternative to traditional sources of venture capital
2018-0025,2,"to address the relative lack of knowledge about success factors, we focus on title iii equity crowdfunding platforms in the united states that are open to non-accredited investors"
2018-0025,3,"we draw on traditional venture finance research and we examine the effects of market, execution and agency risks in equity crowdfunding under title iii"
2018-0025,4,we collect data on 133 ventures that attracted more than $11 million in funding commitments across sixteen title iii equity crowdfunding platforms
2018-0025,5,we find that all three types of risks can affect the likelihood of successful fundraising under title iii
2018-0025,6,"we discuss the implications of these findings for entrepreneurs, investors, crowdfunding platforms and policy makers"
2018-0226,0,"this paper discusses the role and usage of traditional and non-traditional consumer data in the retail financial markets of the european union in the context of the economic theories, policies, and law within which they work"
2018-0226,1,"across europe there is no common practice of using the credit data of consumers, which can be exploited for several purposes"
2018-0226,2,"traditionally, they are used by the lending industry as a risk-management tool to underwrite borrowing decisions or price risks, but they can also be used as a practice of creditworthiness assessment"
2018-0226,3,"in some member states, consumer data are part of a broader information centralisation system for the prudential supervision of banks and the financial system as a whole"
2018-0226,4,"within this already complex picture, emerging technologies and the processing of new generations of personal data are starting to give way to new business models that can transform retail financial markets (fintechs)"
2018-0226,5,"whatever the function the data perform, their source, type, breath, and depth differ greatly from country to country"
2018-0226,6,"unlike for the harmonisation of eu rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonised legal framework"
2018-0226,7,"likewise, the establishment of the banking union and the prudential supervision of the euro-area demand standardisation and convergence of the data used to measure debt levels, arrears, and delinquencies"
2018-0226,8,"the many functions and different usages of credit data suggest that the policy goals to be achieved should inform the design and structure of the databases, as well as the role, legal, and institutional framework of the organisations managing the data system (the data brokers)"
2018-0226,9,"this is also because fundamental rights and consumer protection concerns arise from the dissemination and sharing of traditional and non-traditional data, as well as from their expanding uses"
2018-0226,10,this is an area of the eu internal market that demands the attention of the eu legislator without further delays
2018-0161,0,"as fintech technology has been developed, innovative financial services are being offered"
2018-0161,1,"among them, mobile easy remittance service is spreading in a vast speed"
2018-0161,2,"the mobile easy remittance service is a service that simplifies the remittance process by replacing the id, password, certificate, and secret card authentication procedures required for the conventional online or mobile remittance service with fingerprint recognition"
2018-0161,3,"de-spite the convenience of the mobile easy remittance service, the number of ongoing users is low and the users are limited to the 20s"
2018-0161,4,"in this study, the acceptance factors of mobile easy remittance service are analyzed using tam (technology acceptance model) model for 193 mobile easy remittance service users"
2018-0161,5,"as a result, perceived usefulness has been found to be the most influential factor in the acceptance of the mobile easy remittance service"
2018-0161,6,perceived ease of use and social influence also have been found to be acceptance factors to use the service
2018-0078,0,"this chapter explores the operational risks raised by the use of common 'grassroots' open-source software practices in public blockchains, such as bitcoin and ethereum, in their potential role as financial market infrastructures"
2018-0078,1,"these practices include the informal software development process, problematic funding for software development, and the possibility of forking inherent to open-source software"
2018-0078,2,the paper argues that the risks raised by these practices significantly undermine public blockchains' suitability to serve as financial market infrastructures
2018-0078,3,"further, they herald the need to reevaluate the use of these practices outside the blockchain technology setting, in other critical infrastructures based on grassroots open-source software"
2018-0001,0,fintech brings about a new paradigm in which information technology is driving innovation in the financial industry
2018-0001,1,"fintech is touted as a game changing, disruptive innovation capable of shaking up traditional financial markets"

2018-0001,5,"finally, technical and managerial challenges for both fintech startups and traditional financial institutions are discussed"
2017-0023,0,fintech innovations-innovations by financial services providers based on digital technology-are widely believed to have a disruptive effect on the financial services industry
2017-0023,1,the purpose of the paper is to investigate how financial services industry participants perceive the effect of digital disruption as well as to explore what strategies are being adopted by incumbents in the face of potential disruption from fintech challengers
2017-0023,2,"based on an exploratory study with stakeholders from the financial ecosystem in the middle east and north africa (mena), the findings show that the fintech sector is still nascent, but is likely to be disruptive in selected product and customer segments"
2017-0023,3,"multiple regulatory, structural, and cultural obstacles stand in the way of fintech adoption"
2017-0023,4,"incumbents preferred strategy to face the future disruption is the bank-fintech collaboration, which will create new value for ecosystem partners and speed up innovation"
2017-0023,5,our study adds useful insights to the body of knowledge related to disruptive innovations in general and fintech in emerging markets in particular
2017-0023,6,"specifically, the collaborative response is inconsistent with the strategies usually recommended for incumbents in disruptive innovation theory"
2017-0023,7,we hypothesize that our participants preference for partnering can be explained in the light of the distinctive characteristics of the digital economy
2017-0023,8,we propose a framework for creating a financial services platform embedded in a broader ecosystem to facilitate the bank-fintech collaboration
2017-0070,0,"the question of the role of blockchain technology, a decentralized and distributed digital ledger, in the financial services market is only now being addressed with the technology in its infancy"
2017-0070,1,"subsequent work primarily focused on the cryptocurrency, bitcoin, because its creator, programmer satoshi nakamoto first published a white paper and coded what is now known as blockchain technology to solve the double spending problem"
2017-0070,2,"more recently, blockchain technology has made significant advances in the fields of insurance, medical records, and the internet of things (iot)"
2017-0070,3,"however, the power of blockchain technology to solve problems in and serve as a replacement ledger of transactions in financial services will fundamentally transform the finance industry"
2017-0070,4,this paper attempts to address the challenges that blockchain technology will encounter by focusing on the methodology of using blockchain technology to solve problems in the financial services market with special attention to the use of decentralization and peer-to-peer transactions
2017-0070,5,"specifically, this project will be examining the use of blockchain technology to drive the changes in the field of financial services"
2017-0070,6,"this paper will also discuss the future role of blockchain technology in teaching the various fields of finance, and juxtapose them against traditional teaching methods in finance, in order to reveal the increasing role that blockchain technology will play in the 21st-century financial services curriculum"
2017-0070,7,"this paper argues that indeed, blockchain technology will be able to increasingly affect how we solve various financial services problems and that this development will profoundly change the way the finance curriculum is taught in the classroom"
2017-0070,8,"in conclusion, this project, by closely examining the role of blockchain technology, sheds new light on the rapidly developing changes in the financial services field"
2017-0017,0,background: this study aims to clarify the role of fintech digital banking start-ups in the financial industry
2017-0017,1,we examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent us retail banks for 2010 to 2016
2017-0017,2,"methods: to capture the importance of fintech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals"
2017-0017,3,we relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods
2017-0017,4,results: our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in fintech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks
2017-0017,5,"conclusions: although these results suggest complementarity between fintech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant"
2017-0017,6,"since the fintech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious"

2017-0049,0,"in recent years, online invoice trading has gained importance in providing smes with short-term financing"
2017-0049,1,"in this paper, we present first empirical evidence concerning the question whether the risk of payment difficulties is appropriately reflected in the pricing variables"
2017-0049,2,"to this end, we investigate predictors of default of online invoice trading platforms"
2017-0049,3,"we analyze both the probability of default and the loss rate and find that the interest rate, the duration and the percentage funded have good predictive power"
2017-0049,4,"furthermore, we show that the pricing mechanism (auction vs"
2017-0049,5,fixed prices) helps to explain defaults on online invoice trading platforms

2017-0059,1,we assess how security is treated by startups that provide disruptive technologies in the financial sector
2017-0059,2,"in an area that has been committed to security, we find that fintech companies have modern designs and outstanding user experience as their main priority"
2017-0059,3,"this strategy is rewarded by a rapidly increasing customer base but reveals a flawed understanding of security.we analyzed all aspects of security of n26, including the frontend, backend, protocols, human factors, and underlying design concepts, and found issues in all of them"
2017-0059,4,"we succeeded in leaking customer data, manipulating and carrying transactions and even could have entirely taken over foreign accounts"
2017-0059,5,we reported these findings to n26 and did not disclose them before they were fixed
2017-0059,6,"by publishing this case study, we hope to raise awareness about security considerations in the critical banking sector, especially for other fintech startups"

2017-0009,1,"digital finance technologies, including blockchain, have empowered a type of crescive entrepreneurship that seeks opportunities in relation to financially excluded individuals"
2017-0009,2,"this article hypothesizes that nonmonetary causal factors and informal financial practices play a major role in habits of the financially excluded, which would favor blockchain's disintermediation features over the incumbent approach"
2017-0009,3,"after applying fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) to determine the conditions related to financial practice and motivations that explain the absence of a formal bank account, i prescribe five sensitivities that blockchain entrepreneurs need to consider when targeting this segment"
2017-0009,4,"the value of this article's approach extends well beyond traditional unisystemic views for financial inclusion, as blockchain-based entrepreneurial opportunities emerge to reveal alternative forms of disintermediated financial services, which we exemplify in startups modeling informal practices"
2017-0009,5,blockchain entrepreneurship can generate semi-formal financial services that bring financial aspirations closer to people
2017-0009,6,my perspective is relevant to blockchain entrepreneurs who aim to understand the practices of the unbanked as source information for the development of innovative solutions

2017-0067,6,"and, as fintech is very often associated with the omnipresent discussion about crypto currencies and blockchain, we'll take a look at that too"
2017-0067,7,in discussions and in keynotes the word blockchain is also used as a buzzword
2017-0067,8,"everyone else seems to hop on the same train, leaving it pretty unclear what it actually means or does - what blockchain is"

2017-0020,0,benefit distribution in payments for ecosystem services (pes) and redd+ involves the disbursement of cash or in-kind incentives to local participants that opt to manage their land in ways that increase or maintain ecosystem service provision
2017-0020,1,"for decades, existing benefit distribution approaches have been debated by academics, and presented challenges for conservation practitioners"
2017-0020,2,"in passing through long chains of project actors, payments incur high transaction costs and are susceptible to elite capture and corruption"
2017-0020,3,"a new type of financial technology (fintech)  mobile money  could offer a novel and available solution to these challenges, at what is now a critical stage in pes and redd+ implementation"
2017-0020,4,"mobile payments (made via cell phones) have been used successfully in development projects related to micro-credit, micro-insurance, and aid relief, and this commentary considers their possible advantages and drawbacks for pes/redd+ schemes"
2017-0020,5,several countries e.g
2017-0020,6,"cambodia, china, tanzania, and the philippines demonstrate both high pes/redd+ uptake, and high mobile money penetration"
2017-0020,7,"in certain circumstances benefit distribution via fintech may lower transaction costs, enable higher frequency payments, and provide new socioeconomic benefits"

2017-0045,0,"disrupting traditional financial models and businesses, fintech integrates both finance and technology, provides an array of innovative business services, and leads the revolution of global economy"
2017-0045,1,"nowadays, main business models in fintech are thirdparty payment, peer-to-peer (p2p) lending, and crowd-funding"
2017-0045,2,p2p lending is the work of lending money to individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises through online services that match lenders and borrowers directly within websites
2017-0045,3,"the matching considers risks and requirements of both lenders and borrowers, offers lenders with attractive return rates and credit worthy borrowers, and provides the service more cheaply than traditional financial institutions with lower overhead and threshold"
2017-0045,4,"hence, p2p lending is the key and an important trend of fintech"
2017-0045,5,"however, without financial institutions, p2p lending will cause risk management problems including credit risk, business risk, and market risk"
2017-0045,6,"unfortunately, no adequate regulation are provided to protect the unsecure personal loan due to the rapid progress and beyond the laws"

2017-0063,0,providers who combine digital technologies with financial services in an innovative manner (fintech companies) have been increasingly entering financial markets and taking over established financial intermediaries' economic functions or parts of their value chain
2017-0063,1,"this is relentlessly projected to affect competition in some parts of the financial system and to impact its structure and dynamics, calling upon policy- and law-makers to take a close look at the financial stability implications"
2017-0063,2,"the aim of this paper is to develop a theoretical framework to aid supervisors, policy- and law-makers in managing risks and harnessing opportunities arising from the transition to the ""fintech era"""
2017-0063,3,"until now, ""fintech"" has been vaguely associated with concepts like ""disruption"", ""decentralisation"" and ""disintermediation"""
2017-0063,4,very little efforts have been spent on explaining the relevance of each of them
2017-0063,5,"departing from the prevailing current, this paper deploys such concepts as filters in risk-profiling fintech"
2017-0063,6,"according to our model, we identify four filters (economic function, disruptive potential, disintermediation, and decentralisation) against which to categorise ""fintech"""
2017-0063,7,the output of the filtering process is intended to facilitate the examination of questions relating to policy and regulatory responses
2017-0050,0,"traditionally, security and economics functionalities in it financial services and protocols (fintech) have been perceived as separate objectives"
2017-0050,1,we argue that keeping them separate is a bad idea for fintech decentralized autonomous organizations (daos)
2017-0050,2,"in fact, security and economics are one for daos: we show that the failure of a security property, e.g"
2017-0050,3,"anonymity, can destroy a daos because economic attacks can be tailgated to security attacks"
2017-0050,4,this is illustrated by the examples of thedao (built on the ethereum platform) and the daoed version of a futures exchange
2017-0050,5,"we claim that security and economics vulnerabilities, which we named seconomics vulnerabilities, are indeed new beasts to be reckoned with"

2016-0014,2,"deep convolutional neural network, one of the promising deep neural networks, can handle the local relationship between their nodes which can make this model powerful in the area of image and speech recognition"
2016-0014,3,"in this paper, we propose the deep convolutional neural network architecture that predicts whether a given customer is proper for bank telemarketing or not"
2016-0014,4,"the number of layers, learning rate, initial value of nodes, and other parameters that should be set to construct deep convolutional neural network are analyzed and proposed"
2016-0014,5,"to validate the proposed model, we use the bank marketing data of 45,211 phone calls collected during 30 months, and attain 76.70% of accuracy which outperforms other conventional classifiers"
2016-0011,0,we investigate the effects of entry of financial technology (fintech) based firms on competition in the retail payments market
2016-0011,1,"with a model of two-sided market with vertical restraints, we derive the following results"
2016-0011,2,"when only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants opt for multi-homing or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement"
2016-0011,3,"on the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is allowed, a partial multi-homing equilibrium could emerge under certain conditions, in which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur"
2016-0011,4,"without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant in general"
2016-0011,5,this suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market
2016-0002,0,"the rapid development of information and communications technology is transforming the entire industry landscape, heralding a new era of convergence services"
