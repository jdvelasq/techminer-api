Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and
reliance on REGTECH.

REGTECH developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the
reconceptualization of financial regulation.

REGTECH to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance
processes.

However, the potential of REGTECH is far greater  it has the potential to enable a nearly
real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while
facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance.

This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital

proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in
the financial sector and other industries.

Although also not a panacea, the development of "REGTECH" solutions will help clear away
volumes of work that understaffed and underfunded regulators cannot keep up with.

REGTECH will not eliminate policy considerations, nor will it render regulatory decisions
noncontroversial.

*** Baxter LG, 2016, DUKE LAW J, V66, P567
Nevertheless, a sophisticated deployment of REGTECH should help focus regulatory
discretion and public-policy debate on the elements of regulation where choices really
matter.

*** Buckley RP, 2020, J BANK REGUL, V21, P26
Europes road to REGTECH has rested upon four apparently unrelated pillars: (1) extensive
reporting requirements imposed after the global financial crisis to control systemic risk
and change in financial sector behaviour.

*** Buckley RP, 2020, J BANK REGUL, V21, P26
The paper analyses these four pillars and suggests that together they are underpinning the
development of a REGTECH ecosystem in europe and will continue to do so.

*** Buckley RP, 2020, J BANK REGUL, V21, P26
We argue that the european unions financial services and data protection regulatory
reforms have unintentionally driven the use of regulatory technologies (REGTECH) by
intermediaries, supervisors and regulators, and provided an environment within which
REGTECH can flourish.

Design/methodology/approach: in this paper, the authors propose a novel, regular
technology (REGTECH) cum automated legal text approach for financial transaction as well
as financial risk reporting that is based on cutting-edge distributed computing and
decentralised data management technologies such as distributed ledger (swanson, 2015),
distributed storage (arner et al., 2016. chandra et al., 2013. caron et al., 2014),
algorithmic financial contract standards (brammertz and mendelowitz, 2014. breymann and

linked to inadequate handling of risk data and to rein in compliance cost of supervisory
reporting.
