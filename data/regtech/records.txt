   ensemble LEARNING to ensure high CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY. third, we take
   into ACCOUNT_AUTHOR_CHARACTERISTICS to avoid discriminating classifications.

AB FRAMEWORK: IT is well known that the FINANCIAL_TECHNOLOGY (FINTECH) INDUSTRY
   has GREAT_POTENTIAL not only to transform the FINANCIAL_SYSTEM, but also to
   build an equitable and SUSTAINABLE_SOCIETY. in EFFECT, if this TECHNOLOGY is
   applied in the RIGHT_WAY, IT could be used to overcome the social and
   ECONOMIC_GAPS that exist WORLDWIDE. JUSTIFICATION: however, until now, the
   SPECIFIC_LEGAL_REGIMES (REGTECH) that have been established for FINTECH
   have, in ADDITION to the GENERAL_LACK of CONFIDENCE in NEW_TECHNOLOGIES,
   made its IMPLEMENTATION more difficult.  nevertheless, in ORDER to

   APPROPRIATE_REGTECH that ALLOWS for the PROGRESS of FINTECH, IT is necessary
   to analyse the LEGAL_PROBLEMS that restrict their EXPANSION by using an
   ANALYTICAL_METHODOLOGY and a BIBLIOGRAPHIC_COMPILATION of LEGAL_RESOLUTIONS.
   MAIN_CONCLUSION: LEGAL_PERSONAL_DATA_PROTECTION is the MAIN_OBSTACLE that
   must be overcome by paying ATTENTION to the GUARANTEES INHERENT to this
   FUNDAMENTAL_RIGHT. in this WAY, if the LEGAL_SYSTEM is to be READY for the

AB PURPOSE: the PAPERS_AIM is to consider how best to
   FORMULATE_STURDY_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORKS for REGTECH and SUPTECH. the
   PAPER_APPRAISES how KEY FEATURES of EU and UK_REGULATORY and
   POLICY_INITIATIVES can CONTRIBUTE to a FUNCTIONAL_FRAMEWORK for REGTECH and
   SUPTECH. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: the PAPER_REFERS to the most
   COMPREHENSIVE_EMPIRICAL_FINDINGS within the EU and the UK on REGTECH and
   SUPTECH, including REPORTS released by the european BANKING AUTHORITY and
   the BANK of ENGLAND. as DATA is only gradually becoming available about the
   TRUE_RATE of ADOPTION of REGTECH and SUPTECH, the
   PAPER_IDENTIFIES_SALIENT_AREAS that WARRANT_ANALYSIS from emerging FINDINGS.
   in LIGHT of the relatively restricted SOURCES of EMPIRICAL_DATA, the
   ARTICLES_METHODOLOGICAL_APPROACH is directed TOWARDS the most wide ranging
   and detailed SOURCES that are currently available at EU and UK_LEVELS.
   FINDINGS: the PAPER_REVEALS_DISTINCT_VARIATIONS in how the EU and UK have
   pursued REGULATORY_APPROACHES TOWARDS REGTECH and SUPTECH_GROWTH. however,
   there are many shared FEATURES in the RESPECTIVE_APPROACHES. the
   PAPER_ARGUES that a REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK should ideally be imbued with
   overarching STRATEGIES and POLICY_OBJECTIVES, as well as with
   PRACTICAL_MEASURES through INNOVATION_FACILITATORS, such as SANDBOXES. yet,
   legislative (top down) INTERVENTION will be the SIGNIFICANT_INGREDIENT in
   guaranteeing LEGAL_CLARITY for REGTECH and SUPTECH. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: by
   UNDERSTANDING the NUANCES in EU and UK_APPROACHES, the PAPER_ADVOCATES for
   PRAGMATIC_REASONING when formulating a REGULATORY_RESPONSE. the IMPORTANCE
   of the ARTICLE is in its FOCUS on the ELEMENTS of EU and
   UK_REGULATORY_APPROACHES that are most capable of guaranteeing CLARITY on
   STANDARDS RELATING to REGTECH and SUPTECH. the PAPER makes a
   VITAL_CONTRIBUTION to existing commentary by determining how a BALANCE can
   be struck between top down and bottom UP TYPES of REGULATION (I.e.  should
   REGULATION be entirely concerned with INDUSTRY DRIVEN STANDARDS, such as
   CODES of CONDUCT?).  2022, emerald PUBLISHING limited.

AB the VOLUME and COMPLEXITY of FINANCIAL_REGULATIONS have increased
   significantly since the 2008 FINANCIAL_CRISIS. this has put increasing
   PRESSURE on BANKS to monitor and REPORT a RANGE of INTRICATE_EXPOSURES to
   COMPLY with NEW_PRUDENTIAL_REQUIREMENTS. REGULATORY_TECHNOLOGY (REGTECH) is
   an emerging TECHNOLOGY_TREND LEVERAGING INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY and
   DIGITAL_INNOVATIONS that can greatly assist with a

   GLOBAL_OPERATIONS of FINANCE watched over by a
   REACTIVE_REGULATORY_FRAMEWORK, in a concerted EFFORT to enhance the
   RESILIENCE of INSTITUTIONAL_STRUCTURE, RECAPTURE_MARKET_TRUST and improve
   the critical SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE to the ECONOMY. many
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS are struggling with ever CHANGING
   REGULATORY_REQUIREMENTS and the increased BURDEN of INTRICATE_RULES.
   SUCH_RULES can be conflicting, and subjected to LOCAL_IMPLEMENTATION and
   JURISDICTIC_INTERPRETATION. non COMPLIANCE or the INABILITY to meet the
   DEADLINES_SUBJECT_INSTITUTIONS to HEFTY_PENALTIES and multimillion dollar
   FINES for FAILURES in CONTROLLING nefarious and over the counter TRADING
   ACTIVITIES. in this CHAPTER, we MAP out ongoing REGULATORY_MILESTONES
   globally to understand the MAIN_SUPERVISORY_PRIORITIES by TERRITORY and
   propose how FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS can successfully administer regulatory
   CHANGE through an AI DRIVEN regulatory MANAGEMENT MODEL within their
   ORGANIZATIONS. we discuss the EVOLUTION, CHALLENGES and RECOMMENDATIONS for
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS (including SHARIAH_COMPLIANCE) in the
   CHANGE_MANAGEMENT for REGULATIONS using a structured APPROACH that ADDRESSES

   changed massively after the FINANCIAL_CRISIS of 2008. NEW_REGULATIONS and
   ENFORCEMENTS are being imposed on BANKS causing the COMPLIANCE_COST to
   INCREASE dramatically.  REGTECH has been invented by TECHNOLOGY_FIRMS acting
   as a POTENTIAL_SOLUTION to BANKS. the STUDY will DEMONSTRATE the ABILITY of
   REGTECH to reduce the COMPLIANCE_COST, STRENGTHEN MONEY_LAUNDERING
   PREVENTION and reduce the REPUTATIONAL_RISK in BANKING_SECTORS. this
   STUDY_TARGET_SAMPLE was BANKS_EMPLOYEES in BAHRAIN because of their
   PROPER_KNOWLEDGE about ANTI_MONEY_LAUNDERING. DATA were collected from 100
   RESPONDENTS from the BANKING_SECTOR of BAHRAIN. DESCRIPTIVE_ANALYSIS was
   used to analyze the DATA while REGRESSION_MODEL and SPEARMANS_CORRELATION
   were used to TEST the HYPOTHESIS. the RESULTS of this ANALYSIS indicate that
   REGTECH has POSITIVE_IMPACT on STRENGTHENING and enhancing MONEY_LAUNDERING
   PREVENTION in BANKS. the FINDINGS of the STUDY will HELP BANKS understand
   the EFFECTIVENESS of REGTECH_SOLUTIONS, raise BANKERS_AWARENESS about the

   like to examine the EXPERIENCES of TECHNOLOGY_INTEGRATION applied to the
   REGULATION of the MARKETS and to the COMPLIACE, in the BANKING_SECTOR in

   REGTECH is mainly based on legal, DEFINING ARGUMENTS and about reviewing the
   LITERATURE on the MACRO_CONTEXT and the ISSUES generated by the HUGE_AMOUNT
   of REGULATION. the ARTICLE will explore three CASES of REGTECH_COMPANIES in
   ITALY PRESENTING ADVANTAGES and CRITICALITIES in the ADOPTION of
   REGTECH_SOLUTIONS on the ITALIAN_MARKET. METHODS/APPROACH: TODAY the
   LITERATURE about CASE_STUDY in REGTECH is not proposing any SOLUTION of
   COOPERATION on the REGULATORY_FIELD in ITALY. so we have to fill the GAP we
   find in EXPLORATION of LITERATURE. an ANALYSIS in the FIELD cannot be
   separated from a PRELIMINARY_SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW of the LITERATURE on
   REGULATORY_CASE_STUDIES. we begin our SCIENTIFIC_ANALYSIS of the SUBJECT
   through a PRELIMINARY_LITERATURE_REVIEW individuating any CASE_STUDY around
   REGTECH through EXPLORATORY_CASE_STUDY. due to the SCARCITY of PAPERS about
   CASE_STUDY in REGTECH_FIELD, we adopt an APPROACH already used for well
   studied CASES widespread in the FINTECH_AREA and an
   EXPLORATORY_INVESTIGATION through in DEEP_INTERVIEWS following MODELS used
   in FINTECH_AREA and in ERM_FIELD. RESULTS/FINDINGS: in this ARTICLE, we
   will, THEREFORE, propose CASE_STUDIES in the FINTECH_SECTOR applied to
   REGULATORY_TECHNOLOGY in ITALY and we expect to answer the following
   RESEARCH_QUESTIONS: we PRESENT three REGTECH'S CASES in ITALY'S
   FINANCIAL_SYSTEM exposing the FIELDS of COLLABORATION with
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS in REGTECH_FIELD between INCUMBENTS and
   REGTECH_INDUSTRIES. we expose also how big I.t.  COMPANIES, which are
   providing SERVICES for BANKS, are refocusing and improving COMPLIANCE
   through REGTECH to provide SERVICES linked to COMPLIANCE, KYC, AML, PRIVACY,
   PAYMENTS to the INCUMBENTS. in CONCLUSION we EXPRESS_TOPICS interested by
   COOPERATION between BANKS and REGTECH_COMPANIES describing the
   POTETIAL_EXPANSION_LINES. IMPLICATIONS: understand how FINANCIAL_COMPANIES
   through REGULATORY_TECHNOLOGY can: improve RISK_MANAGEMENT and GOVERNANCE in
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS. improve PRUDENTIAL_COMPLIANCE, ANTI_MONEY_LAUNDERING
   and CUSTOMER_PROTECTION. reduce the RISKS of traditional BANKING BUSINESS

AB PURPOSE: ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE has had a MAJOR_IMPACT on ORGANISATIONS
   from BANKING through to LAW_FIRMS. the RATE at which TECHNOLOGY has
   developed in TERMS of TASKS that are complex, technical and TIME consuming
   has been astounding.  the PURPOSE of this PAPER is to explore the SOLUTIONS
   that AI, REGTECH and CHARITYTECH provide to CHARITIES in navigating the
   VAST_AMOUNT of ANTI_MONEY_LAUNDERING and COUNTER_TERROR_FINANCE LEGISLATION
   in the UK; so that they COMPLY with the REQUIREMENTS and mitigate the
   POTENTIAL_RISK they FACE but also develop a more COHERENT and streamlined
   SET of ACTIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: the SUBJECT is approached
   through the ANALYSIS of DATA, LITERATURE and, domestic and
   INTERNATIONAL_REGULATION. the first PART of the PAPER_EXPLORES the
   CURRENT_OBLIGATIONS and RISKS_CHARITIES FACE, these are then, in the second
   PART, SET against the EXAMINATION of POTENTIAL_TECHNOLOGICAL_SOLUTIONS as of
   august 2020. FINDINGS: IT is suggested that CHARITIES underestimate the
   IMPORTANCE of the NATURE and SIZE of the THREAT posed to them, this is
   significant, as demonstrated, given the GROWING SIZE and IMPACT of the
   SECTOR. TECHNOLOGICAL_SOLUTIONS are suggested to combat the ISSUES_CHARITIES
   FACE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: the STUDY is original because IT is the first to
   CREATE the NOTION of CHARITYTECH and to specifically explore what
   TECHNOLOGICAL_ADVANCES can assist CHARITIES in meeting the
   REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE_CHALLENGE.  2020, emerald PUBLISHING limited.

AB the ACCOUNTABILITY_PRINCIPLE of the GDPR requires that an ORGANISATION can
   DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE with the REGULATIONS. a SURVEY of
   GDPR_COMPLIANCE_SOFTWARE_SOLUTIONS_SHOWS SIGNIFICANT_GAPS in their ABILITY
   to DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE. in CONTRAST, REGTECH has recently BROUGHT
   GREAT_SUCCESS to FINANCIAL_COMPLIANCE, resulting in reduced RISK,
   COST_SAVING and enhanced FINANCIAL_REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE. IT is shown that
   many GDPR_SOLUTIONS_LACK_INTEROPERABILITY FEATURES such as STANDARD_APIS,
   meta DATA or REPORTS and they are not supported by published METHODOLOGIES
   or EVIDENCE to SUPPORT their VALIDITY or even UTILITY. a PROOF_OF_CONCEPT
   PROTOTYPE was explored using a REGULATOR based SELF_ASSESSMENT checklist to
   establish if REGTECH best PRACTICE could improve the DEMONSTRATION of
   GDPR_COMPLIANCE. the APPLICATION of a REGTECH_APPROACH provides
   OPPORTUNITIES for demonstrable and validated GDPR_COMPLIANCE,
   notwithstanding the RISK_REDUCTIONS and COST_SAVINGS that REGTECH can
   deliver.  this PAPER demonstrates a REGTECH_APPROACH to GDPR_COMPLIANCE can

AB PURPOSE: this STUDY_AIMS to discuss the GROWING USE of REGTECH_SOLUTIONS by
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS to COMPLY more efficiently with REGULATION in TERMS
   of ANTI_MONEY_LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE and more specifically its INFLUENCE on
   the EVOLUTION of FINANCIAL_CRIME in the next TEN YEARS.
   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: based on two ONLINE_DELPHI_SURVEYS sent to a
   PANEL of INTERNATIONAL_EXPERTS composed of eight specially recruited
   PROFESSIONALS and SPECIALISTS of anti FINANCIAL_CRIME COMPLIANCE and
   REGTECH, five MAIN_PREDICTIONS have been developed.  FINDINGS: IT was found
   that ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE would BECOME the most IMPACTFUL_TECHNOLOGY for
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS to FIGHT FINANCIAL_CRIME, and that there will be a
   STRONG_POSITIVE_CORRELATION between ever more elaborated COMPLIANCE_PROGRAMS
   and the LEVEL of SOPHISTICATION of METHODS used for MONEY_LAUNDERING.
   furthermore, the PANEL designated REGULATORS_RECOMMENDATIONS as likely to be
   less influential than REGTECH_SOLUTIONS, and the TIME required to integrate
   REGTECH_SOLUTIONS for AML_COMPLIANCE as the MAIN_FUTURE_CHALLENGE.
   ORIGINALITY/VALUE: these PREDICTIONS are meant to provide
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS and REGULATORS with USEFUL_OUTLOOKS. while the
   reviewed LITERATURE focused on the ROLE of REGULATIONS on the EVOLUTION of
   MONEY_LAUNDERING, this STUDY puts STRESS on REGTECH_SOLUTIONS and their

   we further AIM to OFFER VARIOUS_PERSPECTIVES in ORDER to aid the
   UNDERSTANDING of the DISRUPTIVE_POTENTIAL of FINTECH, and its IMPLICATIONS
   for the WIDER FINANCIAL_ECOSYSTEM. by drawing upon very recent and highly
   TOPICAL_RESEARCH on this AREA this STUDY_EXAMINES the IMPLICATIONS for

   CHALLENGE to the global BANKING and REGULATORY_SYSTEM. IT is DRIVEN by a
   wide ranging OVERVIEW of the DEVELOPMENT, the CURRENT_STATE, and
   POSSIBLE_FUTURE of FINTECH. this PAPER_ATTEMPTS to connect practitioner led
   and ACADEMIC_RESEARCH. while IT draws on ACADEMIC_RESEARCH, the PERSPECTIVE
   IT takes is also PRACTICE oriented.  IT relies on the
   CURRENT_ACADEMIC_LITERATURE as well as INSIGHTS from INDUSTRY_SOURCES,
   ACTION_RESEARCH and other publicly AVAILABLE_COMMENTARIES. IT also draws on
   PROFESSIONAL_PRACTITIONERS ROUNDTABLE_DISCUSSIONS, and THINK tanks in which
   the AUTHOR has been an ACTIVE_PARTICIPANT. we ATTEMPT to interpret BANKING,
   and REGULATORY_ISSUES from a BEHAVIOURAL_PERSPECTIVE. the last CRISIS
   exposed SIGNIFICANT_FAILURES in REGULATION and SUPERVISION. IT has made the
   FINANCIAL_MARKET_LAW and COMPLIANCE a KEY_TOPIC on the CURRENT_AGENDA.
   DISRUPTIVE_TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE also seems to be important in investigating
   REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE followed by CHANGE. we CONTRIBUTE to the
   CURRENT_LITERATURE_REVIEW on financial and DIGITAL_INNOVATION by
   NEW_ENTRANTS where this has also PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS. we also provide for
   an updated REVIEW of the CURRENT_REGULATORY_ISSUES addressing the
   CONTEXTUAL_ROOT_CAUSES of DISRUPTION within the FINANCIAL_SERVICES_DOMAIN.
   the AIM here is to assist MARKET_PARTICIPANTS to improve EFFECTIVENESS and
   COLLABORATION. the DIFFICULTIES ARISING from EXTENSIVE_REGULATION may
   suggest a more liberal and principled APPROACH to FINANCIAL_REGULATION.
   DISRUPTIVE_INNOVATION has the POTENTIAL for WELFARE_OUTCOMES for CONSUMERS,
   regulatory, and SUPERVISORY_GAINS as well as REPUTATIONAL_GAINS for the
   FINANCIAL_SERVICES_INDUSTRY. IT BECOMES even more important as the
   FINANCIAL_SERVICES_INDUSTRY_EVOLVES. for EXAMPLE, the PREPAREDNESS of the
   REGULATORS to INSTIL_CULTURE CHANGE and HARMONISE_TECHNOLOGICAL_ADVANCEMENTS
   with REGULATION could likely achieve many desired OUTCOMES.
   SUCH_RESULTS_RANGE from achieving an ORDERLY_MARKET_GROWTH, further aiding
   SYSTEMIC_STABILITY and restoring TRUST and CONFIDENCE in the
   FINANCIAL_SYSTEM. our ACTION led RESEARCH_RESULTS have IMPLICATIONS for BOTH
   RESEARCH and PRACTICE. these should be of INTEREST to regulatory
   STANDARD_SETTERS, INVESTORS, INTERNATIONAL_ORGANISATIONS and other ACADEMICS
   who are researching regulatory and COMPETITION_ISSUES, and their
   MANIFESTATION within the financial and SOCIAL_CONTEXTS. as a PERSPECTIVE on
   a SOCIAL_CONSTRUCT, this STUDY_APPEALS to REGULATORS and LAW_MAKERS,
   ENTREPRENEURS, and INVESTORS who participate in TECHNOLOGY applied within

TI an INNOVATIVE_REGTECH_APPROACH to FINANCIAL_RISK MONITORING and supervisory

AB PURPOSE: the PURPOSE of this STUDY is to propose a BEARER_SERVICE, which
   generates and maintains a DIGITAL_DOPPELGANGER for every FINANCIAL_CONTRACT
   in the FORM of a DYNAMIC_TRANSACTION_DOCUMENT that is a standardised
   DATA_FACILITY automatically MAKING IMPORTANT_CONTRACT_DATA from the
   TRANSACTION_COUNTERPARTIES available to RELEVANT_AUTHORITIES mandated by LAW
   to request and PROCESS SUCH_DATA. this would be achieved by SHARING
   CERTAIN_ELEMENTS of the DYNAMIC_TRANSACTION_DOCUMENT on a BEARER_SERVICE,
   based on a FEDERATION of DISTRIBUTION_LEDGERS; such a quasi simultaneous
   SHARING of RISK_DATA BECOMES possible because the
   DYNAMIC_TRANSACTION_DOCUMENT maintain a RECORD of STATE in semi real TIME,
   and this STATE can be verified by ANYBODY with ACCESS to the
   DISTRIBUTION_LEDGERS, also in semi real TIME. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH:
   in this PAPER, the AUTHORS propose a NOVEL, REGULAR_TECHNOLOGY (REGTECH) CUM
   automated LEGAL_TEXT_APPROACH for FINANCIAL_TRANSACTION as well as
   FINANCIAL_RISK REPORTING that is based on cutting EDGE distributed COMPUTING
   and decentralised DATA_MANAGEMENT_TECHNOLOGIES such as DISTRIBUTED_LEDGER
   (SWANSON, 2015), distributed STORAGE (ARNER ET AL., 2016; chandra ET AL.,
   2013; CARON ET AL., 2014), algorithmic FINANCIAL_CONTRACT_STANDARDS
   (BRAMMERTZ and MENDELOWITZ, 2014; BREYMANN and MENDELOWITZ, 2015; BRASWELL,
   2016), automated LEGAL_TEXT (HAZARD and HAAPIO, 2017) and
   DOCUMENT_ENGINEERING_METHODS and TECHNIQUES (GLUSHKO and MCGRATH, 2005).
   this APPROACH is equally inspired by the CONCEPT of the BEARER_SERVICE and
   its CAPACITY to span over existing and FUTURE_TECHNOLOGICAL_SYSTEMS and
   SUBSTRATES (kavassalis ET AL., 2000; CLARK, 1988). FINDINGS: the RESULT is a
   TRANSFORMATION of SUPERVISORS_CAPACITY to MONITOR_RISK in the
   FINANCIAL_SYSTEM based on DATA which preserve INFORMATIONAL_CONTENT of
   FINANCIAL_INSTRUMENTS at the most GRANULAR_LEVEL, in COMBINATION with a
   mathematically ROBUST_TIME stamping APPROACH using BLOCKCHAIN_TECHNOLOGY.
   PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS: the REGTECH_APPROACH has the POTENTIAL to contain
   OPERATIONAL_RISK linked to inadequate HANDLING of RISK_DATA and to rein in
   COMPLIANCE_COST of supervisory REPORTING. ORIGINALITY_VALUE: the
   PRESENT_REGTECH_APPROACH to FINANCIAL_RISK MONITORING and supervisory
   REPORTING is the first INTEGRATION of algorithmic FINANCIAL_DATA_STANDARDS
   with BLOCKCHAIN_FUNCTIONALITY.  2018, emerald PUBLISHING limited.

AB REGULATORY_TECHNOLOGY or 'REGTECH' is the USE of TECHNOLOGY, particularly

   REPORTING and COMPLIANCE_PROCESSES, for EXAMPLE in the CONTEXT of know your

   FINANCIAL_SERVICES_INDUSTRY and REGULATORS. however, the POTENTIAL of
   REGTECH is far greater   IT could enable close to REAL_TIME_MONITORING and a
   PROPORTIONATE_REGULATORY_REGIME that ADDRESSES_RISK and facilitates more
   EFFICIENT_REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE. we argue that the TRANSFORMATIVE_NATURE of
   TECHNOLOGY will only be captured by a NEW_APPROACH that sits at the NEXUS
   between DATA, DIGITAL_IDENTITY, and REGULATION. we SEEK to expose the
   INADEQUACY and LACK of AMBITION of simply digitizing ANALOGUE_PROCESSES in a
   DIGITAL FINANCIAL_WORLD. the DEVELOPMENT of FINANCIAL_TECHNOLOGY
   ('FINTECH'), RAPID_DEVELOPMENTS in EMERGING_MARKETS, and the recent pro

AB regulatory CHANGE and TECHNOLOGICAL_DEVELOPMENTS following the 2008
   GLOBAL_FINANCIAL_CRISIS are CHANGING the NATURE of FINANCIAL_MARKETS,

   REGULATORY_TECHNOLOGY or REGTECHTHE_USE of TECHNOLOGY, particularly
   INFORMATION_TECHNOLOGY, in the CONTEXT of REGULATORY_MONITORING, REPORTING,
   and COMPLIANCE. REGULATING rapidly transforming FINANCIAL_SYSTEMS requires
   increasing the USE of and RELIANCE on REGTECH. WHILST the
   PRINCIPAL_REGULATORY_OBJECTIVES (e.g., FINANCIAL_STABILITY,
   PRUDENTIAL_SAFETY and SOUNDNESS, CONSUMER_PROTECTION and MARKET_INTEGRITY,
   and MARKET_COMPETITION and DEVELOPMENT) REMAIN, their MEANS of APPLICATION
   are increasingly inadequate.  REGTECH_DEVELOPMENTS are leading TOWARDS a

AB frustrated by the seeming INABILITY of REGULATORS and PROSECUTORS to hold
   BANK_EXECUTIVES to ACCOUNT for LOSSES inflicted by their COMPANIES BEFORE,
   during, and since the FINANCIAL_CRISIS of 2008, some SCHOLARS have suggested
   that private attorney general SUITS such as CLASS_ACTION and
   SHAREHOLDER_DERIVATIVE_SUITS might achieve better RESULTS. while a few
   isolated SUITS might be successful in CASES where there is PROVABLE_FRAUD,
   SUCH_REMEDIES are no GENERAL_PANACEA for preventing large SCALE BANK
   inflicted LOSSES. LARGE_LOSSES are nearly always the RESULT of unforeseeable
   or suddenly CHANGING ECONOMIC_CONDITIONS, POOR_BUSINESS_JUDGMENT, or
   INADEQUATE_REGULATORY SUPERVISION usually a COMBINATION of all three.  yet
   REGULATORS FACE an increasingly COMPLEX_TASK in supervising
   MODERN_FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS. this ARTICLE EXPLAINS how the CHALLENGE has
   BECOME so difficult.  IT argues for preserving REGULATORY_DISCRETION rather
   than reducing IT through FORMAL_CONGRESSIONAL_DIRECTION. the ARTICLE also
   asserts that REGULATORS have to develop their OWN_SOPHISTICATED_METHODS of
   automated SUPERVISION. although also not a PANACEA, the DEVELOPMENT of
   "REGTECH" SOLUTIONS will HELP clear away VOLUMES of WORK that understaffed
   and underfunded REGULATORS cannot keep UP with.  REGTECH will not eliminate
   POLICY_CONSIDERATIONS, nor will IT render
   REGULATORY_DECISIONS_NONCONTROVERSIAL. nevertheless, a
   SOPHISTICATED_DEPLOYMENT of REGTECH should HELP FOCUS_REGULATORY_DISCRETION
   and PUBLIC_POLICY DEBATE on the ELEMENTS of REGULATION where CHOICES really
   MATTER.  2016 lawrence g.  baxter.
