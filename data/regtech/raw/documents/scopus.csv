New regulatory technologies (RegTech) are helping to transform how compliance issues are handled. This study aims to highlight the benefits of RegTech solutions for companies as well as the challenges of adopting these technologies. It also addresses the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) II legislation, which has led to an increase in the number of RegTech companies. Although these systems of technology offer compelling compliance tools, they also pose significant risks. For this reason, this study aims to draw attention to the opportunities and potential pitfalls associated with RegTech and propose recommendations for addressing the challenges related to implementing RegTech solutions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Benefits; Challenges; Companies; Compliance; MiFID II; RegTech","Benefit; Benefit and challenges; Challenge; Compliance; Global financial crisis; Market in financial instrument directive II; Potential benefits; Regulatory technology; Technology companies; Technology solutions; Regulatory compliance; business development; financial crisis; global economy; information and communication technology; information technology; regulatory framework; technology adoption; technology diffusion","Yeung, K., Algorithmic regulation: a critical interrogation (2018) Regulation & Governance, 12 (4), pp. 505-523; Hildebrandt, M., Algorithmic regulation and the rule of law (2018) Phil.

Our mechanism analysis suggests that the improved firm performance is mainly driven by the enhanced governance role played by informed investors and institutional investors. Further analysis shows that online shareholder voting makes the firms more attractive to mutual fund managers who are far away from the firms. Moreover, we find that the improved firm performance is concentrated in firms with low controlling shareholder ownership, and that online shareholder voting is associated with an increased likelihood of vetoing proposals and lower tunneling. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Annual General Meetings; Costs of Voting; Online Shareholder Voting; RegTech; Shareholder Monitoring",,"Aggarwal, R., Erel, I., Ferreira, M., Matos, P., Does governance travel around the world?

Using a two-stage least squares instrumental variable regression approach and correcting for cross-sectional dependency, simultaneity, and endogeneity of regressors, the results establish a positive link between fintech and financial development. Our findings show that fintech supports financial sector development by enhancing access (loans), depth (deposits), and savings within China’s financial institutions. We also show that the emergence of fintech in the area of financial regulation (regulatory technology: regtech) can significantly improve financial development outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative for regulators to pursue policies that balance growth in the fintech sector while mitigating the associated risks. In addition, we use the difference-in-differences approach to show that policy measures such as interest rates liberalization also positively impacted financial development during the analysis period. In our conclusion, we suggest a policy framework for balanced fintech sector growth in developing countries. © 2022, The Author(s).","China; Financial development; Fintech; Regtech",,"(2018) Mind the gap: The challenges to fintech adaption, , FinTech Innovation Lab.

This paper documents the real effects of RegTech in the market of corporate control. Exploiting the staggered implementation of the EDGAR system from 1993 to 1996 as quasi-exogenous RegTech shocks, we find that RegTech developments reduce firm acquisitiveness, especially for growth firms, solo-bidder deals, and stock-based acquisitions. Our main findings still hold when employing the stack-cohort approach to address concerns regarding biased staggered DiD estimators. In addition, EDGAR implementation discourages informed trading and lowers the acquirers' announcement returns. Overall, our deal-level analyses show how RegTech development matters for firm investment decisions with more granularities. Our paper differs from but complements recent empirical evidence that EDGAR implementation increases the level of overall investment, suggesting that dampened managerial learning induces firms to switch from highly risky and uncertain projects (M&As) to routine projects with less uncertainty (capital expenditures). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","EDGAR; Firm acquisitiveness; Mergers and acquisitions (M&As); Price efficiency; Regulation technology (RegTech)",,"Almeida, H., Campello, M., Hackbarth, D., Liquidity mergers (2011) J.

This work builds on a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis of the literature on RegTech, its influential papers and authors, its main areas of research, its past and its future. The resulting multi-dimensional framework bridges across four main dimensions, starting with regulation and technology, where one or more regulations, not necessarily financial ones, are addressed with the support of technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, DLT, blockchain, smart contracts, API). Data play a central role, as sharing them enables data ecosystems, where additional value can be attained by each market participant, while data automation and machine-readable regulations empower regulators to pull data directly from the banks’ systems and combine these data with data obtained directly from customers or other external sources. Several applications emerge, both for regulated entities, covering matters of compliance, monitoring, risk management, reporting and operations, as well as for authorities, which can leverage on RegTech (SupTech) solutions to make policies, to undertake their authorising, supervising and enforcement operations, for monitoring and controlling purposes, and even to issue fines automatically. As a consequence, stakeholders can reap a series of benefits, such as higher efficiency and effectiveness, accuracy, transparency and lower compliance costs but also risks, such as cyber risk, algorithmic biases, and dehumanization. © 2022, The Author(s).","Compliance; Data; Digital innovation; FinTech; Insurtech; Monitoring; RegTech; Regulation; Regulatory technology; Reporting; Risk management; SupTech",,"Acedo, F.J., Barroso, C., Casanueva, C., Galan, J.L., Co-authorship in management and organizational studies: An Empirical and Network Analysis (2006) Journal of Management Studies, 43 (5), pp. 957-983; Admati, A., Hellwig, M., (2014) The bankers’ New Clothes, , Princeton University Press; Aksoy, M., Yilmaz, M.K., Topcu, N., Uysal, Ö., The impact of ownership structure, board attributes and XBRL mandate on timeliness of financial reporting: evidence from Turkey (2021) Journal of Applied Accounting Research; Alam, M.Z., Nasir, N., Rehman, C.A., Intrapreneurship concepts for engineers: A systematic review of the literature on its theoretical foundations and agenda for future research (2020) Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 9, pp. 1-21; Alrabiah, A., Optimal regulation of banking system’s advanced credit risk management by unified computational representation of business processes across the entire banking system (2018) Cogent Economics & Finance, 6 (1), p. 1486685; Anagnostopoulos, I., Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks (2018) Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25; Apostolou, A.K., Nanopoulos, K.A., Interactive financial reporting using XBRL: An overview of the global markets and Europe (2009) International Journal of Disclosure and Governance, 6 (3), pp. 262-272; Appio, F.P., Cesaroni, F., Di Minin, A., Visualizing the structure and bridges of the intellectual property management and strategy literature: A document cocitation analysis (2014) Scientometrics, 101 (1), pp. 623-661; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., RegTech: Building a Better Financial System1.

Nevertheless, previous research neglects that the output of RegTech applications has to be explainable and non-discriminatory. Within this study, we propose design principles and features for a RegTech approach which provides automated assessments of financial consumer complaints. We follow three main design principles. First, we build upon information diagnosticity theory to address the need for explainable classifications empowering regulators to justify their actions. Second, we consider a bag-of-words representation and ensemble learning to ensure high classification accuracy. Third, we take into account author characteristics to avoid discriminating classifications. We evaluate our approach in the financial services industry and show its value for identifying consumer complaints resulting in monetary compensations. The proposed design principles and features are highly relevant for regulators, corporations as well as consumers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer complaints; Explainable AI; Fair AI; Predictive analytics; Regulatory enforcement; Regulatory technology (RegTech)","Classification (of information); Automated monitoring; Consumer complaints; Data-source; Design features; Design Principles; Explainable AI; Fair AI; Regulatory enforcement; Regulatory technology; Technology application; Predictive analytics","Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckey, R.P., FinTech, RegTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2016) Nw.

In effect, if this technology is applied in the right way, it could be used to overcome the social and economic gaps that exist worldwide. Justification: However, until now, the specific legal regimes (RegTech) that have been established for Fintech have, in addition to the general lack of confidence in new technologies, made its implementation more difficult. Nevertheless, in order to consolidate Fintech, it is necessary to design suitable regulation to transform these new technologies into ordinary instruments of our financial system. Objective: Therefore, in order to promote an appropriate RegTech that allows for the progress of Fintech, it is necessary to analyse the legal problems that restrict their expansion by using an analytical methodology and a bibliographic compilation of legal resolutions. Main conclusion: Legal personal data protection is the main obstacle that must be overcome by paying attention to the guarantees inherent to this fundamental right. In this way, if the legal system is to be ready for the Digital Revolution, society must not be worried about either the loss of rights or increases in inequalities. ©","algorithmic transparency; big data; data protection; Fintech sustainability; RegTech",,"Consens, B., Gunderson, L., Allen, C., Benson, M.H., (2014) Identifying Legal, Ecological and Governance Obstacles, and Opportunities for Adapting to Climate Change, 6. , Sustainability 2339; Butler, T., Towards a Standards-Based Technology Architecture for RegTech (2017) Journal of Financial Transformation, 45, p. 49; Rodríguez Ballano, S., Habemus Nuevo Reglamento General de Proteccíon de Datos"" (2016) 919 Actualidad Jurídica Aranzadi, 9; Falcone, P.M., Morone, P., Sica, E., (2018) Greening of the Financial System and Fuelling A Sustainability Transition, , A Discursive Approach to Assess Landscape Pressures on the Italian Financial System","Cruz Rambaud, S.; Department of Economics and Business, La Cañada de San Urbano, Spain; email: scruz@ual.es",1867299X,,,"Eur.

The speed with which this technology is developing to undertake tasks that are not only complex and technical but also time-consuming and that are subject to constantly changing parameters is astounding. The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which machine learning can be used as a solution to lighten the compliance and regulatory burden on charitable organisations in the UK; so that they can comply with their regulatory duties and develop a coherent and streamlined action plan in relation to technological investment. Design/methodology/approach: The subject is approached through the analysis of data, literature and domestic and international regulation. The first part of the study summarises the extent of current regulatory obligations faced by charities, these are then, in the second part, set against the potential technological solutions provided by machine learning as of July 2021. Findings: It is suggested that charities can use machine learning as a smart technological solution to ease the regulatory burden they face in a growing and impactful sector. Originality/value: The work is original because it is the first to specifically explore how machine learning as a technological advance can assist charities in meeting the regulatory compliance challenge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CharityTech; English law; Machine learning; RegTech; Unsupervised learning",,"Aberdeen, A., Pacovsky, O., Slater, A., (2019) The Learning behind Gmail Priority Inbox, , Google, Zurich; (2020), Mitigating Human BiasAI; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The emergence of RegTech 2.0: from know your customer to know your data (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, 79. , UNSW Law Research Paper 17–63; Barr, W., Shell charities and terrorist financing: a sledgehammer to crack a shell?

RegTech helps them to streamline compliance processes. Although dominant in the financial sector, ideally, RegTech can be implemented in various sectors other than finance. The critical elements of RegTech are regulated entities, supervisors and/or regulators, regulatory data, and data generated by regulated entities' activities. The technology at RegTech will bring all these elements together to achieve regulatory compliance. This study describes RegTech regarding technology utilization, characteristics, and architecture in the financial industry. The results of this study can be adopted as a basis for answering the challenges of implementing RegTech in various sectors of activity. Therefore, we used the systematic literature review approach to review several prior studies. Based on the search results, thirty-seven articles were chosen successfully for further review. RegTech focussed on four characteristics: Agility, speed, integration, and analytics. Various technologies are used in RegTech, such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud computing, blockchain, etc. Generally, RegTech architecture components can be grouped into enterprise architecture (EA) layers: business, data, application, and technology. © 2022 IEEE.","architectures; characteristics; regtech; systematic literature review; technologies","Artificial intelligence; Cloud analytics; Computer architecture; Data Analytics; Engineering education; Regulatory compliance; Characteristic; Digital innovations; Financial sectors; Financial services industries; Information technology innovation; Regtech; Systematic literature review; Technology; Technology architectures; Technology characteristics; Finance","Arner, D.W., Dan Barberis, R.P., Buckley, J., Financial regulation (2011) Natl.

Financial institutions needed to interpret new regulations and swiftly adjusted to them. RegTech, Regulatory Technology, was born to ease the regulatory requirements compliance process. RegTech was then also adopted by supervisor and/or regulator to supervise the compliance of financial institutions. The adoption of RegTech by supervisor is called SupTech (Supervisory Technology). RegTech and SupTech were discussed mostly in banking or financial research. This paper tries to bring more nuance to information technology e.g., the capabilities and their underpinning technology. Hence, RegTech/SupTech can be more discussed in computer science research. This paper also concludes the definition of RegTech/Suptech and states one core capability of RegTech with its four pillars. © 2022 IEEE.","RegTech; Smart Regulatory Compliance; SupTech","Finance; Supervisory personnel; Computer science research; Core capabilities; Financial institution; Financial regulations; Global financial crisis; Regtech; Regulatory requirements; Smart regulatory compliance; Supervisory technology; Regulatory compliance","Von Solms, J., Integrating Regulatory Technology (RegTech) into the digital transformation of a bank Treasury J.

This paper contextualises and interrogates the novelty of the RegTech phenomenon as expounded in recent years by industry practitioners, regulators and a growing chorus of scholars. Harnessing the notion of ‘imaginary’ from Science and Technology Studies, we identify a particular solutionist vision materialising across public documents from national and international financial regulators, industry organisations, as well as RegTech and consulting firms. We identify two failures of an emerging RegTech imaginary. First, is a dynamism failure in the way RegTech materialises static visions of regulation. Second, is a systems failure as the solutionist RegTech imaginary focuses on narrower, individual problems in finance at the expense of wider changes occurring since the 2007–8 global financial crisis. RegTech, we conclude, reflects continuities with a pre-crisis era and fails to tackle key market and regulatory changes occurring since. Our analysis holds implications for the turn to technological solutions in addressing persistent issues of instability in global financial governance. We point to the need for developing wider imaginaries of technological possibilities for regulation in an increasingly digital world. © 2022 The Author(s).

The paper appraises how key features of EU and UK regulatory and policy initiatives can contribute to a functional framework for RegTech and SupTech. Design/methodology/approach: The paper refers to the most comprehensive empirical findings within the EU and the UK on RegTech and SupTech, including reports released by the European Banking Authority and the Bank of England. As data is only gradually becoming available about the true rate of adoption of RegTech and SupTech, the paper identifies salient areas that warrant analysis from emerging findings. In light of the relatively restricted sources of empirical data, the article’s methodological approach is directed towards the most wide-ranging and detailed sources that are currently available at EU and UK levels. Findings: The paper reveals distinct variations in how the EU and UK have pursued regulatory approaches towards RegTech and SupTech growth. However, there are many shared features in the respective approaches. The paper argues that a regulatory framework should ideally be imbued with overarching strategies and policy objectives, as well as with practical measures through innovation facilitators, such as sandboxes. Yet, legislative (top-down) intervention will be the significant ingredient in guaranteeing legal clarity for RegTech and SupTech. Originality/value: By understanding the nuances in EU and UK approaches, the paper advocates for pragmatic reasoning when formulating a regulatory response. The importance of the article is in its focus on the elements of EU and UK regulatory approaches that are most capable of guaranteeing clarity on standards relating to RegTech and SupTech. The paper makes a vital contribution to existing commentary by determining how a balance can be struck between “top-down” and “bottom-up” types of regulation (i.e. should regulation be entirely concerned with industry-driven standards, such as codes of conduct?). © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking regulation; Finance; Financial law; Financial regulation; Financial services; Reporting",,"Arner, D., Barberis, J., Buckley, R., FinTech, RegTech and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37 (3), p. 371; Bamberger, K., Technologies of compliance: risk and regulation in a digital age (2010) Texas Law Review, 88 (4), p. 669; (2019) Future of Finance, Review on the Outlook for the UK Financial Sector: What It Means for the Bank of England; (2019) New economy, new finance, new bank.

It is also one of the most researched topics during the current period. Banks and financial institutions nowadays are collecting large amounts of customer information which are imposed with AI and machine learning; however, the succeeding of all information remains unknown. This study attempts to identify the ethical issues in the application of Artificial intelligence and offers remedies from the Shariah principles. It also examines the role of Regulation technology (RegTech) in Islamic financial institutions. This study is exploratory in nature and used mainly primary data for the analysis purpose. The primary data is collected through the structured questionnaire obtained from the sharia scholars living in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The findings of the study suggest that the there is a significant relationship between ethical issues in AI implementation, role of RegTech and Islamic finance. The findings also suggest that the effective and intelligent utilization of RegTech and Islamic finance tools can reduce the ethical concern related to the AI implementation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Ethical issues; Ethics; Islamic finance",,"Qadir, J., Suleman, M., Teaching ethics, (Islamic) values and technology: Musings on course design and experience (2018) 2018 7Th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE), pp. 486-491. , pp., IEEE, September; Rabbani, M.R., The competitive structure and strategic positioning of commercial banks in Saudi Arabia (2020) Int.

In this context, financial services firms started to improve their vigilance and use new technologies and approaches to identify and predict financial fraud and crime possibilities. This task is challenging as institutions need to upgrade their data and analytics capabilities to enable new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict and detect financial crimes. In this paper, we put a step towards AI-enabled financial crime detection in general and money laundering detection in particular to address this challenge.

This has put increasing pressure on banks to monitor and report a range of intricate exposures to comply with new prudential requirements. Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an emerging technology trend leveraging Information Technology and Digital Innovations that can greatly assist with a bank’s regulatory management process. A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned. RegTech can provide an invaluable tool, in a business-as-usual environment, as well as in real-life stress events, such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak. This paper explores the potential of RegTech and the merit of incorporating it into a smart Treasury department. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Coronavirus; Digital technology; Innovation; Regulations and compliance; Regulatory Technology (RegTech); Smart Treasury",,"Grundke, P., Kuhn, A., The impact of the Basel III liquidity ratios on banks: Evidence from a simulation study (2020) The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 75, pp. 167-190; Fidrmuc, J., Lind, R., Macroeconomic impact of Basel III: Evidence from a meta-analysis (2020) Journal of Banking & Finance, 112, p. 105359; Boora, K.K., The impact of Basel III norms on profitability: An empirical study of Indian public sector banks (2018) IUP Journal of Financial Risk Management, 15 (3), pp. 44-58. , https://0-search.ebscohost.com.ujlink.uj.ac.za/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=133637292&site=ehost-live&scope=site.Accessed12Aug2020; Auboin, M., Blengini, I., The impact of Basel III on trade finance: The potential unintended consequences of the leverage ratio (2019) Journal of Banking Regulation, 20 (2), pp. 115-123; Roulet, C., Basel III: effects of capital and liquidity regulations on European bank lending (2018) Journal of Economics and Business, 95, pp. 26-46; Basheer, M.F., Hidthiir, M.H., Waemustafa, W., Impact of bank regulatory change and bank specific factors upon off-balance-sheet activities across commercial banks in south Asia (2019) Asian Economic and Financial Review, 9 (4), pp. 419-431. , http://www.aessweb.com/journals/April2019/5002/4531.Accessed12Aug2020; Alam, N., Ngo, K., Regulatory compliance and cost of banking operation: A survey of US banking sector (2014) Journal of International Banking Law & Regulation, 29 (11), pp. 657-664; Allen, M., Cost of compliance (2014) San Diego Business Journal, 35 (36), p. 15. , https://0-search.ebscohost.com.ujlink.uj.ac.za/login.aspx?direct=true&db=f5h&AN=98203184&site=ehost-live&scope=site; Howard, C., Basel III’s corporate governance impact: How increased banking regulations pose challenges to corporate compliance while simultaneously furthering stakeholder objectives (2014) Journal of Business Ethics, 9 (1), pp. 39-49. , https://0-search.ebscohost.com.ujlink.uj.ac.za/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=99899582&site=ehost-live&scope=site.Accessed12Aug2020; Financial Service Authority. 2019.

Associated with this has been the rise of regulatory technology (Regtech) in that sector. However, the major application of Regtech in financial services is as a tool for regulatory compliance, rather than for regulatory enforcement. This article explores an approach to applying Regtech techniques to antitrust enforcement. It does this by applying those techniques to the detection of resale price maintenance (vertical price fixing). The exploration is limited to pricing on e-commerce platforms such as AliExpress, eBay, and Amazon Marketplace. The Regtech application is effected by presenting the literature and cases on resale price maintenance and the application of the law in Australia, the US, and the EU. The article examines the application of machine learning in the Regtech environment and the ways in which application programming interfaces could be used. The article proposes approaches to machine learning solutions for the detection of potentially infringing resale price maintenance conduct. It also presents the basis of an algorithm for detecting that conduct. © 2020 The Author(s).","antitrust; competition law; Fintech; Regtech; resale price maintenance; vertical price fixing",,"Arner, Douglas W, Barberis, Janos, Buckley, Ross P, The Evolution of Fintech: A New Post-Crisis Paradigm (2016) University of New South Wales Law Research Series, 62, p. 38; Arner, Douglas W, Barberis, Janos, Buckley, Ross P, FinTech, RegTech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law & Business, 37, p. 371. , 373; Currie, Wendy L, Gozman, Daniel P, Seddon, Jonathan JMM, Dialectic Tensions in the Financial Markets: A Longitudinal Study of Pre- and Post-Crisis Regulatory Technology (2018) Journal of Information Technology, 33, p. 304; Lee, Emily, (2017) Financial Inclusion: A Challenge to the New Paradigm of Financial Technology, Regulatory Technology and Anti-Money Laundering Law, , SSRN 3018960; Micheler, Eva, Whaley, Anna, (2018) Regulatory Technology: Replacing Law with Computer Code, (14). , 2018 4; Colaert, Veerle, (2015) RegTech as a Response to Regulatory Expansion in the Financial Sector, p. 1; Baxter, LG, Adaptive Financial Regulation and Regtech: A Concept Article on Realistic Protection for Victims of Bank Failures (2016) Duke Law Journal, 66, p. 567. , 567; Sanchez-Graells, A, ""Screening for Cartels"" in Public Procurement: Cheating at Solitaire to Sell Fool's Gold?'

The study tried to address the general concept of electronic Signatures and the essential legal laws that regulate its application. Based on the analysis of the reality of the electronic Signature’s uses and applications in Palestine, the researcher found that it is not applied at all in all banking and non-banking financial sectors. It is only adopted at the Palestine Stock Exchange. The electronic Signature is optional in most transactions and trades between the Stock Exchange and the brokerage firms and their clients, which are conducted electronically. The study also tried to shed some light on and highlight the most critical legal and illegal obstacles that hinder using and applying electronic Signatures in the Palestinian business sector. The researchers came up with many recommendations. The most important recommendation relates to the establishment of an electronic transactions unit as stipulated in the Law and that it should be independent. They also recommended that the private sector companies be allowed to design and implement the programs necessary for electronic Signatures and the protection and securing of the electronic Signature. © Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH.

Part of the solution appears to be programming compliance into RegTech: technological solutions that facilitate compliance with and monitoring of regulatory requirements. In this contribution, we have distinguished three types of RegTech based on the party taking the initiative for its development: (i) Compliance RegTech, where financial institutions develop or acquire RegTech tools to facilitate compliance; (ii) Supervisory RegTech, where a supervisor imposes the use of a certain RegTech tool to facilitate compliance, supervision and/or enforcement; and (iii) Regulatory RegTech, where the regulator provides machine-readable and/or machine-executable regulation. This approach allows for a nuanced analysis of the benefits and challenges of RegTech, and of the changing role of supervisors in a RegTech era. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation (2017) Nw J Int’l L & Bus, 37, p. 371; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., (2017) FinTech and RegTech in a Nutshell, and the Future in a Sandbox, 3 (4). , Research Foundation Briefs July; Arner, D.W., Zetzsche, D.A., Buckley, R.P., Barberis, J.N., FinTech and RegTech.

Many organisations appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to assist them with their demonstration of compliance with the GDPR Principle of Accountability. The challenge for the DPO is to monitor these complex processing activities and to advise and inform the organisation with regard to the organisations demonstration of compliance with the Principle of Accountability. A review of GDPR compliance software solutions shows that organisations are being greatly challenged in meeting compliance obligations as set out under the GDPR, despite the myriad of software tools available to them. Many organisations continue to take a manual and informal approach to GDPR compliance. Our analysis shows significant gaps on the part of GDPR tools in their ability to demonstrate compliance in that they lack interoperability features, and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility. In contrast, RegTech has brought great success to financial compliance, using technological solutions to facilitate compliance with, and the monitoring of regulatory requirements. A review of the State of the Art identified the four success features of a RegTech system to be, strong data governance, automation through technology, interoperability of systems and a proactive regulatory framework. This paper outlines a set of requirements for GDPR compliance tools based on the RegTech experience and evaluate how these success features could be applied to improve GDPR compliance. A proof of concept prototype GDPR compliance tool was explored using the four success factors of RegTech, in which RegTech best practice was applied to regulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if the demonstration of GDPR compliance could be improved. The application of a RegTech success factors provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech can deliver and can facilitate organisations in meeting their GDPR compliance obligations. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Accountability; Compliance; Data protection officer; GDPR; RegTech","Demonstrations; Information systems; Information use; Interoperability; Privacy by design; Complex processing; Data governances; Geographical locations; Heterogeneous processing; Regulatory frameworks; Regulatory requirements; Software solution; Technological solution; Regulatory compliance","Buttarelli, G., The EU GDPR as a clarion call for a new global digital gold standard (2016) Int.

Many financial institutions are struggling with ever-changing regulatory requirements and the increased burden of intricate rules. Such rules can be conflicting, and subjected to local implementation and jurisdictic interpretation. Non-compliance or the inability to meet the deadlines subject institutions to hefty penalties and multimillion-dollar fines for failures in controlling nefarious and over-the-counter trading activities. In this chapter, we map out ongoing regulatory milestones globally to understand the main supervisory priorities by territory and propose how financial institutions can successfully administer regulatory change through an AI-driven regulatory management model within their organizations. We discuss the evolution, challenges and recommendations for financial institutions (including Shariah compliance) in the change management for regulations using a structured approach that addresses regional priorities. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-money laundering; Customer due diligence; Data privacy and protection; OTC reform",,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern J.

The banking industry changed massively after the financial crisis of 2008. New regulations and enforcements are being imposed on banks causing the compliance cost to increase dramatically. RegTech has been invented by technology firms acting as a potential solution to banks. The study will demonstrate the ability of RegTech to reduce the compliance cost, strengthen money laundering prevention and reduce the reputational risk in banking sectors. This study target sample was banks’ employees in Bahrain because of their proper knowledge about anti-money laundering. Data were collected from 100 respondents from the banking sector of Bahrain. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze the data while regression model and Spearman’s correlation were used to test the hypothesis. The results of this analysis indicate that RegTech has positive impact on strengthening and enhancing money laundering prevention in banks. The findings of the study will help banks understand the effectiveness of RegTech solutions, raise bankers’ awareness about the new technologies and provide insight for regulators about RegTech capabilities in preventing money laundering. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.","Anti-money laundering; Bahrain; Regulatory technology (RegTech)","Banking; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Anti-money laundering; Banking industry; Compliance costs; Descriptive analysis; Exploratory studies; Financial crisis; Money laundering; Regression model; Laundering","(2018) Implications of fintech developments for banks and banks supervisors, , https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d431.pdf, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision; (2012), CAMS: Study Guide for the CAMS Certification Examination (5th Ed).

Bahrain has strived to position itself as the banking center of the Arabian Gulf, hence the results of this novel research are informative of the practices in the region. The primary data for this study was collected through a survey instrument distributed to 100 bankers working in Bahrain with expertise in compliance. The results of multivariate analysis indicate that transactions monitoring through RegTech and cost- and time-saving aspects of RegTech, drive money laundering prevention effectiveness to a highly statistically significant extent. However, electronic know your customer (KYC) technologies are insignificant as drivers.

From the hits of that information retrieval process, we select 55 articles outlining the application of information technology in regulatory affairs with an emphasis on the financial sector. In comparison, we examine the technological scope of 347 RegTech companies and compare our findings with the scientific literature. Our research reveals that ‘compliance management’ is the most relevant topic in practice, and ‘risk management’ is the primary subject in research.

A financial service regulation has inflated at an astounding rate since the financial crisis and, therefore, has the price tag of regulatory compliance. Many start-ups have begun to apply digital technological knowledge including APIs, AI, RPAs, and many more to these immediate, numerous, and burdensome tasks to meet the terms and regulations, hence the emergence of RegTech. This study examines the implications for financial institutions and regulation particularly when technology poses a confront to the global banking and regulatory system. It attempts to examine the characteristics and applications of RegTech in the world of regulatory compliance. It also illustrates a model to define the transformation of present workload to proposed workload of regulatory compliance with an application of RegTech. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Further, theoretical support for the role of internal corporate whistleblowers can be found in the smart regulation paradigm, which points to the potential for whistleblowers to operate as surrogate regulators. In light of this, the potential impact of fast-developing ‘RegTech’ applications on corporate whistleblowing activity has significant regulatory implications. While ‘first’ generation RegTech applications such as improved data analytics already have the capability to assist corporations to implement more efficient internal whistleblowing systems, the rise of second-generation AI-powered RegTech technologies is likely to further disrupt, and potentially transform, the practice of whistleblowing in corporations. As AI advances, internal corporate whistleblowers may be supplemented, or even replaced, by ‘whistlebots’ with the ability to report autonomously, with dramatic implications for the role of whistleblowing as a corporate regulatory device. © 2020, University of New South Wales Law Journal.

However, the application of technological solutions to reduce compliance costs in supervising financial activities can interfere with the intervention of regulators. The extent to which compliance with the regulation can be automated by technologies raises the question whether the manual intervention is still required. This article examines the potential of RegTech solutions to automate rules and principles.

The paper analyses these four pillars and suggests that together they are underpinning the development of a RegTech ecosystem in Europe and will continue to do so. We argue that the European Union’s financial services and data protection regulatory reforms have unintentionally driven the use of regulatory technologies (RegTech) by intermediaries, supervisors and regulators, and provided an environment within which RegTech can flourish. The experiences of Europe in this process will provide insights for other societies in developing their own RegTech ecosystems in order to support more efficient, stable, inclusive financial systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Data protection; Digital identity; European Union; Financial regulation; FinTech; General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); Open banking; Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD 2); RegTech",,"Buckley, R.P., Arner, D.W., (2011) From crisis to crisis: The global financial system and regulatory failure, , Kluwer Law International, The Netherlands; Buckley, R.P., Avgouleas, E., Arner, D.W., (2016) Reconceptualizing global finance and its regulation, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., Fintech, RegTech and the Reconceptualisation of Financial Regulation (2017) Northwest J Int Law Bus., 37 (3), pp. 371-413; (2016) RegTech in financial services: Technology solutions for compliance and reporting, p. 25. , Institute of International Finance, Washington, DC; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The Emergence of Regtech 2.0: From Know Your Customer to Know Your Data (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation., 44, pp. 79-98; Enriques, L., Financial Supervisors and Regtech: Four Roles and Four Challenges (2017) Revue Trimestrielle De Droit Financier., 53, pp. 1-9; Directive, 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers and amending Directives 2003/41/EC and 2009/65/EC and Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009 and (EU) No 1095/2010 (2011) OJ L, 174. , 1 July; (2012) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories, 201. , 27 July; Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (2013) OJ L, 176, p. 27. , June; Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (2013) OG L, 176, p. 27. , June; Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (2014) OJ L, 173, p. 12. , June; OJ L, 119. , of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), 4 May 2016; Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (2015) OJ, 337, p. 35. , of 23 Dec, L; Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC (2014) OJ L, 257, p. 28. , Aug; Zetzsche, D.A., Buckley, R.P., Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., From FinTech to TechFin: The Regulatory Challenges of Data-Driven Finance (2018) NYU J Law Bus., 14 (2), pp. 393-446; Cohen, J., What Privacy Is For (2013) Harvard Law Rev., 126 (7), pp. 1904-1932; Barocas, S., Selbst, A., Big Data’s Disparate Impact (2016) Calif Law Rev., 104 (3), pp. 671-732; The IoT is a network of devices and applications containing software, electronics, actuators and connectivity that allows these things to connect, interact and exchange data; Weber, R.H., Weber, R., (2010) Internet of things: Legal perspectives, , Springer, Berlin; Russel, S., Norvig, P., (2009) Artifical intelligence: A modern approach, , 3, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ; Zetzsche, D.A., Buckley, R.P., Arner, D.W., The Distributed Liabilty of Distributed Ledgers: Legal Risks of Blockchain (2018) Univ Ill Law Rev., 4, pp. 1361-1406; Rodrigues, U., Law and the Blockchain (2019) Iowa Law Review, 104 (2), pp. 679-729; Sklaroff, J., Smart Contracts and the Cost of Inflexibility (2017) University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 166 (1), pp. 263-303; Werbach, L., Cornell, N., Contracts Ex Machina (2017) Duke Law Review, 67 (2), pp. 313-370; Weber, R.H., Smart Contracts: Do We Need New Legal Rules?

The concept of Regulatory Technology, or RegTech, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is still in the infant stage due to lack of defined processes and it holds immense potential in employing RegTech to its existing institutions. The purpose of this paper is to understand the various factors that determine the adoption for RegTech services and proposes a multi-criteria decision-making approach by ranking those determinants. The determinants are divided into three main hierarchies which include customers, regulators, and environment-based factors. Survey was conducted to rank each of the determinants within the hierarchy to validate the need for RegTech services. It is observed that customer-centric experience, enhancing data security and ensuring real-time data capabilities play the major factors for the implementation of RegTech services that is validated by constructing an AHP model. The need for RegTech's determinants would help financial institutions, regulators, and stakeholders in the UAE benefit from the research and achieve competitive advantage by understanding and implementing the suggested findings.

We would like to examine the experiences of technology integration applied to the regulation of the markets and to the compliace, in the banking sector in Italy. Our paper responds to a gap in literature that on the subject of regtech is mainly based on legal, defining arguments and about reviewing the literature on the macro context and the issues generated by the huge amount of regulation. The article will explore three cases of RegTech companies in Italy presenting advantages and criticalities in the adoption of regtech solutions on the Italian market. Methods/Approach: Today the literature about case study in RegTech is not proposing any solution of cooperation on the regulatory field in Italy. So we have to fill the gap we find in exploration of literature. An analysis in the field cannot be separated from a preliminary systematic review of the literature on regulatory case studies. We begin our scientific analysis of the subject through a preliminary literature review individuating any case study around RegTech through exploratory case study. Due to the scarcity of papers about case study in RegTech field, we adopt an approach already used for well-studied cases widespread in the FinTech area and an exploratory investigation through in deep interviews following models used in FinTech area and in ERM field. Results/Findings: In this article, we will, therefore, propose case studies in the FinTech sector applied to regulatory technology in Italy and we expect to answer the following research questions: We present three RegTech's cases in Italy's financial system exposing the fields of collaboration with financial institutions in RegTech field between incumbents and RegTech industries. We expose also how big I.T. companies, which are providing services for banks, are refocusing and improving compliance through RegTech to provide services linked to compliance, Kyc, Aml, privacy, payments to the incumbents. In conclusion we express topics interested by cooperation between banks and RegTech companies describing the potetial expansion lines. Implications: Understand how financial companies through regulatory technology can: Improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. Improve prudential compliance, anti money laundering and customer protection. Reduce the risks of traditional banking business through better knowledge and customer identification and profiling may also offer more favourable terms to companies and lowering compliance costs to shift economic resources towards FinTech's disruptive innovation. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The rate at which technology has developed in terms of tasks that are complex, technical and time-consuming has been astounding. The purpose of this paper is to explore the solutions that AI, RegTech and CharityTech provide to charities in navigating the vast amount of anti-money laundering and counter-terror finance legislation in the UK; so that they comply with the requirements and mitigate the potential risk they face but also develop a more coherent and streamlined set of actions. Design/methodology/approach: The subject is approached through the analysis of data, literature and, domestic and international regulation. The first part of the paper explores the current obligations and risks charities face, these are then, in the second part, set against the examination of potential technological solutions as of August 2020. Findings: It is suggested that charities underestimate the importance of the nature and size of the threat posed to them, this is significant, as demonstrated, given the growing size and impact of the sector. Technological solutions are suggested to combat the issues charities face. Originality/value: The study is original because it is the first to create the notion of CharityTech and to specifically explore what technological advances can assist charities in meeting the regulatory compliance challenge. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anti-money laundering; Artificial intelligence; CharityTech; Counter-terror finance; English law; RegTech",,"(2020) Mitigating human bias in AI, , www.research.ibm.com/5-in-5/ai-and-bias/, accessed 31 March 2020; Barr, W., Shell charities and terrorist financing: a sledgehammer to crack a shell?

A survey of GDPR compliance software solutions shows significant gaps in their ability to demonstrate compliance. In contrast, RegTech has recently brought great success to financial compliance, resulting in reduced risk, cost saving and enhanced financial regulatory compliance. It is shown that many GDPR solutions lack interoperability features such as standard APIs, meta-data or reports and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility. A proof of concept prototype was explored using a regulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if RegTech best practice could improve the demonstration of GDPR compliance. The application of a RegTech approach provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech can deliver. This paper demonstrates a RegTech approach to GDPR compliance can facilitate an organisation meeting its accountability obligations.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on two online Delphi surveys sent to a panel of international experts composed of eight specially recruited professionals and specialists of anti-financial crime compliance and RegTech, five main predictions have been developed. Findings: It was found that artificial intelligence would become the most impactful technology for financial institutions to fight financial crime, and that there will be a strong positive correlation between ever-more elaborated compliance programs and the level of sophistication of methods used for money laundering. Furthermore, the panel designated regulators’ recommendations as likely to be less influential than RegTech solutions, and the time required to integrate RegTech solutions for AML compliance as the main future challenge. Originality/value: These predictions are meant to provide financial institutions and regulators with useful outlooks. While the reviewed literature focused on the role of regulations on the evolution of money laundering, this study puts stress on RegTech solutions and their impact on both compliance and financial crime. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Compliance; Financial crime; Money laundering; RegTech; Technology",,"(2017) Evolving AML journey, , www.accenture.com/t00010101t000000z__w__/gb-en/_acnmedia/pdf-61/accenture-leveraging-machine-learning-anti-money-laundering-transaction-monitoring.pdf; Anagnostopoulos, I., Fintech and regtech: Impact on regulators and banks (2018) Journal of Economics and Business, 100, pp. 7-25; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37 (3), pp. 373-415. , https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/njilb/vol37/iss3/2; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The emergence of regtech 2.0: from know your customer to know your data (2016) Journal of Financial Transformation, 44, pp. 79-86. , https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:ris:jofitr:1576; Araujo, R.A., An evolutionary game theory approach to combat money laundering (2010) Journal of Money Laundering Control, 13 (1), pp. 70-78. , https://doi.org/10.1108/13685201011010236; Baldwin, G., The new face of money laundering (2003) Journal of Investment Compliance (Compliance), 4 (1), p. 38; Barone, R., Masciandaro, D., Organized crime, money laundering and legal economy: Theory and simulations (2011) European Journal of Law and Economics, 32 (1), pp. 115-142. , https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:kap:ejlwec:v:32:y:2011:i:1:p:115-142; Bergström, M., The many uses of anti-Money laundering regulation – over time and into the future (2018) German Law Journal, 19 (5), p. 1149. , http://search.ebscohost.com.thebe.icn-nancy.fr/login.aspx?direct=true&db=edb&AN=132846601&site=eds-live&scope=site; Butler, T., Brooks, R., On the role of ontology-based RegTech for managing risk and compliance reporting in the age of regulation (2017) Journal of Risk Management in Financial Institutions, 11 (1), pp. 19-33. , http://search.ebscohost.com.thebe.icn-nancy.fr/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=128878068&site=eds-live&scope=site; (2019) The global financial crisis and its unforeseen consequences, , http://coriolistechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Ten-years-on-from-the-GFCvFinal2.pdf, Retrieved from; Crosman, P., Is regulators’ green light on AML tech a game changer?

The trends of FinTech distribution in Ukraine are considered. The areas of activity of traditional financial intermediaries, which require the use of the latest technological tools, the possible effects of the influence of modern regulatory standards on the banking sphere are studied. The authors describe features of RegTech application for improvement financial intermediaries risk management systems, usage of innovative regulatory technology tools that can enhance the quality and efficiency of financial institutions compliance systems as a prerequisite for increasing the protection of depositors, creditors and investors interests. New opportunities for cooperation between traditional financial intermediaries and RegTech companies are examined.

Services computing researchers will play an important role in advancing Regtech, but they must add to their repertoire additional knowledge of financial principles, an understanding of common Fintech pathologies that may be exploited by bad actors, and new thinking in regard to protecting customer data across multiple legal jurisdictions and the related compliance of boundary crossing banking-related algorithms. This paper uses supply chain finance as a use case to demonstrate details of this needed new repertoire. Ten areas of goal and constraint resetting relevant to Regtech software development and traditional services computing approaches are discussed. At stake is the need for services computing scholars to engage in developing some of the most critical software services of our age - those that can help to maintain and advance our market-based societies. © 2019 IEEE.","Fintech; Regtech; Supply Chain Finance","Commerce; Contracts; Finance; Regulatory compliance; Supply chains; Additional knowledge; Financial principles; Fintech; Regtech; Related algorithms; Supply chain finances; Traditional services; Transparent process; Software design","(2018) Regtech to Account for 40% of Global Compliance Spend by 2023, Rising Sixfold to %115 Billion, , https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/regtechto-account-for-40-per-cent-of-global5/1/2019, Juniper Research '; Mooney, C.W., Fintech and secured transactions systems of the future (2018) Law and Contemporary Problems, pp. 1-20; Tsai, C.H., Peng, K.J., The fintech revolution and financial regulation: The case of online supply-chain financing (2017) Asian Journal of Law and Society, 4, pp. 109-131; Regtech for regulators: Rearchitecting the system for better regulation (2018) World Government Summit, pp. 1-33; Zetzsche, D., Arner, D.W., Buckley, R.P., Weber, R.H., The future of data-driven finance and Regtech: Lessons from EU Big Bang II (2019) EBI Working Paper Series, pp. 1-51; Moretto, A., Grassi, L., Caniato, F., Giorgino, M., Ronchi, S., Supply chain finance; from traditional supply chain to supply chain credit rating (2019) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 25, pp. 197-217; Kilu, E., Milani, F., Scott, E., Pfahl, D., Agile software process improvement by learning rom financial and Fintech companies: LHV bank case study (2019) Software Quality: The Complexity and Challenges of Software Engineering and Software Quality in the Cloud, pp. 57-69. , D.

It draws on the findings and outcomes of a five-year research programme to highlight the role that RegTech can play in making regulatory compliance more efficient and effective. The chapter presents research on the Bank of England/Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) RegTech Sprint initiative, whose objective was to demonstrate how straight-through processing of regulations and regulatory compliance reporting using semantically enabled applications can be made possible by RegTech. The chapter notes that the full benefits of RegTech will only materialise if the pitfalls of a fragmented Tower of Babel approach are avoided. Semantic standards, we argue, are the key to all this. © 2019, The Author(s).","FinTech; RegTech; Semantic technologies; Standards",,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckey, R.P., FinTech, RegTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2016) Northwestern Journal of International Law & Business, 37, pp. 371-414; Bamberger, K.A., Technologies of compliance: Risk and regulation in a digital age (2009) Texas Law Review, 88, pp. 669-739; Butler, T., Towards a standards-based technology architecture for RegTech (2017) Journal of Financial Transformation, 45, pp. 49-59; A 3-D stacked wire bondless silicon carbide power module (2016) 2016 IEEE 4Th Workshop on Wide Bandgap Power Devices and Applications (Wipda), pp. 11-16; Heiler, S., Semantic interoperability (1995) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 27 (2), pp. 271-273; (2017) Regdelta: Part of Our Mifid II Solution, , https://jwg-it.eu/insight/mifid-programme-planner/.

Every year, these requirements are increasing and it has become a challenge for financial institutions to meet the requirements manually, due to the high cost and increasing number of complex compliance requirements. These compliance challenges created the market for RegTech, which is a part of FinTech industry, where the RegTech industry promise to act as a solution to reduce compliance cost and burden for financial institutions as well as regulators. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic literature review conducted, on applying RegTech to reduce compliance cost and burden, while focusing on promising RegTech tools and various benefits and challenges of RegTech. The area of RegTech is very recent, which results in a gap in literature and research for the purpose of this review.

It also examines the potential impact FinTech has on the riskiness of banks and proposes RegTech as the solution. Following a brief overview of the impact and costs of regulation since the financial crisis, the paper introduces RegTech in the context of challenges facing financial institutions and the limitations of governance, risk and compliance (GRC) systems. This paper’s main contribution is in its delineation of a regulatory compliance and risk ontology, the technologies that underpin it and the related objective-risk-control (ORC) model. The paper argues that these provide a platform on which RegTech can perform effective risk management and compliance reporting in a global post-crisis regulatory environment. © Henry Stewart Publications 1752-8887 (2018).","Compliance reporting; Fintech; Regtech; Regulation; Risk management; Semantic technology",,"Taylor, H., (2007) The Joy of SOX, , Wiley Publishing, Inc., Indianapolis, Ind; McClean, C., Rasmussen, M.T., (2007) The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Governance, Risk, and Compliance Platforms, , Forrester Inc., Cambridge, MA, 21st December; (2017) Regdelta: Part of Our Mifid II Solution, , https://jwg-it.eu/insight/mifid-programme-planner/, accessed 25th October, 2017; Grasshoff, G., Mogul, Z., Pfuhler, T., Gittfried, N., Wiegand, C., Bohn, A., Vonhoff, V., (2017) Global Risk 2017: Staying the Course In, , https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/financial-institutions-growth-global-risk-2017-staying-course-banking.aspx, available at, (accessed 25th October, 2017); Memminger, M., Baxter, M., Lin, E., (2016) Banking Regtechs to the Rescue?, Bain Brief, , http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/banking-regtechs-to-the-rescue.aspx, 18th September, available at, (accessed 25th October, 2017); McDowell, H., Banks spent close to $100 billion on compliance last year (2017) The Trade, , https://www.thetradenews.com/Sell-side/Banks-spent-close-to-$100-billion-on-compliance-last-year/, accessed 25th October, 2017; Marenzi, M., (2017) Capital Markets and Investment Banking 2017–2018 Forecast, , http://www.opimas.com/research/193/detail/, accessed 25th October, 2017; Peirce, H., Robinson, I., Stratmann, T., How are small banks faring under Dodd-Frank?

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation",,"Accenture, Global fintech investment growth continues in 2016 driven by Europe and Asia, accenture study finds (2016), https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/global-fintech-investment-growth-continues-in-2016-driven-by-europe-and-asia-accenture-study-finds.htm, April 13 News Release; Agarwal, S., Lucca, D., Seru, A., Trebbi, F., Inconsistent regulators: Evidence from banking (2014) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 129 (2), pp. 889-938; Aggarwal, R., Stein, P., The complex regulatory landscape for FinTech: An Uncertain future for small and medium-sized enterprise lending (2016), World Economic Forum White Paper No. 170816; Allan, G., Hagiwara, Y., Japan regulation shakeup is seen as a game changer for banks (2018), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/japan-finance-regulation-shakeup-seen-as-game-changer-for-banks, February 26, Accessed 10/03/2018 Bloomberg; Allen, F., Gale, D., Financial intermediaries and markets (2004) Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society, 72 (4), pp. 1023-1061; Allen, F., Gale, D., Understanding financial crises, clarendon lectures in finance (2007), Oxford University Press; Allen, F., Gale, D., Bubbles and crises (2000) The Economic Journal, 110 (460), pp. 236-255; Allen, F., Gale, D., Financial contagion (2000) The Journal of Political Economy, 108 (1), pp. 1-33; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the Re- conceptualization of financial regulation (2017) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37 (3), pp. 371-413; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J.N., Buckley, R.P., The evolution of FinTech: A new post-crisis paradigm?

This would be achieved by sharing certain elements of the dynamic transaction document on a bearer service, based on a federation of distribution ledgers; such a quasi-simultaneous sharing of risk data becomes possible because the dynamic transaction document maintain a record of state in semi-real time, and this state can be verified by anybody with access to the distribution ledgers, also in semi-real time. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a novel, regular technology (RegTech) cum automated legal text approach for financial transaction as well as financial risk reporting that is based on cutting-edge distributed computing and decentralised data management technologies such as distributed ledger (Swanson, 2015), distributed storage (Arner et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2013; Caron et al., 2014), algorithmic financial contract standards (Brammertz and Mendelowitz, 2014; Breymann and Mendelowitz, 2015; Braswell, 2016), automated legal text (Hazard and Haapio, 2017) and document engineering methods and techniques (Glushko and McGrath, 2005). This approach is equally inspired by the concept of the “bearer service” and its capacity to span over existing and future technological systems and substrates (Kavassalis et al., 2000; Clark, 1988). Findings: The result is a transformation of supervisors’ capacity to monitor risk in the financial system based on data which preserve informational content of financial instruments at the most granular level, in combination with a mathematically robust time stamping approach using blockchain technology. Practical implications: The RegTech approach has the potential to contain operational risk linked to inadequate handling of risk data and to rein in compliance cost of supervisory reporting. Originality value: The present RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and supervisory reporting is the first integration of algorithmic financial data standards with blockchain functionality. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Algorithmic standards; Document engineering; RegTech; Smart contracts",,"Acharya, V.V., Mehran, H., Thakor, A.V., Caught between Scylla and Charybdis?

At the juncture of these phenomena lies regulatory technology or “RegTech”—the use of technology, particularly information technology, in the context of regulatory monitoring, reporting, and compliance. Regulating rapidly transforming financial systems requires increasing the use of and reliance on RegTech. Whilst the principal regulatory objectives (e.g., financial stability, prudential safety and soundness, consumer protection and market integrity, and market competition and development) remain, their means of application are increasingly inadequate. RegTech developments are leading towards a paradigm shift necessitating the reconceptualization of financial regulation. RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater – it has the potential to enable a nearly real-time and proportionate regulatory regime that identifies and addresses risk while facilitating more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach at the nexus of data, digital identity, and regulation. This paper seeks to expose the inadequacy of digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world, sets the foundation for a practical understanding of RegTech, and proposes sequenced reforms that could benefit regulators, industry, and entrepreneurs in the financial sector and other industries. © 2017.

While a few isolated suits might be successful in cases where there is provable fraud, such remedies are no general panacea for preventing large-scale bank-inflicted losses. Large losses are nearly always the result of unforeseeable or suddenly changing economic conditions, poor business judgment, or inadequate regulatory supervision-usually a combination of all three. Yet regulators face an increasingly complex task in supervising modern financial institutions. This Article explains how the challenge has become so difficult. It argues for preserving regulatory discretion rather than reducing it through formal congressional direction. The Article also asserts that regulators have to develop their own sophisticated methods of automated supervision. Although also not a panacea, the development of ""RegTech"" solutions will help clear away volumes of work that understaffed and underfunded regulators cannot keep up with. RegTech will not eliminate policy considerations, nor will it render regulatory decisions noncontroversial. Nevertheless, a sophisticated deployment of RegTech should help focus regulatory discretion and public-policy debate on the elements of regulation where choices really matter. © 2016 Lawrence G.
