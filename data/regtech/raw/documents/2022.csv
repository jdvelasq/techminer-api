Using a two-stage least squares instrumental variable regression approach and correcting for cross-sectional dependency, simultaneity, and endogeneity of regressors, the results establish a positive link between fintech and financial development. Our findings show that fintech supports financial sector development by enhancing access (loans), depth (deposits), and savings within China’s financial institutions. We also show that the emergence of fintech in the area of financial regulation (regulatory technology: regtech) can significantly improve financial development outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative for regulators to pursue policies that balance growth in the fintech sector while mitigating the associated risks. In addition, we use the difference-in-differences approach to show that policy measures such as interest rates liberalization also positively impacted financial development during the analysis period. In our conclusion, we suggest a policy framework for balanced fintech sector growth in developing countries. © 2022, The Author(s).","China; Financial development; Fintech; Regtech",,"The financial assistance provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71774071), the National Statistical Science Research Project (2021LY055); Jiangsu Soft Science Research Project (BR2021030); Zhenjiang Soft Science Research Project (RK2021010); and the Key Academic Research Project of Jiaxing University (ICCPR2021007) is highly appreciated by researchers of this study.",,"(2018) Mind the gap: The challenges to fintech adaption, , FinTech Innovation Lab.

Nevertheless, previous research neglects that the output of RegTech applications has to be explainable and non-discriminatory. Within this study, we propose design principles and features for a RegTech approach which provides automated assessments of financial consumer complaints. We follow three main design principles. First, we build upon information diagnosticity theory to address the need for explainable classifications empowering regulators to justify their actions. Second, we consider a bag-of-words representation and ensemble learning to ensure high classification accuracy. Third, we take into account author characteristics to avoid discriminating classifications. We evaluate our approach in the financial services industry and show its value for identifying consumer complaints resulting in monetary compensations. The proposed design principles and features are highly relevant for regulators, corporations as well as consumers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer complaints; Explainable AI; Fair AI; Predictive analytics; Regulatory enforcement; Regulatory technology (RegTech)","Classification (of information); Automated monitoring; Consumer complaints; Data-source; Design features; Design Principles; Explainable AI; Fair AI; Regulatory enforcement; Regulatory technology; Technology application; Predictive analytics",,,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckey, R.P., FinTech, RegTech, and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2016) Nw.

In effect, if this technology is applied in the right way, it could be used to overcome the social and economic gaps that exist worldwide. Justification: However, until now, the specific legal regimes (RegTech) that have been established for Fintech have, in addition to the general lack of confidence in new technologies, made its implementation more difficult. Nevertheless, in order to consolidate Fintech, it is necessary to design suitable regulation to transform these new technologies into ordinary instruments of our financial system. Objective: Therefore, in order to promote an appropriate RegTech that allows for the progress of Fintech, it is necessary to analyse the legal problems that restrict their expansion by using an analytical methodology and a bibliographic compilation of legal resolutions. Main conclusion: Legal personal data protection is the main obstacle that must be overcome by paying attention to the guarantees inherent to this fundamental right. In this way, if the legal system is to be ready for the Digital Revolution, society must not be worried about either the loss of rights or increases in inequalities. ©","algorithmic transparency; big data; data protection; Fintech sustainability; RegTech",,,,"Consens, B., Gunderson, L., Allen, C., Benson, M.H., (2014) Identifying Legal, Ecological and Governance Obstacles, and Opportunities for Adapting to Climate Change, 6. , Sustainability 2339; Butler, T., Towards a Standards-Based Technology Architecture for RegTech (2017) Journal of Financial Transformation, 45, p. 49; Rodríguez Ballano, S., Habemus Nuevo Reglamento General de Proteccíon de Datos"" (2016) 919 Actualidad Jurídica Aranzadi, 9; Falcone, P.M., Morone, P., Sica, E., (2018) Greening of the Financial System and Fuelling A Sustainability Transition, , A Discursive Approach to Assess Landscape Pressures on the Italian Financial System","Cruz Rambaud, S.; Department of Economics and Business, La Cañada de San Urbano, Spain; email: scruz@ual.es","Cambridge University Press",1867299X,,,,"English","Eur.

Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain. This study uses a design science research methodology, a text mining technique, and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the development trends concerning the presentation of the product or service information on a company's website. This study applies regulatory technology (RegTech) as a case to analyze and justify the emerging cross-disciplinary trend. Furthermore, an experimental study is conducted using the Google search engine to verify and validate the proposed research mechanism at the end of this study. The study results reveal that, compared with Google Trends and Google Correlate, the research mechanism proposed in this study is more illustrative, feasible, and promising because it reduces noise and avoids the additional time and effort required to perform a further in-depth exploration to obtain the information. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

To establish its effectiveness in meeting this obligation, we evaluate an ROPA semantic model, the Common Semantic Model–ROPA (CSM–ROPA). Semantic models and tools represent one solution to the compliance challenges faced by organisations: the heterogeneity of relevant data sources, and the lack of tool interoperability and agreed common standards. By surveying current practice and the literature we identify the requirements for GDPR accountability tools: digital exchange of data, automated accountability verification and privacy-aware data governance. A case study was conducted to analyse the expressivity and effectiveness of CSM–ROPA when used as an interoperable, machine-readable mediation layer to express the concepts in a comprehensive regulator-provided accountability framework used for GDPR compliance. We demonstrate that CSM–ROPA can express 98% of ROPA accountability terms and fully express nine of the ten European regulators' ROPA templates. We identify three terms for addition to CSM–ROPA, and we identify areas where CSM–ROPA relies on partial matches that indicate model limitations. These improvements to CSM–ROPA will provide comprehensive coverage of the regulator-supplied model. We show that tools based on CSM–ROPA can fully meet the requirements of compliance best practice when compared with either manual accountability approaches or a leading privacy software solution. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accountability; Data Protection Officer; Register of Processing Activities; RegTech; Semantic Web",,"This work is partially supported by Uniphar PLC. and the ADAPT Centre for Digital Content Technology funded under the SFI Research Centres Programme (Grant 13/RC/2106_P2) and co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund.

The speed with which this technology is developing to undertake tasks that are not only complex and technical but also time-consuming and that are subject to constantly changing parameters is astounding. The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which machine learning can be used as a solution to lighten the compliance and regulatory burden on charitable organisations in the UK; so that they can comply with their regulatory duties and develop a coherent and streamlined action plan in relation to technological investment. Design/methodology/approach: The subject is approached through the analysis of data, literature and domestic and international regulation. The first part of the study summarises the extent of current regulatory obligations faced by charities, these are then, in the second part, set against the potential technological solutions provided by machine learning as of July 2021. Findings: It is suggested that charities can use machine learning as a smart technological solution to ease the regulatory burden they face in a growing and impactful sector. Originality/value: The work is original because it is the first to specifically explore how machine learning as a technological advance can assist charities in meeting the regulatory compliance challenge. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CharityTech; English law; Machine learning; RegTech; Unsupervised learning",,"The Commission is funded by the UK Government and like Companies House, undertakes the registration process and maintains the register and can also deregister (close down) a charity.

Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an important part of effectively preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the implementation of RegTech related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, especially in the Indonesian banking sector, has not been widely studied and discussed. Therefore, this study aims to provide empirical testing evidence regarding the effectiveness of RegTech implementation in the Indonesian banking sector to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data obtained through a survey distributed to 160 bankers who work in eight different banks in Indonesia with a 95% confidence level and a confidence interval of 7.75. The criteria needed to determine the sample in this study are individuals who actively work as staff whose work is directly related to banking; individuals who are actively working in banks registered with OJK; individuals who have been actively working in the banking sector in Indonesia for at least three years. The data that has been obtained were analyzed using the SmartPLS application to test the validity and reliability, descriptive statistics and structural models (inner model). Findings: The results of this study indicate that electronic know your customer (eKYC), transaction monitoring (TM), cost and time efficiencies (CTE) influence the prevention of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering financing of terrorism (CFT) in the Indonesian banking sector. However, eKYC and CTE have little influence on AML-CFT in the Indonesian banking sector. Meanwhile, TM has a moderate influence on AML-CFT in the Indonesian banking sector. In addition, in general, most bankers agree that the bank they work for has followed the guidelines, policies and regulations that have been given. Originality/value: This study uses the Indonesian banking sector as a research subject that raises the effectiveness of the implementation of the use of RegTech to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Banking; Banking money laundering terrorist financing; Money laundering; Regulatory technology (RegTech); Terrorist financing",,"Funding statement: This study is supported by BINUS University 2022 funding, as a part of Research Grant of Proyek Inisiatif BINUS (BINUS Initiative Project) entitled “Publikasi International Bereputasi, Hak Kekayaan Intelektual dan Multidisiplin Research Output dalam Integrated Catur Dharma Perguruan Tinggi” or “Reputable International Publication, Intellectual Property Rights and Multidisciplinary Research Output in Integrated Catur Dharma College”.",,"(2016) Study Guide CAMS Certification Exam, , Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS; Akter, S., D'Ambra, J., Ray, P., An evaluation of PLS based complex models: the roles of power analysis, predictive relevance and GoF index (2011) Proceedings of the 17th Americas Conference on Information systems (AMCIS2011), pp. 1-7. , Association for Information System, Detroit; Anagnostopoulos, I., Fintech and Regtech: impact on regulators and banks (2018) Journal of Economics and Business, 100 (1), pp. 7-25; Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures Indonesia (2018) Third Round Mutual Evaluation Report, , Sydney: APG; Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech and the reconceptualization of financial regulation (2016) Northwestern Journal of International Law and Business, 37, pp. 1-51; (2019) Blueprint Sistem Pembayaran Indonesia 2025 Bank Indonesia: Menavigasi Sistem Pembayaran Nasional di Era Digital, , Bank Indonesia; (2020) Anti pencucian uang dan pencegahan pendanaan terorisme, , www.bi.go.id/id/fungsi-utama/sistem-pembayaran/anti-pencucian-uang-dan-pencegahan-pendanaan-terrorisme/default.aspx, accessed 22 October 2021; (2020) Basel AML Index: 9th Public Edition Ranking Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risks around the World, , Basel Institute on Governance; Batunanggar, S., (2019) Fintech development and regulatory frameworks in Indonesia, , ADBI Working Paper Series, 1014, Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI, Tokyo; Butler, T., O'Brien, L., Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance (2019) Disrupting Finance, pp. 85-102. , Palgrave StudiesDigital Business and Enabling Technologies; Cohen, J., (1988) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Lawrence Erlabaum Associates, New York, NY; Cox, D., (2014) Handbook of Anti-Money Laundering, , John Wiley and Sons; Davis, K., Maddock, R., Foo, M., Catching up with Indonesia’s fintech industry (2017) Law and Financial Markets Review, 11 (1), pp. 1-8; Doane, D.P., Seward, L.E., Measuring skewness: a forgotten statistic?

Specifically, financial sector aims to efficiently supply distinct services using an infrastructure by relying on a centralised authority to manage and coordinate transactions at specific prices. In turn, final customers constantly seek to lower costs, quality, and reliability. Moreover, costumers desire less documentation and bureaucracy which hinder the access to financial services and credits. Financial system needs to create a digital strategy at the organisational level to address technology challenges and satisfy user’s needs. In this scenario, financial and technology domains have been integrated originating FinTech business models with significant impact. Therefore, this paper contributes not only with a technology background which allow to explore new FinTech-based business models but also describing existing business models employed in the market. Moreover, we present a comparison among traditional and FinTech-based models allowing to analyse the financial progress.

It is also one of the most researched topics during the current period. Banks and financial institutions nowadays are collecting large amounts of customer information which are imposed with AI and machine learning; however, the succeeding of all information remains unknown. This study attempts to identify the ethical issues in the application of Artificial intelligence and offers remedies from the Shariah principles. It also examines the role of Regulation technology (RegTech) in Islamic financial institutions. This study is exploratory in nature and used mainly primary data for the analysis purpose. The primary data is collected through the structured questionnaire obtained from the sharia scholars living in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The findings of the study suggest that the there is a significant relationship between ethical issues in AI implementation, role of RegTech and Islamic finance. The findings also suggest that the effective and intelligent utilization of RegTech and Islamic finance tools can reduce the ethical concern related to the AI implementation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Ethical issues; Ethics; Islamic finance",,,,"Qadir, J., Suleman, M., Teaching ethics, (Islamic) values and technology: Musings on course design and experience (2018) 2018 7Th International Conference on Computer and Communication Engineering (ICCCE), pp. 486-491. , pp., IEEE, September; Rabbani, M.R., The competitive structure and strategic positioning of commercial banks in Saudi Arabia (2020) Int.
