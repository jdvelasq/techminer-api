Democratic governments were intricately involved in the design of the leading permissioned blockchain-based digital development initiative in the Baltics. The Estonian e-Governance project initially arose in a local cyber-security community that sought to respond to the 2007 Russian cyber-attacks (Schmidt 2013a, b: 14; Hansel 2018). Over the following decade a network of citizens, governmental representatives, and firms was formed to expand this project. The technology companies involved were largely locally based or locally initiated start-ups. Building on the ‘hash-linked time-stamping’ technology developed by local cryptographers, a team of Estonian software and security specialists designed the digital signature system that underpins the Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) Blockchain Technology Stack. Produced by Estonian software security start-up Guardtime,21 the KSI Technology Stack is the permissioned blockchain underpinning a variety of Estonian state registries, including Healthcare Registry, Property Registry, Business Registry, Digital Court System, and others (Rodima-Taylor and Grimes 2019b).",,,,,,,,,,"Campbell-Verduyn, M.; Department of International Relations and International Organization (IRIO), Oude Kijk in ‘t Jatstraat 26, Netherlands; email: m.a.campbell-verduyn@rug.nl","Palgrave Macmillan",14086980,,,,"English","J.
