Government contracts to acquire huge volumes of Covid-19-related medical products, according to FATF-Style Regional Bodies (FSRB) members, contribute to the potential for corruption and theft of public funds. If there is less financial monitoring on government procurement and expenditure, this conduct may become more common.

However, considering the availability of regional data, it is difficult to divide the financial support for financial technology according to the main source, and the data of internal R&D funds of high-tech enterprises can reflect the investment level of financial technology to a certain extent.
