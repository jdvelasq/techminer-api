This study combines these two research streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital entrepreneurship, technology, and banking. The study first uses prior literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria in funding. Except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in different markets, and—as with most digital business models—scalability was identified as a key criterion. Additionally, by serving as a major provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs. Through developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders in fintechs and, hence, equity investors. We also describe how these formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements, digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration.",,,,,,,,,,"Bican, P.M.; Technology Management, Germany; email: peter.bican@fau.de","MDPI",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092890447

It insures a portion of loans made to qualifying small businesses by the private sector. It supports some 10,000 financings valued at around CAD1 billion each year. Under the CSBF Program, Industry Canada and commercial lenders share the risk of providing small businesses with term loans of up to CAD500,000 for acquiring real property and equipment and making leasehold improvements. The government is liable to pay 85% of eligible losses on defaulted loans registered under the program, which allows private-sector lenders to comfortably increase the amount of financing extended to small businesses. The program is supported by charging 3% above prime and a 2% registration fee paid by the borrowers. A lot of research has been done to evaluate the efficiency of different programs, including CSBF. Much of it shows the significant economic impact of these programs.19","Other notable programs include the Futurpreneur Canada (former Canada Youth Business Foundation—a charitable organization heavily supported by the government), Export Development Corporation (EDC), Aboriginal Business Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. Futurpreneur Canada helps young entrepreneurs by providing mentorship, learning resources and start-up financing when commercial lending is unavailable. It offers several different financing programs to support entrepreneurs aged 18 to 34, including one that provides start-up small business loans of up to CAD15,000. Founded in 1996, this program has invested in more than 3300 young people, whose businesses have generated more than 16,600 new Canadian jobs, CAD93 million in tax revenue and hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and export revenue. Export Development Corporation (EDC) supports large and small businesses with critical export financing; of its 8300 clients, about 80% are SMEs. Although EDC does not offer any grants, they do offer loan guarantees for companies exporting their products. If a company expects to export products and wants to minimize its risk, EDC is a great resource. Aboriginal Business Canada offers grants of up to CAD99,999 for eligible individual Aboriginal entrepreneurs. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada has made progress in increasing the participation of Aboriginal entrepreneurs in the Canadian economy through the Aboriginal Business Development Fund21.",,,,,,,,,"Miglo, A.; Department of Accounting, United Kingdom; email: anton.miglo@bcu.ac.uk","MDPI",20763387,,,,"English","Adm.

Subordinate control is performed by the main commodity manager (administrator) of budgetary funds to comply with the conditions, goals, and procedures established when providing budgetary allocations to autonomous institutions for the provision of state (municipal) services in the form of a subsidy for financial support for the fulfillment of state (municipal) assignment. b) Departmental control in the field of procurement under the Federal Law No. 223-FZ of July 18, 2011 ""On Procurement of Goods, Works, and Services by Certain Types of Legal Entities"". Furthermore, the internal control of economic activity implemented by founders and autonomous institutions aims at ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the economic entity, reliability and timeliness of accounting (financial) statements, as well as compliance with the legislation of the Russian Federation. Consequently, the main managers (administrators) of budget funds have a significant share of control powers in relation to the internal organization of financial and economic activities of economic entities. This involves subordinate control over the activities of subordinate institutions (Figure 1).","Summing up the characteristics of the key elements of various forms of control implemented by the main managers (administrators) of budget funds who are the founders, let us note that one of the goals of internal financial control is to ensure the efficient execution of the budget for expenses. This goal cannot be fully achieved without monitoring the financial and economic activities of autonomous institutions, the financial support of which to a large extent depends on budgetary funds provided by the founder. This statement is justified by the fact that the subsidy for financial support for the fulfillment of the state (municipal) assignment, the subsidy for other purposes, the subsidy to make capital investments, and grants in the form of subsidies are provided to autonomous institutions within the limits of budgetary obligations communicated to the founder as the recipient of budgetary funds under expenditures classification codes of budgets of the Russian Federation (Akhmadeev, 2019). Therefore, control over the use of budget funds by subordinate institutions acting as intermediaries between the main managers of budget funds and the final recipients of services is an integral element of the effective fulfillment of expenditure obligations of the Russian Federation, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation or a municipality. At the same time, departmental control is aimed at ensuring compliance by subordinate autonomous institutions with the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of procurement. It is fair to say that procurement is one use of budget allocations provided to autonomous institutions by the main managers of budget funds. Consequently, the authority of departmental control in the procurement sphere is partly included in the authority of internal financial control when implementing control over the level of jurisdiction. The financial and economic activities of subordinate institutions are not included in the list of objects of internal financial audit, which is a risk zone in terms of the efficient use of budget funds. Summarizing the above, the question of determining the importance of subordinate and departmental control in the existing system of financial control over the activities of autonomous institutions becomes obvious. It is necessary to increase the efficiency of internal financial control, internal financial audit, subordinate and departmental control. This can be achieved through modernizing the system of supervisory powers of the main budgetary funds' managers through the introduction of subordinate and departmental control as part of internal financial control (Polyakova, 2018).",,,,,,,,,,"Advanced Scientific Research",09752366,,,,"English","Int.

These are usually the ‘first movers’ and they are strongly financed by established financial markets and supported by advanced technology-platforms for scaling. For smaller markets, the small and medium-sized companies potentially face the future scaling and funding problem. Such companies may already be partially successful in their respective markets but further expansion financing for growth and internationalisation can come across the ‘bottleneck’ consequence. Much of the decline in the number of ‘smaller’ companies becoming listed is attributed to the very difficulty of being a small public company; this is reflected in the actions of venture capitalists, who once sought public listings when they wanted to exit their investments and now overwhelmingly choose private sales (Ritter, Economist, 2018 ). There is thus the real potential that firms are going to seek strategic alliances with incumbent financial institutions within the sector as their survival strategy. The risk for promising fintech/start-up companies is that there is also the potential to be constricted under the pressure of having to meet invariable demands in the services and products they offer. As such the issue becomes one of scale and capacity against larger firms, possibly the incumbents or indeed technology giants (i.e. Amazon, Apple etc.). This is important as at this stage. This is an industry with no ‘made’, crisis-resistant, proven businesses thus far. We do not know yet whether start-ups are mentally prepared for ‘exchanges’ in order to finance growth. In an industry under exponential development, pure cash exits do not exist as well for venture capital nor do acquisition evaluation models of a ‘made’ fintech business exist. Established institutions have the scale to absorb this which potentially gives rise to growth through a mergers and acquisitions wave. A pragmatic way for mergers to go through at this point is via exchanges of shares. The dangers in such a scenario are the ‘old-new firms’ where they ‘grow-and-consume’ entrants.",,,,,,,,,,,"Elsevier Inc.",01486195,,JEBUD,,"English","J. Econ.
