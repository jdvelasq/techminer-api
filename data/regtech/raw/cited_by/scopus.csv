A new decision-making model was created using multiple stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis and elimination and choice translating reality techniques based on quantum spherical fuzzy sets. First, in this model, the criteria for distributed energy investment necessities were weighted. Second, we ranked the components of the fintech ecosystem for distributed energy investments. The main contribution of this study is that appropriate strategies can be presented to design effective fintech ecosystems to increase distributed energy investments, by considering an original fuzzy decision-making model. Capacity is the most critical issue with respect to distributed energy investment necessities because it has the greatest weight (0.261). Pricing is another significant factor for this condition, with a weight of 0.254. Results of the ranking of the components of the fintech ecosystem indicate that end users are of the greatest importance for the effectiveness of this system. It is necessary to develop new techniques for the energy storage process, especially with technological developments, to prevent disruptions in energy production capacity. In addition, customers’ expectations should be considered for the development of effective and user-friendly financial products that are preferred by a wider audience. This would have a positive effect on fintech ecosystem performance. © 2023, The Author(s).","Distributed energy investments; ELECTRE; Fintech ecosystems; Innovative financial products; Multi SWARA",,"Ai, R.; Bank of China Chengdu High-Tech Industrial Development Zone Sub-BranchChina; email: airuichinabank@sina.com

Design/methodology/approach: This work combines data analytics of text mining with qualitative analysis of human intelligence in two steps. First, knowledge discovery of the Islamic fintech ecosystem’s core elements using a sample of eight academic articles totalling 102 pages and 75,082 words. Second, using the identified core elements from step one to explore such ecosystem development in Indonesia. This stage employs a sample of 11 documents totalling 371 pages and 143,032 words from cyberspace. Findings: The core elements of the Islamic fintech ecosystem identified are financial customers, fintech startups, government, technology developers, traditional financial institutions and fatwa (Islamic legal opinion). Furthermore, the development of the Islamic fintech ecosystem in Indonesia is examined under these identified core elements, providing critical insights into the Islamic fintech ecosystem currently established in the country's industry. Research limitations/implications: This study primarily used semi-structured data from cyberspace. Traditional approaches to qualitative data collection, e.g. focused group discussions and interviews, may be beneficial for future studies in addressing the Islamic fintech ecosystem issues. Practical implications: Academia worldwide may benefit from this work in incorporating knowledge of Islamic fintech ecosystem’s core elements into Islamic finance literature. Specifically, fintech stakeholders in Indonesia may be advantaged to understand how far the Islamic fintech ecosystem has grown in the country. Social implications: The rise of unethical fintech peer-to-peer lending shows social problems in Indonesia’s fintech industry. The finding derives social implications that elucidate the current state of the country’s Islamic fintech ecosystem.

Credit corruption is a worldwide problem; however, previous studies have not focused on the anti-corruption effect of FinTech. This study first uses micro data from FinTech companies to construct city-level FinTech measurement indicators in China. An objective measurement of credit corruption is then formed by separating the expenditures for credit corruption from total business entertainment expenses. This study empirically explores the impact of FinTech on credit corruption using a sample of Chinese listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2011 to 2019. The results show that FinTech can significantly curb credit corruption, and that the expenditures for credit corruption of local companies are lower with better regional FinTech. These findings are valid after addressing endogeneity issues and conducting a series of robustness tests. The results of the heterogeneity test show that FinTech offers greater advantages for risk identification, information mining, and inclusive development than traditional finance. The curbing effect on credit corruption is stronger in companies with better intrinsic quality, more transparent information disclosure, located in less financially developed and more corrupt regions. Economic consequence analysis suggests that FinTech can correct resource misallocation caused by credit corruption and promote corporate investment efficiency. These findings are valuable for policy practices for technological anti-corruption in the financial sector. © 2022 The Author(s)","Credit corruption; Digital and intelligent transformation in banks; FinTech; Technological anti-corruption",,"Su, F.; School of Finance, Hubei, China; email: sufan_hbue@163.com",25307614,,,"J.

Unknown are, however, the primary factors of public support for the initiative and CBDC acceptance choices. Moreover, despite the fact that CBDC's success requires substantial public support, there is less empirical data of how the public perceives and speaks about it. This research seeks to fill in these gaps using Facebook data from May 2012 to April 2022 using deep learning algorithms for text mining. This research demonstrates that government performance, inflation rate, economic inequality, and technological literacy have a significant influence on the public's perception of CBDC. The government's support of CBDC is determined by public sentiment, the degree of adoption of decentralized finance (Defi), and monetary policy settings. The degree of wealth inequality and technological literacy are two other demographic elements that influence the government's adoption of CBDC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Central bank digital currency; Financial market conditions; Governmental factors; Monetary policy; Public sentiment; Text mining",,"Ngo, V.M.; University of Economic Ho Chi Minh City, 59C Nguyen Dinh Chieu street, Ward 6, District 3, Viet Nam; email: vunm@ueh.edu.vn",02755319,,,"Res.

To remedy this, we develop a novel regulatory scoring framework to quantify and compare the corresponding regulatory capital charge errors of credit scoring models. As an application of RegTech, the proposed framework considers the characteristic of example-dependence and cost-sensitivity in credit scoring, which is expected to enhance the ability of risk absorption of financial institutions and thus benefit the regulators. Validated on two real-world credit datasets, empirical results reveal that credit scoring models with good predictive accuracy or profitability do not necessarily provide low capital charge requirement error, which further highlights the importance of regulatory scoring framework. The family of gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) provides significantly better average performance than industry benchmarks and deep multilayer percep-tron network, especially when financial stability is the primary focus. To further examine the robustness of the proposed regulatory scoring, sampling techniques, cut-off value modification, and probability calibration are employed within the framework and the main conclusions hold in most cases. Furthermore, the analysis on the interpretability via TreeSHAP algorithm alleviates the concerns on transparency of GBDT-based models, and confirms the important roles of loan characteristics, borrowers’ solvency and creditworthiness as powerful predictors in credit scoring.

In this paper, we have systematically researched and reviewed the literature on medical crowdfunding to determine how crowdfunding connects with the health care industry. The health care industry has been struggling to develop sustainable research and business models for economic systems and investors alike, especially in pharmaceuticals. The research results have revealed a wealth of evidence concerning the way crowdfunding is applied in real life. Patients and caregivers utilize web platform–based campaigns all over the world to fund their medical expenses, generally on a spot basis, using donation-based or even reward-based schemes, regardless of the health care system archetype (public, private insurance-based or hybrid). Academics have also focused on funding campaigns and the predictors of success (which range from social behaviour and environment to the basic demographics of the campaigners and their diseases) and on social and regulatory concerns, including heightened social inequality and stigma. While equity crowdfunding is disrupting the way many ventures/businesses seek capital in the market, our research indicates that there are no relevant or consistent data on the practice of medical equity crowdfunding in health care, apart from a few anecdotal cases. © 2022, The Author(s).","Crowdfunding; Fintech; Health crowdfunding; Healthtech; Medtech; Pharma; R&D funding",,"Grassi, L.; School of Management, Italy; email: laura.grassi@polimi.it",21994730,,,"Financial Innov.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

We also show that the emergence of fintech in the area of financial regulation (regulatory technology: regtech) can significantly improve financial development outcomes.

To this purpose, in the context of a pharma manufacturing environment, a data integrity ontology (DIOnt) is proposed to be utilized as the basis for the semantic representation of pharma production data and the associated regulatory compliance management processes. We further show that semantic annotations can be used to represent the required ALCOA compliance information, and that semantic reasoning combined with SQWRL queries can be used to evaluate ALCOA compliance. The proposed approach has been implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype and validated with real world pharma manufacturing data, supporting the combined execution of SWRL rules and SQWRL queries with the aim to support the ALCOA compliance assessment and calculate non-compliance percentages per each ALCOA principle. © 2022 by the authors.","ALCOA; data integrity; ontology technology; pharmaceutical industry; regulatory compliance; SQWRL; SWRL",,"Lallas, E.N.; School of Technology, Greece; email: elallas@uth.gr",20763417,,,"Appl.

Financial services called FinTech are one such example of the adoption of cutting-edge technologies. On the other hand, with the adoption of technologies comes to the cybersecurity risks associated with them. Data leakage is one big issue in FinTech and business-related applications and services. The main aim of this chapter is to identify different ways and methods by which data leakage occurs and its adverse effects on organizations providing FinTech services. Furthermore, this chapter explores the various solutions and challenges in their implementation. It is concluded that no single solution can handle data leakage from all perspectives. Multiple solutions need to be combined and utilized to handle all scenarios. © 2023, IGI Global.",,,"Chaudhry, U.H.; Department of Computing, Pakistan",,9781668452868; 9781668452844,,"Handb. of Res. on Cybersecur.

On one hand, modernization in technology has facilitated the daily operation of banks; on the other hand, this has also resulted in an increase in the number of cyber-attacks. Artificial Intelligence has introduced new models to detect and prevent cybercrimes. Some fraud has also occurred due to the involvement of employees inside particular organizations. So, this study has focused on both sides: the machine as well as the human. Firstly, the research has focused on fraud diamond theory and has analyzed factors such as rationalization, capabilities, perceived pressure, and perceived opportunities to understand the psychology of the fraudster. Secondly, Artificial Intelligence characteristics, threat exposure, big data management, explainability, cost effectiveness, and risk prediction are evaluated to explore their use in fraud reduction in banks. The research data have been collected from 15 Banks in Pakistan with the help of a questionnaire using five-item Likert scales. The data have been analyzed using IBM SPSS Software. The results gained after correlation and regression analysis proved that Fraud diamond theory and AI characteristics have positive and significant effects on cybercrimes. This study is a great contribution to the banking industry of Pakistan as it provides a complete analysis to control fraud inside organizations by understanding the mindset of fraudsters with the help of fraud diamond theory. At the same time, outside fraud will be handled with the help of Artificial Intelligence. This will result in banks growth, which ultimately boosts the economy of a country.

Under a new national policy, Saudi Arabia intends to increase the number of FinTech firms. Thus, it is necessary to develop a more profound understanding of what critically enables FinTech innovation, how these enablers are interconnected, and their priorities. This research study aims to identify and model the critical enablers of FinTech innovation by exploring contextual relationships among them and their importance. A hybrid approach was followed using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and an analytic network process (ANP) to achieve the objective. Eleven enablers and their essential components were extracted from the literature and confirmed by Saudi FinTech experts who provided input data on their linkages and relative importance through interviews and a designed questionnaire. The developed model reveals the enablers’ structure in terms of their driving and dependence powers and classifies them into six levels with relative importance to each other. The developed model in this research puts forward a holistic perspective on FinTech and innovation, assisting decision-makers, regulators, policy designers, practitioners, and technology developers to create effective ways to safeguard the FinTech industry’s growth. © 2022 by the authors.","ANP; enablers; FinTech; hybrid; innovation; ISM; modeling; Saudi Arabia",,"Makki, A.A.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Saudi Arabia; email: nhmakki@kau.edu.sa",20798954,,,"Systems",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

Today, it is regulated in several most relevant banking jurisdictions. Despite its growing relevance, consensus about the definition of open banking is lacking. This study examines 282 articles on open banking using bibliometric clustering techniques. Moreover, within the 282 articles and applying discourse analysis, we analyze 47 idiosyncratic definitions of open banking to test an integral framework that supports our proposed definition of the concept. Our study contributes to the literature by providing a generalized multidisciplinary definition of open banking. It identifies four main drivers behind the concept: business model change, client data sharing, incorporation of technological companies (fintechs and others), and regulation. These four elements, which should be considered in new regulations in the globalized banking sector, foresee open banking as a critical enabler of a new strategic dynamic in banking. © 2022 Briones de Araluze, Cassinello Plaza.

Turkey is one of the largest emerging market economies in the world with a strong banking system and high adoption of technology, so it has great potential to benefit from fintech solutions to boost sustainable finance. For the case analysis, the data used came from a research platform for a Turkish start-up ecosystem, Turkish regulations, and documents released on Turkey’s sustainable finance strategies by Turkish and international institutions. We found that Turkey has made remarkable progress in increasing financial inclusivity for underbanked individuals and SMEs via providing contactless payment and contract systems and microfinance by mobile carriers and other online platforms. Turkey was also able to promote the responsible consumption goal for sustainable development by improving fintech solutions on payment systems with educational content on this goal. With upcoming developments such as the sandbox environment in Istanbul Financial Center, fintech solutions using Big Data, AI, and blockchain could emerge much faster with collaboration between banking and fintech sectors and regulatory institutions to better assess climate-related financial risks and form a national carbon trading mechanism. © 2022 by the authors.","emerging economies; fintech; sustainable finance; Turkey","banking; emissions trading; financial system; market system; microfinance; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Istanbul; Turkey","Talay, I.; Trinity Business School, Luce Hall, Pearse St, Ireland; email: talayi@tcd.ie",20711050,,,"Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

However, lack of regulation will also have a huge impact on economic and social development. In this paper, an evolutionary game model of digital finance innovation is constructed, the evolutionary strategies of both sides of the game are discussed, and a simulation analysis is carried out, based on the dynamic reward and punishment mechanism of the government. The results show that the system can achieve evolutionary stability under the dynamic reward and punishment mechanism, and that the evolutionarily stable strategy is unique. We also find that when the punishment of regulators increases, the probability of compliance innovation of digital financial enterprises will increase, and the probability of active supervision of regulatory agencies will decrease. When regulators increase incentives, the probability of the compliance innovation of digital financial enterprises will decrease. Similarly, the probability of active supervision by regulators will also decrease and the decrease will be more obvious. To achieve the win-win development of digital financial innovation and regulation, it is necessary to continuously improve the regulatory capacity and level, reduce regulatory costs, and build a dynamic reward and punishment mechanism.

This paper documents the real effects of RegTech in the market of corporate control. Exploiting the staggered implementation of the EDGAR system from 1993 to 1996 as quasi-exogenous RegTech shocks, we find that RegTech developments reduce firm acquisitiveness, especially for growth firms, solo-bidder deals, and stock-based acquisitions. Our main findings still hold when employing the stack-cohort approach to address concerns regarding biased staggered DiD estimators. In addition, EDGAR implementation discourages informed trading and lowers the acquirers' announcement returns. Overall, our deal-level analyses show how RegTech development matters for firm investment decisions with more granularities. Our paper differs from but complements recent empirical evidence that EDGAR implementation increases the level of overall investment, suggesting that dampened managerial learning induces firms to switch from highly risky and uncertain projects (M&As) to routine projects with less uncertainty (capital expenditures). © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","EDGAR; Firm acquisitiveness; Mergers and acquisitions (M&As); Price efficiency; Regulation technology (RegTech)",,"Li, D.; Department of Finance, Fujian, China; email: lidongxu@xmu.edu.cn",09291199,,,"J.

Emerging blockchain technology can help improve credit-reporting ability through greater integrity, decentralization, transparency, security, and reliability. Aiming to address the problem of extensive credit investigation data and privacy protection, we propose a blockchain-based model to realize access control and management of the shared transaction information in the supply chain. Our model adopts a consensus mechanism to solve the problem of large credit investigation data and privacy protection of credit investigation data and realizes access control and management of the shared data chain. In our model, data are stored on the cloud server and shared with the proxy reencryption method. The model's data structure and workflow are designed to facilitate specific applications in supply chain finance. The embedded blockchain technology helps build the open shared reference architecture and establish the entire life cycle of a monitoring mechanism. The existing blockchain consensus mechanism has low security and a large resource consumption; as such, it is particularly important to design a new consensus mechanism to serve the credit investigation system. In this study, blockchain data sharing and traceability can be realized by improving the consensus mechanism, helping to improve the existing credit investigation service system.

One of these changes is the emergence of financial technology (FinTech) companies that are radically transforming the industry, posing a significant challenge to traditional commercial banks. In this study, we examined the responses of the Hungarian banks to the emergence of innovative FinTech startups and explored the benefits and barriers of the FinTech accelerator programs launched by banks. We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with top executives of banks, FinTech startups and scaleups, investors and regulators to identify the potential benefits and barriers during the cooperation between banks and FinTechs. The most important results of our research show that during the partnership, several advantages can be gained by both parties. Still, the realization of these benefits is significantly hindered by the excessive exploitation focus of banks.

Executives attempt to influence employees toward achieving business goals, and they attempt to prevent and detect wrongdoing, misconduct, and crime among employees. However, top-down approaches to corporate control do not work when executives and other privileged individuals in the business themselves commit and conceal their wrongdoing, misconduct, and crime in organizational settings. Then there is a need for a bottom-up approach in corporate control as outlined in this book. Bottom-up control refers to the manner in which organizational members can use different types of control mechanisms - such as whistleblowing, transparency, resource access, or culture - to monitor, measure, and evaluate executives' avoidance of deviant behaviors and influence them toward achieving the organization's goals in efficient and effective ways. The newly emerging perspective of a social license to operate forms part of the bottom-up strategy where criminalization becomes social property independent of the criminal justice system. The social license is predominantly centered on social permission for business activity where the media, social movements, and citizen watchdogs exert pressure, demand change, and bring top management to account. This book presents a novel approach to corporate control of white-collar crime based on the theory of convenience. White-collar crime is financial crime committed by privileged individuals who have legitimate access to resources based on the power and trust inherent through their professional positions. Convenience theory proposes that motive, opportunity, and willingness are the three dimensions that underlie white-collar crime in an organizational context. This book contributes to the study of white-collar criminality through a blend of theoretical discussions and practical materials that illuminate and support the use of convenience theory. The book discusses how bottom-up approaches can overcome the difficulty of detecting white-collar crime and overcome the barriers of preventing executive deviance. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

The authors reiterate the potential of digital disruption to shrink the role and relevance of today's banks, while simultaneously creating better, faster, cheaper services that will be an essential part of everyday life. Digital transformation will also offer the ability to create new ways to better comply to Islamic values in order to rebuild trust and confidence in the current financial system. In this new edition, they explore current concepts of decentralized finance (DeFi), distributed intelligence, stablecoins, and the integration of AI, blockchain, data analytics and IoT devices for a holistic solution to ensure technology adoption in a prudent and sustainable manner. The book discusses crucial innovation, structural and institutional developments for financial technologies including two fast-growing trends that merge and complement each other: tokenization, where all illiquid assets in the world, from private equity to real estate and luxury goods, become liquid and can be traded more efficiently, and second, the rise of a new tokenized economy where inevitably new rules and ways to enforce them will develop to fully unleash their capabilities. These complementary and oft-correlated trends will complete the decentralization of finance and will influence the way future financial services will be implemented. This book provides insights into the shift in processes, as well as the challenges that need to be overcome for practical applications for AI and blockchain and how to approach such innovations. It also covers new technological risks that are the consequence of utilizing frontier technologies such as AI, blockchain and IoT. Industry leaders, Islamic finance professionals, along with students and academics in the fields of Islamic finance and economics will benefit immensely from this book.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial area and Fintech services allied to technology has increased efficiency, convenience, and security. To better understand this type of service, the research follows a quantitative methodology. The quantitative method included a questionnaire survey of companies that are Fintech customers, totaling 49 valid responses from firms (collected over a three-month period and which involved sending over a thousand emails to numerous companies). The response rate was low due to both the pandemic and the conjuncture with major war, which are generating uncertainty in business. The analysis was based on descriptive statistics, an assessment of the metric qualities of the scales, reliability and an Exploratory Factor Analysis, Pearson correlations and Hypothesis testing. The positive and significant effect of the technological context (perceived convenience, usefulness and effectiveness and perceived safety and trust) and the organizational context (ecological footprint reduction and internal cost reduction) on Fintech service adoption intention was confirmed. Hypothesis Three was partially confirmed since only consumer trends and reputation perception have a positive and significant effect on the intention to adopt Fintech by SMEs. The moderating effect of the environmental context in the relationship between the technological context and the intention to adopt Fintech by SMEs was partially proven, but the same was not verified in the relationship between the organizational context and the intention to adopt Fintech by SMEs. Portugal seems to be on the same adoption path as the rest of the western world, and Fintech services will undoubtedly increase, in a kind of revolution in which the strongest and those able to adapt to the markets and their needs will survive. © 2022 by the authors.","COVID-19; digital finance; digital innovation; disruptive innovation; e-commerce; finance; Fintech; Fintech ecosystem; SaaS","Cost reduction; Ecology; Factor analysis; Quality control; Reliability analysis; Surveys; Digital finance; Digital innovations; Disruptive innovations; E- commerces; Financial sectors; Fintech ecosystem; In-depth analysis; Organizational context; Saa; Small-and-medium enterprise; COVID-19","Palma-Moreira, A.; School of Psychology, Rua do Jardim do Tabaco 34, Portugal; email: amoreira@ispa.pt",20782489,,,"Information",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

This work builds on a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis of the literature on RegTech, its influential papers and authors, its main areas of research, its past and its future. The resulting multi-dimensional framework bridges across four main dimensions, starting with regulation and technology, where one or more regulations, not necessarily financial ones, are addressed with the support of technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, DLT, blockchain, smart contracts, API). Data play a central role, as sharing them enables data ecosystems, where additional value can be attained by each market participant, while data automation and machine-readable regulations empower regulators to pull data directly from the banks’ systems and combine these data with data obtained directly from customers or other external sources. Several applications emerge, both for regulated entities, covering matters of compliance, monitoring, risk management, reporting and operations, as well as for authorities, which can leverage on RegTech (SupTech) solutions to make policies, to undertake their authorising, supervising and enforcement operations, for monitoring and controlling purposes, and even to issue fines automatically. As a consequence, stakeholders can reap a series of benefits, such as higher efficiency and effectiveness, accuracy, transparency and lower compliance costs but also risks, such as cyber risk, algorithmic biases, and dehumanization. © 2022, The Author(s).","Compliance; Data; Digital innovation; FinTech; Insurtech; Monitoring; RegTech; Regulation; Regulatory technology; Reporting; Risk management; SupTech",,"Grassi, L.; Department of Management Engineering, Italy; email: laura.grassi@polimi.it",03912078,,,"J.

The Chinese economy is no exception in its attempts to conserve economic and natural resources via collaborative efforts to embrace cleaner technology, green energy sources, and resource conservation management to preserve resources for future generations. This research examines the influence of cleaner technolo-gies, green energy sources, and natural resource management on reducing greenhouse gas emissions using quarterly data for the Chinese economy from 2000Q1 to 2020Q4. The findings demonstrate that increasing demand for green energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions, hence substantiating the premise of ‘green is clean’ energy development. Additionally, optimum resource usage enhances environmental quality, corroborating the ‘resource cleaner blessing’ hypothesis. The positive link between inward foreign direct investment and greenhouse gas emissions substantiates the ‘pollution haven’ concept, according to which inward foreign direct investment uses unsustainable technology in manufacturing processes, hence degrading air quality indicators. Inadequate access to clean cooking technology and increased population density has a detrimental effect on the country’s environmental sustainability agenda, which must be corrected via sustainable regulations. The causality estimates show the feedback relationship between renewable energy demand (and economic growth) and cleaner technology, between economic growth and green energy (and inbound foreign direct investment), and between population density and economic growth (and green energy). The Impulse Response function estimates suggested that economic growth and population density would likely increase GHG emissions. In contrast, cleaner technology, green energy demand, natural resource management, and inbound foreign direct investment would likely decrease greenhouse gas emissions for the next ten-year time period. The sustainability of the environment and natural resources in China is bolstered by developing cleaner technologies, a greater reliance on renewable energy sources, and better management of natural resources. © 2022 by the authors.

ResTech is the application of technologies: i) to support the work of resolution authorities in developing resolution plans and in resolving financial firms; and ii) to allow financial firms to achieve regulatory compliance and better risk management in a more effective and automated manner. This paper also argues that the features and market dynamics of resolution differ from those of RegTech and SupTech: there is little market incentive for the private sector to foster innovation in the area of crisis resolution. The lack of private sector incentives to invest in R&D on how to resolve a firm’s crisis leaves the task to resolution authorities. In addition, resolution-technologies may support the identification of optimal liquidation strategy for small and medium-sized financial firms, by ensuring the maximisation of creditors’ proceeds out of the insolvency estate. © 2021, The Author(s).","Bank resolution; Big data; Innovation; Machine learning; ResTech",,"Rulli, E.; Single Resolution BoardBelgium; email: edoardo.rulli@uniroma2.it",17456452,,,"J.

SMEs play a significant role in economic growth and development, particularly in developing countries. However, value promoting financial inclusion for SMEs through digitalization is still understudied. The objectives aimed at by this investigation were: to study the impact of financial inclusion on SME performances, to observe the influence of digital financing on financial inclusion and SME performance association as a mediator and to examine how the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) supports financial inclusion and SME performance. A well-structured questionnaire using a quantitative research approach was utilized to gather data from 366 owner-managers among Sri Lankan SMEs. The study’s findings are presented: financial inclusion, digital financing and TAM play influential roles in SME performance. More precisely, digital financing and TAM mediate positively the relationship between financial inclusion and performance in SMEs. The findings of this research endeavor to shed light on developing and popularizing digital financing by providing services which are cheap, secure and low risk from a supply-side perspective, as well as adopting and adjusting digital financing by enhancing financial literacy, which would be necessary from the demand-side perspective. © 2022 by the authors.","digital financing; financial inclusion; SME performance; Sri Lanka; TAM","Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Digital financing; Economic development; Economic downturn; Financial inclusions; High quality; Inclusive finances; Performance; SME performance; Sri Lanka; Technology acceptance model; Finance","Thathsarani, U.S.; School of Economics, China; email: thathsarani0@gmail.com",20782489,,,"Information",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus

We draw upon modularity theory and the literature on industry architecture to consider how strategic bottlenecks emerged and how value shifted between layers of the IVC. Furthermore, we examine the interplay between the agendas of the regulator and firm strategic responses to unpack how firms (product providers) responded by pursuing integrative innovation and less specialization to mitigate the effects of value migration to strategic bottlenecks.

In the banking industry, this approach allows banking institutions to provide improved customer experiences. However, the determinants of successful banking digitalization are still unclear, as are their cause-and-effect relationships. This article sought to apply problem structuring methods, namely, fuzzy cognitive mapping and system dynamics, to develop a conceptual model that can be applied to analyses of banking industry digitalization. The results are based on two group sessions that were held with a panel of decision makers who deal with banking digitalization processes on a daily basis. The findings were validated by a senior staff member responsible for banking project assessment and development at Caixa Geral de Depósitos S.A. - a Portuguese state-owned banking corporation. The approach adopted in this article is unique because digitalization determinants were collected and analyzed based on the participants' know-how and experience.

Financial technology involves software, applications, and other technologies designed to improve and automate traditional forms of financial services for businesses established in different areas. The authors aimed to explore the impact of financial technology on the digital literacy rate in India, by utilizing the poverty score as a moderating variable. The panel data analysis (PDA) has been employed in the current study. Data from 29 states and two union territories (UTs) of India were considered for three financial years, i.e., 2017–2018 to 2019–2020. The study’s findings reveal that Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs), both in terms of numbers and amount, are positively associated with the literacy rate. However, ATMs are negatively significant in association with literacy rate. Furthermore, the study’s empirical results show that KCCs and ATMs positively impact literacy when interacting with poverty scores. The study’s findings bring noteworthy implications for the government and other officials to understand the situation at the ground level of Indian states and UTs while forming new rules and policies for society’s betterment, particularly in finance and digital literacy. Additionally, the findings imply that ordinary people living in urban and rural areas of India should take advantage of financial technology and get motivated towards digital literacy. © 2022 by the authors.","ATMs; digital literacy; financial technology; Kisan credit cards",,"Bhimavarapu, V.M.; Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, India; email: mrudulabhimavarapu@gmail.com",19118074,,,"J.

Global adoption of fintech is rapidly increasing due to its disruptive nature and is largely embraced by participants who are underserved by traditional financial service providers. Global investments in fintech are growing rapidly year by year owing to increased interconnectivity with the digital revolution. Fintech is expansive, engulfing a plethora of innovative applications in various services including payments, financing, asset management, insurance, etc. There exists a gap in the literature and visualization research on impact and future pathway of fintech innovations in payments and financial services and role of financial regulations. This study aims to enrich the understanding of fintech innovations in payments and financing and investigate the correlation and significance of regulatory framework in maintaining a fair ecosystem. With this objective, an extant systematic review was performed using research articles published in peer-reviewed journals for the period 2014–2022 when there has been a burgeoning of interest in ‘fintech’ globally. The findings of this study contribute to the theoretical constructs of fintech innovations in the financial services industry and show that such innovations play a crucial role in shaping the nature of future of business.

This paper explores the impact and mechanism of a bank's FinTech innovation on its risk-taking using panel data of 65 commercial banks between 2008 and 2020. We innovatively construct a bank-level index based on web crawler technology and obtain the annual numbers of news items about a bank's FinTech innovation from each bank in Baidu News. The empirical results show that improvement in the bank's FinTech innovation significantly reduces its risk-taking. To overcome endogenous problems, including measurement errors and omitted variables, we use the instrumental variables (IV) and difference-in-differences (DID) methods to test the hypothesis and obtain consistent estimated results. The mechanism analysis shows that banks rely on FinTech innovation to reduce their risk-taking by improving their operating income and capital adequacy ratio, optimizing their operating performance, and improving their risk control capabilities. Further, a heterogeneity analysis shows that the effect of a bank's FinTech innovation in reducing its risk-taking is more pronounced in larger, state-owned, joint-stock, and highly-competitive commercial banks. Our research results still hold after a series of robustness tests, including changing the construction methods of the bank's FinTech innovation index, replacing the bank's risk-taking indicators, tail-shrinking treatment, and changing samples.

First, we build upon information diagnosticity theory to address the need for explainable classifications empowering regulators to justify their actions. Second, we consider a bag-of-words representation and ensemble learning to ensure high classification accuracy. Third, we take into account author characteristics to avoid discriminating classifications.

The potential applications and improvements that blockchain might bring to the financial industry are astounding. Specifically, this study discussed the importance and possible areas of deploying blockchain technology in the banking sector of an emerging country with a fast-growing economy, namely Jordan, for different reasons. First, due to the shrinking interest-rate spread, Jordan's financial sector lacks long-term lending and unsecured loans. Second, many economic revolutions, such as the internet and banking innovations, have impacted the Jordanian banking sector. As a result, the banking sector must undergo significant transformation to increase performance and attain new levels of growth. Third, the underlying technology in clearing payment and credit bank information systems could be revolutionized by blockchains. Fourth, blockchain applications facilitate ""obtain credit, unsecured loans"" scenarios, improving banking efficiency. Finally, while blockchain has much appeal because it allows free and self-governing transfers, overall regulation and security for this decentralized system are still being created and agreed upon. We argue that for blockchain to change Jordan's financial system, legal frameworks must be in place to control banking transactions. This study explores the technology of blockchain, the emerging technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It highlights the features of the blockchain and shows why it could profoundly influence the entire banking sector in areas ranging from payments to settlements and identity services. © 2022 Science Press.

Financial technology, formed by combining digital technology with traditional financial services, is gradually changing the financial service model and providing new ideas for corporate investment and financing. In this study, using the data of non-financial and non-real estate listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, A-shares from 2015 to 2020, we examine the effect of financial technology on corporate innovation through a fixed-effects model and investigate the influence of corporate characteristics on the relationship between financial technology and innovation through a moderating-effects model. The results show that financial technology enhances the ability to serve real enterprises by reshaping financial services, which in turn effectively drives an increase in corporate innovation, and the mechanism is conditionally heterogeneous. In addition, the moderating effect of the firm’s nature is found to be more significant in non-state-owned firms, high-technology firms, and firms in the growth and maturity stages by life cycle. The policy implications of this study are to continuously promote theoretical research, to guide the development of fintech, and to improve the construction of financial technology infrastructure. Additionally, to deepen the integration of financial technology with real enterprises and establish differentiated financial technology support tools, so as to improve the pre-cision of promoting enterprise innovation. © 2022 by the authors.

Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain. This study uses a design science research methodology, a text mining technique, and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the development trends concerning the presentation of the product or service information on a company's website. This study applies regulatory technology (RegTech) as a case to analyze and justify the emerging cross-disciplinary trend. Furthermore, an experimental study is conducted using the Google search engine to verify and validate the proposed research mechanism at the end of this study. The study results reveal that, compared with Google Trends and Google Correlate, the research mechanism proposed in this study is more illustrative, feasible, and promising because it reduces noise and avoids the additional time and effort required to perform a further in-depth exploration to obtain the information. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The ROPA must include information from heterogeneous sources such as (internal) departments with varying IT systems and (external) data processors. Current practices use spreadsheets or proprietary systems that lack machine-readability and interoperability, presenting barriers to automation. We propose the Data Processing Catalogue (DPCat) for the representation, collection and transfer of ROPA information, as catalogues in a machine-readable and interoperable manner. DPCat is based on the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) and its extension DCAT Application Profile for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP), and the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV). It represents a comprehensive semantic model developed from GDPR’s Article and an analysis of the 17 ROPA templates from EU Data Protection Authorities (DPA). To demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of DPCat, we present the European Data Protection Supervisor’s (EDPS) ROPA documents using DPCat, verify them with SHACL to ensure the correctness of information based on legal and contextual requirements, and produce reports and ROPA documents based on DPA templates using SPARQL. DPCat supports a data governance process for data processing compliance to harmonise inputs from heterogeneous sources to produce dynamic documentation that can accommodate differences in regulatory approaches across DPAs and ease investigative burdens toward efficient enforcement. © 2022 by the authors.

As a new technology and innovative method that competes with, and also supplements, traditional financial methods, fintech has had a significant impact on traditional financial businesses and has thus challenged the role of commercial banks as credit intermediaries in the financial sector. This paper examines the potential risks that fintech brings to commercial banks in China, and collects data from 19 systemically important banks from 2011–2020 to analyze the effect of fintech development on commercial banks’ financial risks in order to achieve sustainable development in the financial sector. Using the Z value and non-performing loan ratio as the criterion variables, this study shows that the impact of fintech on the financial risks of systemically important banks demonstrates an inverted U-shaped pattern, with the financial risk increasing first and then decreasing alongside the further development of fintech. The results also show that commercial banks’ responses to fintech development has been comparatively slow. Managerial suggestions are then discussed on risk supervision for commercial banks and the financial sector in China and other emerging markets. © 2022 by the authors.

Its openness, interoperability, and other characteristics trigger the concealment, infectivity, universality and sudden characteristics of financial risk more obviously, and the potential systemic risk more complexly. This paper adopts fuzzy set analysis to conduct a comprehensive review of Fintech risk. It is found that the technology risk, moral hazard and legal risk, with a weight of up to 80%, are the dominant factors affecting the Fintech risk, while other prominent credit risk, market risk and operational risk in the traditional financial field account for a small proportion, but they still cannot be ignored. The research of this paper enriches the relevant research on the quantification of Fintech risk, and helps to strengthen risk prevention from the aspect of enhancing the safety of Fintech infrastructure, improving the legal system, sound the regulatory framework and strengthening industry self-discipline. © 2022 by the authors.

To establish its effectiveness in meeting this obligation, we evaluate an ROPA semantic model, the Common Semantic Model–ROPA (CSM–ROPA). Semantic models and tools represent one solution to the compliance challenges faced by organisations: the heterogeneity of relevant data sources, and the lack of tool interoperability and agreed common standards. By surveying current practice and the literature we identify the requirements for GDPR accountability tools: digital exchange of data, automated accountability verification and privacy-aware data governance. A case study was conducted to analyse the expressivity and effectiveness of CSM–ROPA when used as an interoperable, machine-readable mediation layer to express the concepts in a comprehensive regulator-provided accountability framework used for GDPR compliance. We demonstrate that CSM–ROPA can express 98% of ROPA accountability terms and fully express nine of the ten European regulators' ROPA templates. We identify three terms for addition to CSM–ROPA, and we identify areas where CSM–ROPA relies on partial matches that indicate model limitations. These improvements to CSM–ROPA will provide comprehensive coverage of the regulator-supplied model. We show that tools based on CSM–ROPA can fully meet the requirements of compliance best practice when compared with either manual accountability approaches or a leading privacy software solution. © 2022, The Author(s).","Accountability; Data Protection Officer; Register of Processing Activities; RegTech; Semantic Web",,"Ryan, P.; ADAPT Centre, Glasnevin, Ireland; email: paul.ryan76@mail.dcu.ie",2662995X,,,"SN COMPUT.

It extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by integrating perceived risk, initial trust and financial literacy into an overarching conceptual model. Design/methodology/approach: Measurement items of the theoretical constructs included in the conceptual model were adapted from related literature and a set of hypotheses was developed. The hypotheses of the conceptual model were subsequently assessed with partial least squares structural equation modeling using a dataset of 456 Australian survey respondents. Findings: The model has strong explanatory power with an R2 of 69.5%. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and perceived risk are direct antecedents of consumers' usage intention of Open Banking. Social influence has a strong mediating effect on usage intention through performance expectancy. The effect of perceived risk is alleviated by effort expectancy and initial trust, while initial trust positively affects the effects of performance expectancy and effort expectancy on consumers' usage intention of Open Banking. Finally, financial literacy lowers initial trust towards Open Banking, possibly inducing consumer skepticism. Practical implications: The results suggest that practitioners should focus on performance expectancy as a primary driver of Open Banking adoption, while understanding the role of other drivers, such as social influence and perceived risk in developing marketing strategies. Policy makers are recommended to adopt a governance approach to build initial trust amongst consumers. Originality/value: This research contributes by providing an integrated and comprehensive model for explaining consumers' FinTech adoptions by extending the existing technology adoption model UTAUT to the Open Banking domain and integrating perceived risk, initial trust and financial literacy, thereby advancing and enriching the conceptual horizon of the extant literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Financial literacy; FinTech; Innovation adoption; Open banking; Perceived risk; Trust",,"Hoffmann, A.; Adelaide Business School, Australia; email: arvid.hoffmann@adelaide.edu.au",02652323,,,"Int.

In this work, we first collect the transaction data of Ethereum and build network models from a microlevel view and then use a link-prediction-based framework to quantify the impact of network characteristics on Ethereum evolution. Next, we explore the graph structure properties and the driving factors of newly generated transaction relationships. Experimental results show that the local and microscopic structure of Ethereum networks is star-shaped, and the transaction frequency of addresses has a great impact on the evolution of Ethereum transaction relationships. First-layer nodes of microstructures dominate the network evolution. Moreover, the degree of addresses is an effective basis for predicting the direction of new transactions. Potential further studies on Ethereum transaction link prediction are discussed, for example, the label effect of center addresses. © 2014 IEEE.","Complex network; cryptocurrency; Ethereum; network evolution; transaction relationships","Ethereum; Forecasting; 'current; Cryptocurrency; Driving factors; Evolution mechanism; Link prediction; Measurements of; Microscopic patterns; Networks evolutions; Transaction records; Transaction relationship; Complex networks","Wu, J.; School of Computer Science and Engineering, China; email: wujiajing@mail.sysu.edu.cn",2329924X,,,"IEEE Trans.

Organizations face significant challenges, such as demonstrating compliance (or auditability) and automated compliance verification due to the complex and dynamic nature of consent, as well as the scale at which compliance verification must be performed. Furthermore, the GDPR’s promotion of data protection by design and industrial interoperability requirements has created new technical challenges, as they require significant changes in the design and implementation of systems that handle personal data. We present a scalable data protection by design tool for automated compliance verification and auditability based on informed consent that is modeled with a knowledge graph. Automated compliance verification is made possible by implementing a regulation-to-code process that translates GDPR regulations into well-defined technical and organizational measures and, ultimately, software code.

Moreover, this paper explores different ways of conceptualising the Covid-19 impacts in terms of financial crimes and regulatory compliance patterns based on the surveys by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte. Findings: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought both challenges and opportunities to financial crime and regulatory compliance. In the aspects of financial crime patterns, this study found a reduction in physical crime whilst on the other hand increment in cybercrime. Nevertheless, this study discovered regulatory compliance not at a satisfactory stage even before the Covid-19 pandemic, let alone during the pandemic. Practical implications: This study implies that the financial institutions must work together to combat the risks of financial crimes, not only amongst the institutions but also with the regulators. Digitalisation and robust risk management need to be improved at a massive level to beat the criminals’ high fintech skills and systems. The initiatives of fund packages from the governments to assist the companies especially the small firms need to be fully used by the companies to improve regulatory compliance. Originality/value: Whilst some studies discussed the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, there are still scarce resources on the comparative analysis on the financial crime and regulatory compliance, not to mention the before and after effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. This is the first paper to integrate the issues surrounding the Covid-19 impact, financial crimes and regulatory compliance in Malaysia. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Covid-19; Financial crime; Fraud; Money laundering; Regulatory compliance",,"Yaacob, N.M.; Faculty of Accountancy, Malaysia; email: najihahm@tganu.uitm.edu.my",13590790,,,"J.

For this, first, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the relationships between business model innovation and SBMI literature. After this, we performed a systematic literature review to create a comprehensive framework for managing SBMI. The biblio-metric analysis showed that the SBMI stream grew quickly and significantly in recent years, evolving into a separated new research stream, which does not leverage recent business model innovation advancements. Through the performed analyses, we were able to discuss critical gaps in the SBMI literature and shed light on possible pathways to solve these gaps through lessons learned from business model innovation. We depicted five critical gaps for managing SBMI; (1) the need to understand the sustainable business model as a wicked problem, in which SBMI leads to “better than before” solutions calling for systematic SBMI, (2) the poor definition of distinctive dimensions of dynamic capabilities for SBMI, (3) the lack of studies exploring the role of open innovation for improving the SBMI process, (4) the lack of tools supporting SBMI implementation and (5) the need to explore game-changing, competitive advantages of SBMI. The findings of this study contribute to guiding future research on SBMI, which can be a basis for further efforts towards sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted a multiple-case study strategy for the purpose of theory building. Seven players from the Fintech ecosystem in Quebec (Canada) were selected, representing financial institutions, Fintech start-ups and Quebec’s financial cluster. Primary data was collected via in-depth interviews with ten respondents at the level of vice presidents, Managers, directors, chief executive officers and founders, and unobtrusive data – in the form of running records, mass-media news reports, presentations and proceedings from Fintech events.

The need for different types of FinTech services varies between regions. Services such as crowdfunding, neobanks, and InsurTech have potential in the ASEAN regions, especially with the positive attitude towards entrepreneurship and asset investments. In the SAARC regions, InsurTechs linked to health care has potential along with LendTechs and neobanks. We further note that males, and the young are more likely adopters of FinTechs in both regions.

The goal of the article is to analyze the growth and development of equity funding in FinTech companies in both countries. The underlying hypothesis for this investigation is the applicability of an exponential growth model for the examined funding rounds. The analysis shows that the German market has more FinTech start-ups pursuing equity funding rounds. From Pre-Seed to Series D funding, the considered investment market is about 18 times larger in Germany than it is in Russia. The German market shows strong evidence of exponentially increasing investment tickets based on the behavior of the total data set. This is further supported by testing exponential and linear models on the averages for the investment stages. In this analysis, the exponential model shows a significantly better fit than its linear counterpart. The analysis of the Russian market is not supportive of the hypothesis, as substantial evidence of the superiority of a linear model over an exponential model could be found.

This study also proposes a comprehensive legal framework to encourage and accelerate the growth of the Islamic economy. Design/methodology/approach: This study is the result of legal research with a statute approach and conceptual approach. The types of data used are legal materials consisting of primary legal materials and secondary legal materials. The technique of collecting legal materials is done by using library research techniques. The legal materials were analyzed using the legal norm method. Findings: Indonesia is a country with the largest Muslim population in the world. However, the market size of Indonesia’s Islamic fintech is still below Saudi Arabia, Iran, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Malaysia. Saudi Arabia’s Islamic fintech is the biggest market in the world, with $17.9bn worth of transactions in 2020 while Iran is at $9.2bn, UAE $3.7bn, Malaysia $3.0bn and Indonesia $2.9bn. This condition was due to various challenges in the Islamic fintech industry in Indonesia, including inadequate regulations; complicated permit procedures; misuse of fintech for financing terrorism; rampant occurrence of illegal fintech businesses; and consumer disputes in the fintech sector. These challenges require the construction of a comprehensive legal framework through the formation of an Act on Fintech.

Practical implications: The results of this research can be used as recommendations for the formulation of comprehensive policies for the growth and development of Islamic fintech. Social implications: Islamic fintech requires a comprehensive legal framework that functions to encourage the development of the Islamic fintech industry, digital economy growth and legal mitigation of various legal risks and misuse of fintech for financial crime and financing terrorism. Originality/value: This paper proposes an original idea of creating a legal framework in a form of the Islamic Fintech Act. The Act should cover such legal substances as follows: Islamic compliance; an integrated one-stop permit procedure; division of authority, coordination and synergy among authorities; prevention and resolution of digital financial system crisis; criminal sanctions; and consumer dispute resolution mechanisms and alternative institution for fintech consumer dispute resolution. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business law; Financial technology law; Indonesia; Islamic fintech; Law and regulation; Legal framework",,"Muryanto, Y.T.; Faculty of Law, Indonesia; email: yudhotaruno@staff.uns.ac.id",1754243X,,,"Int.

Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual foundations for a comprehensive transformation of the bank governance through financial technologies (fintechs) are underexplored. In order to develop such foundations, the authors adopt transaction cost economics (TCE), the concepts of external enablers and a modular organizational design, as well as a systematic literature review. Findings: The results point to three scenarios of the banks' scope, depending on the adopted technological mechanisms and related effects that change the characteristics of organizational activities, justifying new bank boundaries. The most advanced application of fintechs results in a modularized network scenario leading to the emergence of financial ecosystems. Research limitations/implications: The proposed micro-perspective of decisional rules in an individual organization is unique in the current literature that predominantly focuses on the banking sector at large. The identified scenarios are valuable for solid theoretical and empirical grounding and can be further exploited in decision simulations and empirical studies. Practical implications: The proposed theoretical framework points to the rationales and consequences of adopted technologies for the boundaries of a bank organization. Originality/value: This paper provides three contributions to the literature on technology-driven transformations of organizations with a focus on banks. First, the authors elaborate a theoretical framework for establishing the bank's boundaries in response to the expansion of financial technologies. Second, the authors add to the knowledge accumulation in the area of organizational transformations based on the ICT adoption, in particular, to the literature on the modular organizational design. Third, the authors contribute to the decision-maker practice by proposing the alternative options of banks' scope transformed through fintechs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bank governance; Financial technologies; Organizational boundaries; Transaction cost economics",,"Gancarczyk, M.; Department of Finance and International Economics, Poland; email: marta.gancarczyk@uj.edu.pl",09534814,,,"J.

It has become imperative to follow the recent trends in crime prevention, as they are proactive, partici-patory, stimulating the role of the individual and the com-munity, and using technology. For this reason, the paper aims to show the latest approaches and practices in preventing delinquency and crime. Based on an integrative literature review methodology using evaluation, analysis, and synthesis, this paper examined the new crime trends to analyze current prevention initiatives, practices, and strategies. The Kyoto Conference (March 2021) was a theoretical entry point for monitoring global trends in crime prevention. The analysis showed that prevention through social development, situational prevention, and communi-ty-based prevention remain the most used and practical approaches, greatly enhanced by using new technolo-gies. Results also showed that policies based on the city’s role and international coordination are among the latest trends. This paper also discussed the most critical tools in monitoring prevention programs, some models of comprehensive strategies, and the role of forensic sciences in developing prevention initiatives. Finally, the paper recommended making social development programs involving psychological factors a top priority, actively involving the community and civil society, creating an Arab observatory for crime, violence, and delinquency, founding a platform for the exchange of experiences and best practices, and launching an Arab Center for Youth Empowerment. The paper also recommended enhancing the role of forensic sciences in crime prevention, as they provide valuable data on the occurrence of criminal acts that can be used to predict and anticipate. © 2022.

By focusing on the nexus between digital finance and regional innovation efficiency, we first analyze the mechanism by which digital finance affects regional innovation efficiency, and then we empirically investigate its spatial spillover effect by employing the dynamic spatial Durbin model on the basis of a sample set of 31 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2020. The results reveal that regional innovation efficiency had a significant spatial correlation and time dependence, globally, during the study period. Digital finance significantly contributes to regional innovation efficiency improvement, and such an effect has a significant positive spatial spillover. The spatial effect decomposition results report that the spatial spillover effect of digital finance affecting regional innovation efficiency is stronger than the direct effect. Besides, all three sub-dimensions of digital finance have spatial spillover effects, and the heterogeneity between eastern and central-western regions is mainly reflected in the spatial spillover effects of digital finance. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

Starting from the premise that the EIOPA’s relevant initiatives are driven from the Authority’s normative and institutional environment as well as the perceived technological affordances of RegTech, this chapter provides a ‘reality check’ of the algorithmic future of EU financial supervision in the field of insurance as an aspect of EU financial markets’ governance. On the one hand, it finds that an important blind-spot in the EIOPA’s agenda is the absence of a concrete plan for a system of digital reporting. On the other hand, it examines what it takes to set up a system of digital reporting. To that end, it focuses on three interrelated issues: The technology that will be required to provide the infrastructure of digital reporting and its limitations, difficulties with the conversion of regulatory content into code, and issues of reporting architecture and governance. The ultimate objective of this chapter is to inform the agenda of the digital transformation of EU financial market oversight in anticipation of future challenges while relevant policy and legal debates are still on-going. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,"Georgosouli, A.; Centre for Commercial Law Studies (CCLS), United Kingdom; email: a.georgosouli@qmul.ac.uk",26621770,,,"AIDA.

This paper contextualises and interrogates the novelty of the RegTech phenomenon as expounded in recent years by industry practitioners, regulators and a growing chorus of scholars. Harnessing the notion of ‘imaginary’ from Science and Technology Studies, we identify a particular solutionist vision materialising across public documents from national and international financial regulators, industry organisations, as well as RegTech and consulting firms. We identify two failures of an emerging RegTech imaginary. First, is a dynamism failure in the way RegTech materialises static visions of regulation. Second, is a systems failure as the solutionist RegTech imaginary focuses on narrower, individual problems in finance at the expense of wider changes occurring since the 2007–8 global financial crisis. RegTech, we conclude, reflects continuities with a pre-crisis era and fails to tackle key market and regulatory changes occurring since. Our analysis holds implications for the turn to technological solutions in addressing persistent issues of instability in global financial governance. We point to the need for developing wider imaginaries of technological possibilities for regulation in an increasingly digital world. © 2022 The Author(s).

The measures the two countries take to prevent unfair competition in e-commerce are crucial for revising competition legislation, particularly in Indonesia. This research aimed to compare and contrast Indonesian and English commercial competition law in the digital age. A normative judicial research strategy was employed for this investigation. The data demonstrates that the United Kingdom and Indonesia impose barriers to market entry. Vertical price fixing, discriminatory pricing, and the preservation of resale prices are all illegal under England’s Competition Act of 1998. In Indonesia, anti-competitive price fixing is governed by Law No. 5 of 1999. The United Kingdom has favoured internet businesses over brick-and-mortar ones since Brexit. There are no regulations on internet business rivalry in Indonesia. Online and offline businesses are increasingly focusing on expanding their online presence. Whenever there are concerns that unfair competition in the online business sector harms the U.K. market, the Business Competition Supervisory Commission in Indonesia might launch an investigation. Indonesia’s anti-competition laws, particularly those about the internet, may be impacted by the Commerce Competition Supervisory Commission’s limited jurisdiction (buying and selling).

The main prerequisites were identified, and the role of financial and tax innovations in the development of the economy at the macro level was defined. Emphasis is on digital technologies as the main driving force of innovation in the financial and tax sector. The relationship between the concepts of “financial and tax innovations” and “financial engineering” has been established. The main directions of digitalization of the financial and tax sectors are identified. The digital technologies that have the greatest impact on financial and tax innovation are identified, namely: blockchain, Big Data, artificial intelligence, cloud technologies, the Internet of Things. The directions of legal regulation were substantiated and further steps to develop legal support for the digitalization of the financial sector were determined. To this end, the components of legal regulation, institutional regulation, and scientific and methodological regulation of digitalization of the financial sector are detailed. In contrast to numerous studies in the field of legal support and regulation of digitalization of the financial and tax sectors, it has been hypothesized and proved that the greatest effect is achieved with the harmonious interaction of institutional components. The system of management of financial and tax innovations in the context of digitalization has been improved. To this end, the stages of the transformation process of the financial and tax innovation management system in the context of digitalization were detailed and an algorithm for digitalization of the financial sector has been developed.

Yet, a significant and increasing number of regulations require firms to comply by specifying and communicating textual data to consumers and supervisors. Therefore, we develop a methodological framework for RIA in case of unstructured data following the design science research paradigm. The framework enables the application of textual analysis and natural language processing to assess the impact of regulatory actions that result in unstructured data and offers guidance on how to map suitable methods to the dimensions impacted by the regulation. We evaluate the framework by applying it to the European financial market regulation MiFID II, specifically the recent regulatory changes regarding best execution.

Using the Conditional Value-at-risk approach (ΔCoVaR) risk metric, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (Structural Vector Autoregression with Stochastic Volatility model [SV-TVP-SAVR]) model, and the generalized forecast error variance decomposition (Tvpdy) model, this paper discusses how financial leverage volatility shocks fintech sectoral risks and the evolution of the risk within fintech under the shocks on the basis of the classification criteria of the Chinese fintech enterprise database and daily trading data of A-share listed companies. The statistical results show that financial leverage volatility causes risk changes across fintech sectors, which is especially significant during economic downturns or government interventions. Also, under the shock of financial leverage volatility, the fintech sectors will absorb or diffuse risks outward through spillover channels, with significant differences in the risk spillover conditions of different types of sectors. Finally, the fintech sector can produce a contagion system with the Internet consumer finance, payment, and Internet microcommercial credit sectors as the core of risks, resulting in a systemic risk crisis.

The emergence of financial technology (FinTech) based applications has transformed the traditional banking and regulatory systems and enhanced customer satisfaction by providing a balanced environment for protecting its customers from risky behavior or other potential disruptions. Besides these critical applications of FinTech in the financial industry, it is not developed in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region as in China, United States, and other developed countries. In order to bridge the gaps in the extant by identifying the critical factors involved, this research work presents a systematic analysis of the available literature reported during the period ranging from 2016 to 2021. This systematic mapping of the extant was performed by selecting five different research questions. The key objectives of this systematic research work are, (1) To identify the barriers that restrict the rise of FinTech in the GCC region, (2) Analyze the behavior of different communities regarding the adaptation of FinTech by evaluating the case studies reported, (3) the impacts of FinTech on different communities in the GCC region. (4) The findings of this research work will not only help the state development bodies by encouraging its stakeholders to use FinTech-driven applications in banking, markets, etc. but it will also help the people in maintaining long-term connection with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, the Dutch regulators, Economic Affairs, the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), as well as with the Authority on Financial Markets (AFM), and (5) this study work will present new research directions for the research community to explore in the near future. © The Author(s) 2022.","banking system; finance; FinTech; GCC; Middle East; Systematic literature review","Commerce; Financial markets; Mapping; Banking systems; Customers' satisfaction; Financial technology; Gulf Cooperation Council; Information age; Middle East; Regulatory systems; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Technology based applications; Customer satisfaction","Khan, S.; Department of Accounting and Information Systems, Qatar; email: engr.sulaiman88@gmail.com",00202940,,MEACB,"Meas.

Losing trust in conventional banking, advancement of technology and internet globally, and customers craving for trustworthy and reliable financial systems are the main incentives of expansion and growth of Fintech and Islamic Finance. In view of this growth, the current study tests the adoption of the novel mechanism Fintech Value Chain Financing (FVCF) using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model among potential users, Aarti (middlemen) in the agriculture sector. A cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted; 500 questionnaires were distributed following purposive sampling to collect data for analysis. Findings revealed that perceived benefits expectancy, perceived efforts expectancy, perceived credibility, anxiety, and consumer innovativeness are strong predictors of adoption of FVCF. This study is pioneer in its kind. The study’s contribution to the literature is a newly operationalized instrument for the constructs along with other variables that extend the UTAUT model and the findings provide new insights to consider the UTAUT model to segregate organization based variables. This study is beneficial for the practitioners in Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) to update the financial system by using the FVCF. © 2022 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.","Aarti; agriculture; consumer innovativeness; financial institutions; Fintech value chain financing; UTAUT model",,"Maryam, S.Z.; Hailey College of Commerce, Pakistan; email: syedazeenat5@gmail.com",20421338,,,"Afr.

Despite the theoretical and practical magnitude of money laundering, international business (IB) research on the topic is scarce and scattered across multiple disciplines. Accordingly, this study aims to advance an integrated understanding of money laundering from the IB perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a systematic review of relevant literature and qualitatively analyze the content of 57 studies published on the topic during the past two decades. Findings: The authors identify five streams (5Cs) of research on money laundering in the IB context: the concept, characteristics, causes, consequences and controls. The analysis further indicates six theoretical approaches used in the past research. Notably, normative standards and business and economics theories are dominant in the extant research. Research limitations/implications: The authors review the literature on an under-researched but practically significant phenomenon and found potential for advancing its theoretical foundations. Hence, the authors propose a 5Cs framework and a future agenda for research and practice by introducing 21 future research questions and two plausible theories to help study the phenomenon more effectively in the future. Practical implications: In practical terms, the study extends the understanding of the money laundering phenomenon and subsequently helps mitigating the problem of money laundering in the IB environment, along with its harmful economic and societal impacts. Originality/value: The authors offer an integrative view on money laundering in the IB context. Additionally, the authors emphasize wider discussions on money laundering as a form of mega-corruption. © 2022, Emilia A.

Under the background of the digital economy in China, we studied how digital inclusive finance affects the high-quality development of the rural economy. For this purpose, we assembled the provincial panel data from 2009 to 2018 and constructed an index system of rural high-quality development and then calculated its index using the entropy weight method. FE regression model and RE regression model were employed for empirical analysis, and we constructed a nonlinear regression model to investigate the nonlinear relationship as well. Furthermore, systematic GMM and iterative GMM were used to solve the endogenous problem. We found that digital inclusive finance plays a significant and positive role in promoting rural high-quality development, mainly through the channel of economic efficiency, urban and rural structure, green ecological development, harmony of people's livelihood, and innovative development potential. Each subdimension of digital inclusive finance has a positive impact on rural high-quality development to different degrees. There is also a direct nonlinear relationship between the core variables, which act as a disincentive in the initial stage and boost after reaching a certain inflection point. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the construction of rural digital infrastructure, improve the digitalization of inclusive finance with the help of digital technologies such as cloud computing, and expand the breadth and depth of digital inclusive finance services in rural areas, especially in economically underdeveloped provinces and cities, to effectively promote the comprehensive and high-quality development of rural areas. © 2022 Le Sun and Congmou Zhu.",,,"Sun, L.; School of Finance, China; email: 1180156@zjhzcc.edu.cn",10260226,,,"Discrete Dyn.

Amid the pandemic of COVID-19 in the 21st century, the governments of many countries as well as healthcare industries, hospitals, doctors, and patients are facing a crucial threat of tampering and counterfeiting of vaccines and drugs. This is not an issue that can be ignored easily, as it troubles all of society in a significant way. New technology such as near field communication (NFC), combined with the latest technologies such as Hyperledger, blockchain, and the Internet of Things have given efficient results. The methodology used in this research manuscript (the authors named it “AKSHAT”) is that an NFC chip will be installed in the caps of medicines. When a consumer scans the label on a product with a phone or any NFC-enabled device, the device authenticates the product and informs as to whether it is a genuine product. When a consumer finds that the NFC seal is broken or if it looks intact but NFC data cannot be read, then apparently the product has been tampered with. In NFC, all data and information can be stored and cannot be changed again. The research results presented here establish that NFC is time-efficient, cost-effective, secure, and accurate. With the use of NFC tags, registered transactions on a private network and the tracing of the vaccine are very easy. The authors’ team has demonstrated this as a product that can currently store every transaction as immutable and transparent. The proposed anticounterfeiting solution “AKSHAT” uses NTAG-213 based tags, which are cost-effective as well as have a mutual understanding with all NFC-enabled smartphones. This provides the option for all product manufacturers and brand owners to integrate NFC technology at a fraction of the money. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Fintech is an emerging financial model in which literature is still insufficient and knowledge is not fully systematized. To bridge this gap, a bibliometric analysis was performed in this study through searches on the Web of Science and Scopus databases between 2008 and 2021. The results reveal that the scientific community’s growing attention towards the study of FinTech has translated into an increase in published studies. Also, a large number of different methods used to analyze FinTech was noted, with qualitative studies standing out. In addition, it was observed that FinTech has been analyzed from different theoretical strands in areas that go beyond the finance or technology realms, making room for future interdisciplinary studies. We conclude that scientific contributions that support a better understanding of the FinTech phenomenon have a potential social impact, as the efficiency of financial markets, the inclusion of more individuals in these markets, and the mitigation of transaction-related risks could be improved by market applications stemming from these studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bibliometric analysis; Disruptive innovation; Financial ecosystem; Financial technology; FinTech",,"Cuenca-Jiménez, M.T.; Department of Business Science, Ecuador; email: mtcuenca@utpl.edu.ec",21984182,,,"Stud.

Design/methodology/approach: The theory of perceived risk and the behavioural finance paradigm were used to develop a conceptual model of retail investors’ initial trust in FRAs. Data collected from 554 young retail investors (YRIs) from Sweden and Malaysia were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings: The results of this study indicate that the amount of public information, social media information-seeking and a rational decision style are significantly related to initial trust in FRAs, which in turn is significantly and positively related to the behavioural intention to use this technology. However, none of the risks under study significantly affect the initial trust in FRAs. Practical implications: Information is vital to inducing YRIs to rely on FRAs, so the more public and social media information is available, the higher their intention to use this technology. However, YRIs vary in decision style, and the results suggest implementing a more sophisticated system than the current “one-size-fits-all” approach to YRI behaviour. Originality/value: The empirical-based model enhances the knowledge of the initial phase of trust-building, when YRIs lack sufficient experience of FRAs.

The risks are accumulated synchronously in the middle of establishing differentiated competitive advantages through information technology innovations by the new fintech institutions. In this study, a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process is adopted to figure out the risk evaluation of the new fintech institutions in China, identifying those at risk as early as possible. Firstly, several level 1 indicators of the risk evaluation system of the new fintech institutions and corresponding subordinate level 2 indicators are determined, followed by rating the level 2 indicators of each new fintech institution ready for risk evaluation ranking, which leads to the risk evaluation matrix of each level 1 indicator. Secondly, the new fintech institutions are classified into the theoretically ideal ""optimal,""""medium,""and ""worst""categories by establishing the membership matrix of each level 1 indicator in the application of linear transformation formula. Thirdly, the degree of proximity is exploited in comparison of the fuzzy sets in pairs to form the fuzzy recognition model of each level 1 indicator in pursuit of the new fintech institutions least risky regarding each level 1 indicator. Finally, the fuzzy recognition models of each level 1 indicator are integrated into the construction of the fuzzy recognition model regarding the whole risk evaluation system to achieve the risk ranking of the new fintech institutions.

The paper appraises how key features of EU and UK regulatory and policy initiatives can contribute to a functional framework for RegTech and SupTech. Design/methodology/approach: The paper refers to the most comprehensive empirical findings within the EU and the UK on RegTech and SupTech, including reports released by the European Banking Authority and the Bank of England. As data is only gradually becoming available about the true rate of adoption of RegTech and SupTech, the paper identifies salient areas that warrant analysis from emerging findings. In light of the relatively restricted sources of empirical data, the article’s methodological approach is directed towards the most wide-ranging and detailed sources that are currently available at EU and UK levels. Findings: The paper reveals distinct variations in how the EU and UK have pursued regulatory approaches towards RegTech and SupTech growth. However, there are many shared features in the respective approaches. The paper argues that a regulatory framework should ideally be imbued with overarching strategies and policy objectives, as well as with practical measures through innovation facilitators, such as sandboxes. Yet, legislative (top-down) intervention will be the significant ingredient in guaranteeing legal clarity for RegTech and SupTech. Originality/value: By understanding the nuances in EU and UK approaches, the paper advocates for pragmatic reasoning when formulating a regulatory response. The importance of the article is in its focus on the elements of EU and UK regulatory approaches that are most capable of guaranteeing clarity on standards relating to RegTech and SupTech.

The practitioner literature subsequently reported on alternative finance models, the introduction of cryptocurrencies, and risks and regulatory issues. Academic literature on FinTech began to rise from 2014 onwards, focusing initially on the development of FinTech in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Research attention subsequently shifted to FinTech innovations (alternative finance, cryptocurrency and blockchain, machine-based methods for financial analysis and forecasting, including artificial intelligence), as well as risk and regulatory issues. IS work on FinTech started to emerge from 2015 onwards, initially focusing on mobile payment systems and peer-to-peer lending.

Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an important part of effectively preventing money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the implementation of RegTech related to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, especially in the Indonesian banking sector, has not been widely studied and discussed. Therefore, this study aims to provide empirical testing evidence regarding the effectiveness of RegTech implementation in the Indonesian banking sector to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses primary data obtained through a survey distributed to 160 bankers who work in eight different banks in Indonesia with a 95% confidence level and a confidence interval of 7.75. The criteria needed to determine the sample in this study are individuals who actively work as staff whose work is directly related to banking; individuals who are actively working in banks registered with OJK; individuals who have been actively working in the banking sector in Indonesia for at least three years. The data that has been obtained were analyzed using the SmartPLS application to test the validity and reliability, descriptive statistics and structural models (inner model). Findings: The results of this study indicate that electronic know your customer (eKYC), transaction monitoring (TM), cost and time efficiencies (CTE) influence the prevention of anti-money laundering (AML) and countering financing of terrorism (CFT) in the Indonesian banking sector. However, eKYC and CTE have little influence on AML-CFT in the Indonesian banking sector. Meanwhile, TM has a moderate influence on AML-CFT in the Indonesian banking sector. In addition, in general, most bankers agree that the bank they work for has followed the guidelines, policies and regulations that have been given.

Consequently, the need to examine factors contributing to the diffusion rate of MPS in this era is substantiated. Thus, this study employs Structural Equation Model (SEM) with social media administered survey data to estimate the nexus between MPS diffusion and technological factors, non-technological factors, and environmental factors. Results suggest that although MPS diffusion increased globally, mobile payment services have the highest diffusion rate. This is because of convenience, availability, and cost. Further, technological, non-technological, and environmental factors all contribute positively to the high rate of diffusion. Environmental factors like an escalation in the Covid-19 cases, recommendations from the center for disease control positively mediates the relationship between MPS diffusion and non-technological factors. Thus, to encourage mass diffusion and continual usage of MPS during and after the pandemic, cost of usage, convenience, accessibility, and mobile-based applications should be bundled for optimized user experience. © 2022 by the authors.","Covid-19; Diffusion; FinTech; Mobile Payment; Structural Equation Model",,,21830606,,,"J.

Using the objective weighting CRITIC method, we calculate China's provincial FinTech innovation index from 2008 to 2019, to explore the relationship between regulatory information symmetry and the FinTech innovation level. The results show that regulatory information symmetry and FinTech innovation level have an inverted U-shaped nonlinear relationship. Following the improvement of symmetry in regulatory information, the FinTech innovation level first increases and then decreases. These findings are consistent with the predictions of the cognitive closure theory, cognitive needs theory, and optimal information theory.

The word ""access control""refers to an organization's policy for authorizing access procedures, the mechanisms that implement and enforce the policy, and the model that the policy and procedures are built on. Adopting new technology may give rise to specific cyber threats that decrease or degrade business operations. The paper has designed to discuss the artificial intelligence-based access control system as a necessary component of governing and safeguarding the financial sector's information assets in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Due to the dynamic and complicated nature of security rules for access control, organizations that employ web-enabled remote access in conjunction with applications access deployed over several networks face various obstacles, including increased operational complexity and monitoring concerns. Organizations spend a vast budget on securing their business. As the industry trend has shifted to intelligent internet-based companies on the same side, the cyber threat has become a challenge for the researcher to find the solution. A systematic research is conducted to fill the gaps in the existing literature by picking the most relevant research papers (126) from the four most reputable online repositories based on the four research questions specified.

The structured equation model was implemented by using Smart PLS to examine the relationships. A total of 435 FinTech users from Bangladesh participated in data collection. The study concludes that the attitude of the local users is highly positive towards the FinTech adoption. Additionally, a perceived secured system and perceived cost efficiency hold a strong influence on the user. Although, perceived awareness as a moderator strengthens the relationship.

This is especially due to issues affecting financial intermediaries and customers, and potential risks of stability of the financial system. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of Fintech in the banking industry thus to update the knowledge about technology innovation in the banking sector, identify the major trends in the domain and delineate future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: The study reviews 377 articles indexed on Scopus from 2014 to 2021 that focus on Fintech and the banking industry. The methodology adopted is structured in two steps: the keywords selection and the analysis of the documents extracted. The first step identified “Fintech” and “bank” as keywords to be searched within the title, abstract or keywords of documents indexed on Scopus; whereas the second step combined R and VOSviewer to provide a descriptive analysis of the dataset and the analysis of keywords and occurrences, respectively. Findings: Results achieved in the study allow providing a systemic view of the Fintech in the banking industry, including the emergent phenomenon of digital banking. In particular, it is provided with a general overview and descriptive information on the entire sample of documents analyzed, their authors, the keywords used and the most cited works.

In this specific context, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has acquired an increasing importance, with a larger share of loans having been originated through P2P platforms instead of traditional banking channels. This trend has been welcomed by policy makers as a move towards alternative market-based finance, which should contribute to better risk diversification by moving risks away from systemic financial institutions. At the same time, this shift presents a number of regulatory questions that have remained largely unexplored. This is so because the nature and role of P2P platforms have remained loosely defined, which means that it has been difficult to identify relevant regulatory challenges emerging from these channels of finance. This research tackles two interrelated questions. First, it addresses the conceptual redefinition of financial intermediation. This enables understanding of the function of P2P platforms, and whether they have supplemented the intermediation role traditionally conducted by banks.

The study further explores the moderating impact of regulatory enforcement on compliance officers in the banking and money service business (MSB) sectors. The analysis is conducted to find the important factors that contribute to the issues of risk judgement among compliance officers to establish effective anti-money laundering (AML) and countering financing of terrorism compliance at the financial institutions, as highlighted in the National Risk Assessment Report 2017 by the Central Bank of Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental study with four different scenarios of case studies distributed to 124 compliance officers at the banking and MSB sectors was conducted via online platforms. The paper uses a quantitative approach via structural equation modelling. Findings: The result shows a significant effect of customer risk determinants and regulatory enforcement on money laundering risk judgement, taking into account competency as the control measure. A further test on the interaction effects of both determinants shows a significant result on the money laundering risk judgement. The empirical evidence indicated that regulatory enforcement influenced compliance officers’ money laundering risk judgement and suspicious transaction report submission. In other words, the banking and MSB sectors’ AML compliance significantly depends on the regulators’ enforcement activity. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to two independent variables: regulatory enforcement and customer risk determinants. Future studies may consider other factors affecting compliance officers’ money laundering risk judgement, such as technical competency, knowledge management, digitalization and technology and ethical issues. Practical implications: This study provides several theoretical and practical implications. Emphasizing the excellent quality of judgement and, eventually, good quality of reporting the suspicious transactions will not be achieved merely from enforcing fines and punishment, but comprehensive measures must be taken. Increasing the competency and training, educating the compliance officers, supporting the industry and practitioners with incentives and digitalization, enhancing the campaign and awareness among the public and standardizing the policy shall be the good initiatives for the regulatory enforcement to establish. Originality/value: This paper provides a valuable contribution to the body of knowledge and fulfills the significant gaps in the literature on money laundering, not to mention, the integration between behavioural studies and anti-money laundering compliance, which has scarcely been statistically evident from the research studies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer risk determinants; Experimental study; Money laundering; Regulatory enforcement",,"Jamil, A.H.; Accounting Research Institute, Malaysia; email: ainul.jamil@gmail.com",13685201,,,"J.

Three categories of innovation facilitators emerged from the literature capturing the perspective of regulators, incumbents and new entrants. Each identified instrument is defined and its processes and implications described. Many initiatives were led by regulators, revealing a regulatory strategy change from risk-based to opportunity-based regulation, with regulatory sandboxes being the most commonly adopted instrument. Incumbent-led innovation facilitators were also identified and typically took the form of corporate incubation models, co-working spaces, venture funds and innovation platforms to support financial institutions with partnerships, acquisitions or self-development. Lastly, the literature review revealed innovator-led instruments to support start-ups with raising capital. Based on our results, we discuss several important observations and propose avenues for future research capturing each of the identified perspectives.

In the expansion of its economy, over the last decade, Vietnam has entered a series of free trade agreements, such as the European Union–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) in 2020. In that context, this study assesses the performance of Vietnam’s banks in the period of 2020–2021 and explores the relationship between performance and various demographic and environmental variables. This study utilizes data envelopment analysis with two disposability concepts where desirable outputs (e.g., return on equity) are maximized while undesirable outputs (e.g., non-performing loan ratio) are minimized. Subsequently, Tobit and bootstrap truncated regression analyses are conducted for the testing of two hypotheses: (1) EVFTA’s commitments, including the updating of the Fintech system, may be positively associated with bank’s performance, and (2) Locations of banks, encumbered by heterogeneous levels of urban concentration and real estate development in different regions, may be associated with the banks’ performance. The findings are twofold: (1) While EVFTA can contribute to Vietnamese banks’ financial profit performance through foreign trading and hedging activities, it may harm banks’ financial health performance due to Fintech-originated bad debts and a lack of relevant regulations; and (2) Banks in southern Vietnam outperform those in northern Vietnam in managing their credit risk by better controlling of bad debts, which result primarily from the volatility of the real estate market and from better positive externalities, in terms of economic, cultural, and political conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

After the 2008 financial crisis the remit of a bank Treasury has expanded in terms of scope and strategic significance, evolving from a transactional cash manager to a balance sheet custodian. In order to meet this broader strategic mandate Treasurers must consider ways to become more efficient and streamlined. Adoption of digital technologies and related innovation that underpins the Fourth Industrial Revolution can address many of the traditional Treasury challenges and deliver a wide range of benefits. The adoption of digital technology in bank Treasuries tend to be lower than in other business areas within a bank. There are a number of reasons, but it often includes the lack of a well-articulated digital transformation roadmap. There is thus a need for researching a Treasury specific approach that can provide guidance on developing a digital implementation strategy and enable the transition towards a next generation ‘smart’ digital Treasury department.

However, the regulatory mode under the traditional regulatory framework in China is difficult to effectively deal with the potential risks of FinTech innovations, which leads to frequent risk events. Firstly, based on the in-depth analysis of some research reports and regulatory policies, we clearly define the development status and essential characteristics of FinTech companies and regulatory authorities. Secondly, we construct a two-player evolutionary game model to depict the evolutionary game behavior between FinTech companies and regulatory authorities and analyze influencing factors of their strategic choices. We find that strategic choices of FinTech companies are mainly affected by extra benefits from non-compliance innovation, rewards from compliance innovation and penalty intensity from regulatory authorities, and strategic choices of regulatory authorities are mainly affected by regulatory costs, social evaluation and negative externalities. Finally, based on the realities of excessive innovations and insufficient regulations in China’s FinTech industry, we put forward some policy suggestions to promote the effective regulations of FinTech innovations and achieve a balance between regulation and innovation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bounded rationality; effective regulation; emerging technologies; FinTech",,"Li, H.; Business School, Australia; email: m.li@latrobe.edu.au",10438599,,,"Econ.

This paper investigated the factors influencing the attitudes and intention of the end-users towards using Fintech services within the purview of an expanded technology acceptance model (TAM). The study was conducted on 467 end-users in Lagos State, Nigeria, using structural equation model analysis. The results revealed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, service trust and social influence have positive and significant impact on users’ attitude towards Fintech service with path weights of 0.55, 0.63, 0.27 and 0.41, respectively, at 1% level of significance. In addition to this, users’ attitude towards Fintech services is positively significant in influencing the adoption of Fintech service with path weight of 0.85 at 1% level of significance. The study suggests that more investment is made in Fintech innovations and that banks sensitize the general public using social media, TV and radio stations. Further, proper regulatory measures by the relevant regulatory agency must be implemented to instil confidence and trust in the end-users.

Information about the consumer and their characteristics has nowadays become a service or market commodity thanks to which new economic processes, based on the use of advanced data processing technologies, are created. In digital space, new types of DDBM are established, which provide entrepreneurs with added value, based on the mass use of the consumer’s data collected often without their knowledge, on the margins of legality. This paper analyzes the impact of the development of DDBMs on selected privacy areas: personal data, the right to be forgotten, confidentiality of communications, one’s image and identity. In each of these areas, situations are identified that indicate a progressive re-evaluation of citizens’ privacy rights. The authors suggest that disruption of the balance between the right to privacy and business objectives may lead to unambiguous consequences, not only for the consumer (EU citizen), but also for the business entities. © 2021, University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw.

However, no serious scholarly attempt has been made to assess how these technologies have in fact been applied to real-world health care contexts. Objective: The primary aim of this paper is to assess whether blockchain's theoretical potential to deliver transformative benefits to health care is likely to become a reality by undertaking a critical investigation of the health care sector's actual experience of blockchain technologies to date. Methods: This mixed methods study entailed a series of iterative, in-depth, theoretically oriented, desk-based investigations and 2 focus group investigations. It builds on the findings of a companion research study documenting real-world engagement with blockchain technologies in health care. Data were sourced from academic and gray literature from multiple disciplinary perspectives concerned with the configuration, design, and functionality of blockchain technologies. The analysis proceeded in 3 stages. First, it undertook a qualitative investigation of observed patterns of blockchain for health care engagement to identify the application domains, data-sharing problems, and the challenges encountered to date. Second, it critically compared these experiences with claims about blockchain's potential benefits in health care. Third, it developed a theoretical account of challenges that arise in implementing blockchain in health care contexts, thus providing a firmer foundation for appraising its future prospects in health care. Results: Health care organizations have actively experimented with blockchain technologies since 2016 and have demonstrated proof of concept for several applications (use cases) primarily concerned with administrative data and to facilitate medical research by enabling algorithmic models to be trained on multiple disparately located sets of patient data in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. However, blockchain technology is yet to be implemented at scale in health care, remaining largely in its infancy. These early experiences have demonstrated blockchain's potential to generate meaningful value to health care by facilitating data sharing between organizations in circumstances where computational trust can overcome a lack of social trust that might otherwise prevent valuable cooperation. Although there are genuine prospects of using blockchain to bring about positive transformations in health care, the successful development of blockchain for health care applications faces a number of very significant, multidimensional, and highly complex challenges. Early experience suggests that blockchain is unlikely to rapidly and radically revolutionize health care. Conclusions: The successful development of blockchain for health care applications faces numerous significant, multidimensional, and complex challenges that will not be easily overcome, suggesting that blockchain technologies are unlikely to revolutionize health care in the near future. © Karen Yeung.

The literature on healthcare improvement demonstrates the persistence of these problems. In this project, the Access-Risk-Knowledge (ARK) Platform, which supports the implementation of improvement projects, was deployed across three healthcare organisations to address risk management for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). In each organisation, quality and safety experts initiated an ARK project and participated in a follow-up survey and focus group. The platform was then evaluated against a set of fifteen needs related to complex system transformation. While the results highlighted concerns about the platform’s usability, feedback was generally positive regarding its effectiveness and potential value in supporting HCAI risk management. The ARK Platform addresses the majority of identified needs for system transformation; other needs were validated in the trial or are undergoing development. This trial provided a starting point for a knowledge-based solution to enhance organisational governance and develop shared knowledge through a Community of Practice that will contribute to sustaining and generalising that change. © 2021 by the authors.

It draws on the classical theory of banking and the literature on digital transformation. It provides an explanation for existing trends and, by extending the theory of the banking firm, it illustrates how financial intermediation will be impacted by innovative financial technology applications. It further reviews the options that established banks will have to consider in order to mitigate the threat to their profitability. Deposit taking and lending are considered in the context of the challenge made from shadow banking and the all-digital banks. The paper contributes to an understanding of the future of banking, providing a framework for scholarly empirical investigation. In the discussion, four possible strategies are proposed for market participants, (1) customer retention, (2) customer acquisition, (3) banking as a service and (4) social media payment platforms.

With the rise of financial technology (FinTech), which uses mobile devices and applications as promotional platforms, biometrics has the important role of strengthening the identification of such applications for security. However, users still have privacy and trust concerns about biometrics. Previous studies have demonstrated that the technology acceptance model (TAM) can rigorously explain and predict user acceptance of new technologies. This study therefore modifies the TAM as a basic research architecture. Based on a literature review, we add two new variables, namely, “perceived privacy” and “perceived trust,” to extend the traditional TAM to examine user acceptance of biometric identification in FinTech applications. First, we apply the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the defined objects and relevant criteria of the research framework. Second, we use the AHP results in the scenario analysis to explore biometric identification methods that correspond to objects and criteria. The results indicate that face and voice recognition are the two most preferred identification methods in FinTech applications. In addition, there are significant changes in the results of the perceived trust and perceived privacy dominant scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s).","AHP; Biometric identification; FinTech applications; Perceived privacy; Perceived trust",,"Wang, J.S.; Institute of Technology Management, 1001 Ta-Hsueh Road, Taiwan; email: vincent.mt98g@nctu.edu.tw",21994730,,,"Financial Innov.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

This study contributes to the existing literature by identifying the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives to improve the financial performance of European banks. Our empirical findings illustrate that results are coherent, reliable, and identify “competitive advantage” as the most important factor among Fintech-based determinants. Moreover, “payment and money transferring systems” are the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives. It is recommended that, among Fintech-based investments, European banks should mainly focus on payment and money transferring alternatives to attract the attention of customers and satisfy their expectations. This is also believed to have a positive impact on the ease of bank’ receivable collection. Another important point is that Fintech-based investments in money transferring systems could help to decrease costs. © 2021, The Author(s).","DEMATEL; European banking industry; Financial technology; Interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS",,"Olgu Akdeniz, Ö.; College of Administrative Sciences and Economics, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, Sarıyer, Turkey; email: oolgu@ku.edu.tr",21994730,,,"Financial Innov.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus

If government policies are incapable of handling money laundering activities in an appropriate way, the control of the economy can be transferred to criminals. The current literature provides various technical solutions, such as clustering-based anomaly detection techniques, rule-based systems, and a decision tree algorithm, to control such activities that can aid in identifying suspicious customers or transactions. However, the literature provides no effective and appropriate solutions that could aid in identifying relationships between suspicious customers or transactions. The current challenge in the field is to identify associated links between suspicious customers who are involved in money laundering. To consider this challenge, this paper discusses the challenges associated with identifying relationships such as business and family relationships and proposes a model to identify links between suspicious customers using social network analysis (SNA). The proposed model aims to identify various mafias and groups involved in money laundering activities, thereby aiding in preventing money laundering activities and potential terrorist financing. The proposed model is based on relational data of customer profiles and social networking functions metrics to identify suspicious customers and transactions. A series of experiments are conducted with financial data, and the results of these experiments show promising results for financial institutions who can gain real benefits from the proposed model. © 2021, The Author(s).","Anti-money laundering; Customer profile; Relational analysis; Relationships; Social network analysis",,"Shaikh, A.K.; Department of Information Systems, Oman; email: shaikh@squ.edu.om",21961115,,,"J.

Metahuman systems will change many facets of the way we think about organizations and work. They will push information systems research in new directions that may involve a revision of the field’s research goals, methods and theorizing. Information systems researchers can look beyond the capabilities and constraints of human learning toward hybrid human/machine learning systems that exhibit major differences in scale, scope and speed. We review how these changes influence organization design and goals. We identify four organizational level generic functions critical to organize metahuman systems properly: delegating, monitoring, cultivating, and reflecting. We show how each function raises new research questions for the field. We conclude by noting that improved understanding of metahuman systems will primarily come from learning-by-doing as information systems scholars try out new forms of hybrid learning in multiple settings to generate novel, generalizable, impactful designs. Such trials will result in improved understanding of metahuman systems.

Yet policing responses continue to apply traditional law enforcement methods to detect, identify and disrupt criminal actors in financial systems. The purpose of this paper is to challenge existing thinking around law enforcement practices in financial crime within an Australian context, by presenting an alternative model grounded in management cybernetics and systemic design (SD), which the author terms “cyber-systemics”. Design/methodology/approach: This study reflects on prior research work across cybernetics and SD to suggest an integrated approach as a conceptually useful basis for considering regulation of financial crime, and to demonstrate utility using a case study. Findings: The Fintel Alliance between financial crime regulators and financial institutions in Australia demonstrates a strong connection with, and example of, this study’s cyber-systemic regulatory framework. It will be demonstrated that the form of co-design framework offered under cyber-systemics is both consistent with cybernetic and SD literature, but also a means of avoiding regulatory disconnection in times of change and disruption. This study also invites consideration of how future forms of governance might be structured using cyber-systemics as a conceptual backbone. Research limitations/implications: This work proposes a novel methodology at odds with traditional law enforcement ways of doing, inevitably requiring a change of regulatory mindset. In addition, this paper is purely conceptual and therefore more research on an empirical basis is required to prove the potential benefits in a real-world regulatory environment.

Fintech covers an enormous range of activities from data security to financial service deliverables that enable the companies to automate their existing business structure and introduce innovative products and services. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for scholars and professionals to identify the future trends and directions of the topic. This is why the present study conducted a bibliometric analysis in social, environmental, and computer sciences fields to analyse the implementation of environment-friendly computer applications to benefit societal growth and well-being. We have used the ‘bibliometrix 3.0’ package of the r-program to analyse the core aspects of fintech systematically. The study suggests that ‘ACM International Conference Proceedings’ is the core source of published fintech literature. China leads in both multiple and single country production of fintech publications. Bina Nusantara University is the most relevant affiliation. Arner and Buckley provide impactful fintech literature. In the conceptual framework, we analyse relationships between different topics of fintech and address dynamic research streams and themes. These research streams and themes highlight the future directions and core topics of fintech. The study deploys a co-occurrence network to differentiate the entire fintech literature into three research streams. These research streams are related to ‘cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, financial technology’, ‘financial industry stability, service, innovation, regulatory technology (regtech)’, and ‘machine learning and deep learning innovations’. The study deploys a thematic map to identify basic, emerging, dropping, isolated, and motor themes based on centrality and density. These various themes and streams are designed to lead the researchers, academicians, policymakers, and practitioners to narrow, distinctive, and significant topics. © 2021 by the authors.

This study purposes to explore the evolutionary game relationship between FinTech innovation and regulation by constructing both static and dynamic earmarking game models. Design/methodology/approach: A simulation experiment was conducted using primary data obtained from a commercial bank in China. Findings: The results of the theoretical analysis of evolutionary game models were consistent with the corresponding simulation results, proving the validity of the proposed evolutionary game models. It was also found that the dynamic earmarking game model was more stable and effective than the static earmarking game model in promoting FinTech innovation and regulation. Furthermore, when the regulators utilised a dynamic earmarking mechanism, the evolutionary path of financial institutions and regulators' behaviour strategies took the shape of a spiral and eventually converged to a central point, indicating the existence of an evolutionary stable strategy and Nash equilibrium. Finally, because the behaviour strategies of financial institutions were mainly influenced by the regulators' policies, the regulators were inspired to adjust the corresponding regulation policies on FinTech innovation. Originality/value: This study bridges the knowledge gap in the existing literature on financial innovation and regulation, in particular by establishing evolutionary game models from the perspective of financial earmarking policies. Also, the case study for simulation experiments can gain a more intuitive insight into FinTech innovation and financial earmarking policies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Effective regulation; Evolutionary game theory; Financial earmarking policy; Financial institutions; FinTech innovation","Banking; Commercial bank; Design/methodology/approach; Evolutionary game models; Evolutionary games; Evolutionary path; Evolutionary stable strategies; Financial innovation; Financial institution; Fintech","Bao, H.; School of Spatial Planning and Design, China; email: haijun_bao@126.com",02635577,,IMDSD,"Ind Manage Data Sys",Article,"Final","",Scopus

Using a new hand-collected multisource database that maps FinTech start-ups incorporated in the UK from 2010 to 2015, this study examines how the characteristics of FinTech start-ups affect the types of financing used in the first three years after incorporation. The novelty of this study consists in the identification and analysis of the determinants that enable FinTech start-ups to obtain long-term debt and hence to finance their growth. The analysis is primarily conducted via a Tobit regression model. This paper contributes to the literature since we still have limited understanding of the financing of FinTech firms, even if academic literature examining the financing of start-ups has expanded in the last few years. The results from the empirical analysis demonstrate that unregulated FinTech start-ups are more likely to be financed with long-term debt. Asset structure, owner characteristics and the specific FinTech activity influence the funding source. Moreover, FinTech start-ups backed by equity investors receive less long-term debt funding than their peers. A better understanding of the debt financing of FinTech start-ups provides managers with valuable insights into ways of managing their firms. Furthermore, our results have relevant implications for the employment, competition and innovation, given the role that start-ups generally play in the economy. The study is limited to a sample of FinTech start-ups incorporated in an advanced economy, and thus the generalization of the presented results to developing economies will require caution. © 2021 The Authors","Debt; Fintech; Regulation; Start-up; Tobit; Venture capital",,"Chesini, G.; Department of Business Administration, Via Cantarane, 24, Italy; email: giusy.chesini@univr.it",25307614,,,"J.

The authors have proposed a methodology to evaluate frequent item sets of web parts over a dedicated time. Based on the verification of applied methodology on two commercial banks, the results show that stakeholders' interest in disclosures is highest in the first quarter at each year and after turbulent times in 2009 their interests decreased.

In this study, we adapt the multiple streams framework – often used for explaining agenda-setting and policy adoption – to examine the phenomenon. We hypothesize how technological change affects policy-making and identify conditions under which the streams can be (de-)coupled. We trace the formulation of the General Data Protection Regulation to show that the regulation occupied the legislative agenda when a policy window was exploited through policy entrepreneurship to frame technological change as a problem for data privacy and legislative harmonization within the European Union. Although constituencies interested in promoting internet technologies made every effort to stall the regulation, various actors, activities, and events helped the streams remain coupled, eventually leading to its adoption. We conclude that the alignment of problem, policy, politics, and technology – through policy entrepreneurship – influences the timing and design of technology regulation. © 2021 The Authors.

The recent COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on banking, one being that its aftershock might lead to an acceleration of digitalisation efforts in core bank management departments. The reason is that the COVID-19 pandemic is dangerously unique. It differs from the 2008 financial crisis in that it is an exogenous risk that is not the result of the unravelling of previous financial imbalances. It is truly an uncertain event, with a wide range of outcomes that depends on unpredictable noneconomic factors. Therefore, the challenges facing banks and the course of action required are divergent from the situation post-2008. The purpose of the paper is to identify a few of the effects COVID-19 had on banks, but particularly focus on its impact on the responsibilities of internal management departments such as treasury, risk and finance. The reason is that the crisis highlighted some of the pressure points that exist in traditional approaches and technology solutions. The paper postulates that the pandemic might be the catalyst that speeds up the pre-COVID trend of adopting digital technology in treasury, risk and finance and thereby drive establishment of smart analytical centres. The advantage of smart analytical centres is bank management departments that will be better prepared, not just to handle future crises through intelligent and rapid decision-making, but also better equipped to enhance day-to-day operations in business-as-usual times. An implication emphasised in this paper is that to establish smart analytical centres, it is vital to study the applicability and benefits of digital technologies, as well as recognise the importance of putting a well-defined digital transformation plan in place. © Henry Stewart Publications.","COVID-19; Digital technology; Digital transformation; Smart analytical centres; Treasury risk and finance departments",,,17528887,,,"J.

Regulators recognise the magnitude of the risks that institutions face and are demanding that they become resilient — that is, they are able to absorb, adapt or recover from threats, stressors or shocks. This, however, is more easily said than done. The objective of this paper is to inform senior risk professionals on how resilience might be achieved by providing a much-needed frame of reference for those planning to transform their complex and chaotic organisations to resilient complex adaptive systems. Inter alia we delineate a logical model, based on conceptualising firms as resilient complex adaptive systems (RCASs), which elaborates the necessary and sufficient conditions for resilience in organisations. This general model can be applied to substantive areas of operations within financial enterprises to make them resilient in the face of endogenous and exogenous risk events, while meeting regulatory requirements. © Henry Stewart Publications.","Complex adaptive systems; Digital transformation; Operational capabilities; Operational risk; Organisational learning; Resilience",,,17528887,,,"J.

The results show that the development of digital finance has significantly driven economic growth, which is quantitatively robust after the selection of historical data as instrumental variables and other robustness tests. A heterogeneity analysis proved that provinces in the central and western regions, which have a lower urbanization rate and lower physical capital, more clearly embody the facilitating impacts of digital finance on economic growth compared to their counterparts in other regions. Further analysis found that the development of digital finance has spurred the liberation of regional entrepreneurship, which in turn promoted economic growth—that is, there is an entrepreneurial channel by which digital finance could boost economic growth. © 2021 by the authors.

But digitalisation poses a problem for corporate reporting. Within internationally accepted accounting practice, ‘principles-based’ standards give companies significant discretion in deciding what they disclose and how they report accounts of their activity. How would the principles-based nature of corporate reporting be influenced by the construction of a taxonomy that seeks to specify all accounting disclosures? Drawing on literature examining the constitutive potential of classification and formal representation, we use our case study of the digitalisation project undertaken by the global standard-setter, the IASB, to understand how digitalisation intervenes on standard-setting and reporting practice despite the intentions of standard-setters. Our results detail how standard-setters sought to minimise the impact of digitalisation by modelling the taxonomy only on disclosures explicitly required by accounting standards. We reveal the circumstances that led the IASB to change its taxonomy design by seeking to capture not only what should be reported (as prescribed in extant accounting standards) but also what was being reported (as prescribed in a new classification called ‘Common Practices’). We analyse the process by which international accounting disclosure practices were judged to be ‘common’, and demonstrate how the ‘Common Practices’ classification was perceived by early users of the taxonomy. When interpreting the IASB's Common Practices (what is) as disclosure standards (what should be), digitalisation generates a self-validating feedback loop that can generate more homogenous corporate reporting and push International Financial Reporting Standards beyond the principles-based approach they were designed to engender. Although standard-setters became increasingly aware of the influence of the digital (machine-readable) ‘tail’ on the traditional reporting (human-readable) ‘dog’, their attempts to take tighter control of the taxonomy development process strengthened user perceptions that the taxonomy and its ‘Common Practices’ represented an authoritative view of what should be reported. Our results reveal the process by which digital reporting both represents and intervenes in accounting, and how digitalisation impacts key accounting debates. As digitalisation attempts to provide a universal codification of reporting disclosures, it valorises comprehensive machine-friendly disclosure rules over principles, which offer standardised comparability over entity-specific communication. Our study also offers a perspective on the relations between information representation and intervention that moves beyond a study of passive, ‘reactive’ conformance to consider how representations can intervene despite the intentions of those generating the representation. In doing so, we reveal the constitutive potential of digital representations in generating ‘non-passive’ conformance. © 2021 The Authors","Digital reporting; Digitalisation; Digitisation; Financial reporting; Taxonomy; XBRL",,"Rowbottom, N.; Department of Accounting, United Kingdom; email: n.rowbottom@bham.ac.uk",03613682,,,"Account.

In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a two-week, first of its kind experiment that aims to shed light on how different legally trained people interpret and convert Australian Commonwealth legislation into machine-executable code. We find that coders collaboratively agreeing on key legal terms, or atoms, before commencing independent coding work can significantly increase the similarity of their encoded rules. Participants nonetheless made a range of divergent interpretive choices, which we argue are most likely due to: (1) the complexity of statutory interpretation, (2) encoded provisions having varying levels of granularity, and (3) the functionality of our coding language. Based on these findings, we draw an important distinction between processes for technical validation of encoded rules, which focus on ensuring rules adhere to select coding languages and conventions, and processes of legal alignment, which we conceptualise as enhancing congruence between the encoded provisions and the true meaning of the statutory text in line with the modern approach to statutory interpretation. We argue that these processes are distinct but both critically important in enhancing the accuracy of encoded rules. We conclude by emphasising the need in RaC initiatives for multi-disciplinary expertise across specific legal subject matters, statutory interpretation and technical programming. © 2021 ACM.","digitising legislation; legal alignment; machine-executable code; rules as code; statutory interpretation; technical processes","Alignment; Codes (symbols); Coding languages; Copyright legislation; Critical challenges; Executable codes; Most likely; Subject matters; Artificial intelligence",,,9781450385268,,"Proc.

The global financial crisis of 2008 has established the credentials of the Islamic financial system as a sustainable financial system which can save the long run interests of the average citizens around the world while adding value to the real economy. The basic ethical tenets available in the Islamic financial system make it more suited and readymade to fight the economic aftershocks of a pandemic like COVID-19. The basic principles of ethical Islamic finance have solid connections to financial stability and corporate social responsibility within the wide-reaching business context. With the emergence of Financial technology (Fintech) it has provided a missing impetus to the Islamic financial system to compete on equal ground with its conventional counterpart and prove its mettle. The study uses discourse analysis along with the content analysis to extract content and draw a conclusion. The findings of the study indicate that COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for the social and open innovation to grow and finance world have turned to open innovation to provide a speedy, timely, reliable, and sustainable solution to the world.

This has put increasing pressure on banks to monitor and report a range of intricate exposures to comply with new prudential requirements. Regulatory Technology (RegTech) is an emerging technology trend leveraging Information Technology and Digital Innovations that can greatly assist with a bank’s regulatory management process. A consideration is that these technologies can sometimes be expensive and inefficient if deployed on an ad hoc and stand-alone basis. An option is to incorporate RegTech into the digital transformation strategy of a management function such as Treasury. Integrated adoption would mean the digital platform can be deployed to support both strategic management activities and enhanced regulatory processes within Treasury, thereby ensuring commercial and prudential objectives are aligned. RegTech can provide an invaluable tool, in a business-as-usual environment, as well as in real-life stress events, such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak.

As banks based in the Global North have moved to withdraw financial services from many emerging economies, de-risking has attracted attention for undermining financial inclusion and developmental efforts. Novel technologies are being harnessed to address this problem, including applications of blockchain, the digital ledgers of transactions originally underpinning cryptocurrencies.

These studies have demonstrated that newly emerging digital platforms financing early-stage ventures threaten traditional venture capital (VC). We argue that, conversely, VC benefits from advances in information and communication technology (ICT), as ICT fosters entrepreneurship and mitigates agency issues in VC deals. This paper examines the impact of digitization on VC investments from 23 European countries spanning 2007–2019 using a dynamic panel two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique. The results show that the factors “ICT penetration” (a general measure of societal internet and computer access and use) and “digital economy” (a measure of ICT-powered economic activity) exert significant and positive effects on early-stage, later-stage, and total VC investments. Moreover, availability of bank credit moderates the effect of digital economy on VC investment. Finally, this study reveals that it is digital entrepreneurship (as reflected in our “digital economy” measure), and not total entrepreneurial activity, that attracts VC investment. We conclude that the VC industry is aligned with rather than threatened by the newly emerging digital environment. The empirical results are robust to different control variables and data sources.

To facilitate start-ups in financial markets, several regulatory authorities have adopted a new incubation model called a ‘regulatory sandbox’. Regulatory sandboxes enable eligible applicants to test their technology-enabled financial solutions for a certain period of time (subject to conditions the regulator imposes). As such, these instruments allow innovation while preventing severe instability in financial markets caused by systemic risk. Despite their importance, management research has devoted little attention to studying how sandboxes operate as a new incubation model. In our abductive study, we adopt the activity system framework and a qualitative analysis approach to investigate the activities of five leading sandboxes and compare them with the activities of other incubation models. The data analysis yielded an activity model with three design elements (achieving membership, participating and detaching) and one design theme (improving connectedness). Thus, sandboxes are characterized by providing regulatory guidance and facilitating access to testing across international jurisdictions, distinguishing them from both generic and specialized incubation models. Our primary contribution to the incubation literature is extending the knowledge of a unique incubation model through a set of theoretical propositions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Activity system framework; Business accelerators; Business incubators; Financial technology (FinTech); Incubation models; Regulatory sandbox","Commerce; Activity modeling; Activity Systems; Design elements; Management research; Primary contribution; Qualitative analysis; Regulatory authorities; Regulatory guidance; Financial markets","Alaassar, A.; College of Business, Building 80, Melbourne VIC, Australia; email: ahmad.s.m.alaassar@rmit.edu.au",01664972,,TNVTD,"Technovation",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus

This paper also identifies the flaws in the existing regulations and policies on Fintech, and it also proposes an ideal framework for a fintech law as a strategy to strengthen consumer protection and to accelerate the growth of the digital economy in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This is normative research with a legal approach. Data were collected through a literature study and analyzed using legal norm method. Findings: The promising potential and growth of the fintech industry in Indonesia need to be supported by a sound legal framework in the form of Indonesian Law. In regards to fintech, Indonesia does not yet have a specific law on fintech. Existing regulations in the Bank of Indonesia Regulations (PBI) and Indonesia Financial Services Authority Regulations (POJK) only regulate the technical aspects of the industry, thus providing a less sound legal power. Bank of Indonesia (BI) and Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK) have limited authority in the making of regulations and the regulations produced by these institutions cannot stipulate criminal provisions. This results in inadequate consumer protection measures. The Investment Alert Task Force reported 2,018 illegal P2P lending, 472 illegal investment companies and 69 illegal pawnbrokers. The accumulation of online lending transactions in December 2019 reached a total of IDR81.50tn, seeing a 259.56% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the amount of bad debt reached IDR13.6tn, seeing a 169.48% increase. These reasons illustrate how urgently Indonesia needs Fintech Law. Research limitations/implications: This research only examines the existing Fintech regulations in Indonesia. The approach method used is normative legal research. Practical implications: This research is expected to be useful for The House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia (DPR), the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, the Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Bank of Indonesia (BI) in drafting the Fintech Law. Social implications: This research is expected to increase protection for consumers, investors and providers of fintech services and accelerate the growth of the digital economy in Indonesia. Originality/value: Regulating fintech in the Indonesian Law is meant to give legal certainty and better legal protection for consumers, investors and providers of fintech services. Seeing that the value of the Indonesian digital economy in 2019 has reached USD40bn (approximately IDR586tn), Indonesia is philosophically, juridically and sociologically in urgent need of Fintech Law. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business law; Digital economy; Financial technology; Financial technology law; Indonesia; Law and regulation; Law and regulation",,"Kharisma, D.B.; Department of Business Law, Indonesia; email: donabudikharisma@staff.uns.ac.id",1754243X,,,"Int.

With the dual increase of algorithmic trading and the occurrence of “mini-flash crashes” in the market linked to manipulation, this question has become more pressing in recent years. In the past thirty years, the financial markets have undergone a sea change as technological advancements and innovations have fundamentally altered the structure and operation of the markets. Key to this change is the introduction and dominance of trading algorithms. Whereas initial algorithmic trading relied on preset electronic instructions to execute trading strategies, new technology is introducing artificially intelligent (“AI”) trading algorithms that learn dynamically from data and respond intuitively to market changes. These technological developments have exposed significant shortcomings in the effectiveness of anti-manipulation laws, particularly regarding one of their fundamental goals: deterring market manipulation. Preventing manipulation remains a key feature of the legal regime governing the financial markets. Rampant manipulation undermines the viability of the market and, in the case of algorithmic manipulation, increases systemic risks within the market. Deterring algorithmic manipulation is thus essential to the viability and stability of the market. But credible and effective deterrence of wrongdoing requires certainty of punishment, which is increasingly unattainable with respect to algorithmic manipulation under the existing legal regime. Specifically, the law of manipulation tethers liability to scienter, which algorithms cannot legally form. Further, deciphering the intent of the human behind the algorithm can be a near-impossible task in all but the most egregious cases. The scienter-focused nature of the anti-manipulation framework therefore diminishes the disciplinary power of the law, weakening deterrence and incentivizing algorithmic manipulation. This Article demonstrates that the scienter-centric analysis undergirding anti-manipulation laws creates gaps in the detection and punishment of algorithmic manipulation that weaken the current legal regime's deterrent effect. The acute failure of the law to punish algorithmic manipulation incentivizes potential wrongdoers to utilize algorithms to cloak their misdeeds, exposing the markets to significant systemic harm. Notably, unlike other scholars and policymakers that view transparency as the ultimate solution to increase accountability for algorithms, this Article highlights the potential limitations of relying primarily on transparency. Rather, the Article urges changes to the legal framework to modernize its applicability: eschew the scienter requirement and, instead, focus on the resulting harm of the algorithm on the market. Together, these proposals are likely to credibly deter algorithmic manipulation, safeguarding the viability, efficiency, and stability of the markets. © 2021 Vanderbilt Law Review.

However, detailed empirical evidence concerning the impact of various FinTech-level and ecosystem-specific factors as determinants of FinTech success and survival is yet to be discussed. This paper investigates the underlying factors influencing the success of UAE-based FinTech ventures. Several factors are included in the analysis, controlling for the hedonics of the FinTech, including the business model, availability of and access to finance, and business ecosystem framework. Data are pooled using a semi-structured questionnaire conducted with 32 FinTech founders. A qualitative analysis with an ordered logistic regression model was performed. The findings suggest that the availability of resources, in particular through venture capital, is vital to the success and survival of FinTechs as microbusinesses. However, financial barriers, the regulatory environment, and legal issues have a detrimental impact on facilitating the creation and growth of FinTech ventures. Furthermore, the business model dimensions “product/service offering” and “value proposition” tend to influence the success of these ventures. The empirical model’s findings will serve as a data-driven tool to help guide finance policymakers in their decisions on how to promote this new sector. © 2021 by the authors.

However, despite the unprecedented growth of, investment in, and returns generated by this sector, a conducive environment and fintech support ecosystem is essential to exploit the true potential of fintech. The biggest challenge for many governments across the globe is not only setting priorities in which fintech services to invest (e.g., digital wallets, peer-to-peer lending, e-insurances) but also in which geographical area to invest. Since technology is independent of physical interaction and geographical confinement, governments face a dilemma: keep fintech growth geographically diverse or concentrated within a few cities. This study evaluates the fintech success of countries with its spread in different cities and attempts to formulate a policy direction to accelerate the wave of the fourth industrial revolution. Our results suggest that rather than a widespread presence, countries should concentrate their efforts, investment, and attention to developing a fintech ecosystem in fewer cities to facilitate them as much as possible. This concentrated effort could help countries improve their Global Fintech Scores and specialize in specific core areas. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","4ir; Agglomeration; Distribution; Fintech; Geographical concentration; Regulations","Economics; Ecosystems; Industry 4.0; Core area; Digital wallets; Geographical area; Industrial revolutions; Peer-to-peer lending; Physical interactions; True potentials; Fintech; agglomeration; financial services; industrial technology; investment; regulatory approach; technology adoption","Tan, Z.; School of Public affairs, China; email: tzxcqu@126.com",00401625,,,"Technol.

As a result, we examine the impact of financial technologies (FinTechs) on SME efficiency. Using the Generalized Method of Moments methodology and 1,617 SME firms from 22 OECD countries during the period 2011–2018, we find that FinTechs are positively associated with SME efficiency. Interesting results emerge when we incorporate culture. Masculine societies positively moderate the link between FinTechs and SME efficiency. We also find that individualistic and long-term oriented cultures negatively affect the association between FinTechs and SME efficiency. Our findings have multiple implications. This study suggests the need for countries to introduce policies supporting FinTech startups in order to improve SME efficiency. Moreover, if the SME managers aim to achieve higher firm efficiency, then adopting FinTechs may act as a mechanism to attain this objective. Further, it may be important to consider both FinTechs and culture when evaluating cross-border investments. © 2020","Culture; FinTech; Firm efficiency; SMEs","Economics; Fintech; Method of moments; Cross-border; Firm efficiencies; Generalized method of moments; National cultures; OECD countries; Small and medium enterprise; Efficiency; capital flow; efficiency measurement; financial market; financial system; OECD; small and medium-sized enterprise","Abbasi, K.; Department of Management Sciences & Technology, Pakistan; email: kaleemullah.abbasi@bnbwu.edu.pk",00401625,,,"Technol.

Through four original case studies (China, Vietnam, Europe and the United States), we found that the automation of routines by Fintechs, generating economies of both scale and transaction costs, allowed operators (banks, bigtech, telecom, MFIs) to capture this additional value in various forms. Among these, our results suggest that the time freed up from bureaucratic formalities by the institutions’ employees can be reallocated to customer relations and the personalization of the services offered. We conclude that this additional value can contribute to foster, in a paradoxical way, human interactions (and therefore rehumanization) within these business relationships. © 2021 De Boeck Superieur.

National private law systems are to demonstrate sufficient evolutionary strength to cope with digital disruption. Regulatory competition is intended to produce adequate private law solutions if EU regulators bring up the right questions. This paper takes a private law perspective to assess the EU’s strategy and highlight potential shortcomings. Payment services, outsourcing business models, crowd lending, robo-advice and blockchain applications are identified as test cases where the interface between FinTech regulation and private law is most acutely felt. This translates into a re-interpretation of (digital) contractual duties. Traditional liability rules need to evolve, and incoherent concepts under the EU’s digital finance and data protection laws have to be reconciled. Blockchain law is a model case for the far-reaching impact of the interface between FinTech and private law. Member States have to improve the private law status of crypto-assets in order to attract business and address insolvency scenarios. Regulatory sandboxes are addressed as early warning mechanisms, alerting regulators and legislators to risks arising from innovative business models.

These processes have been driven by the market initiatives and lobbying of private financial actors, as well as by the actions of states in seeking to promote economic growth and the interests of the financial firms headquartered on their territories. The general trend has been for states to provide the increasingly globalized architecture for markets, for instance through trade and investment agreements, and then these markets are regulated and stabilized by public and private bodies, often operating globally. Over time, global finance seen has a growth in the importance of the European Union and the global south, including China.

A wide range of play-ers is trying to harness the potential of this transition (including incumbents, start-ups, and so-called BigTechs with extensive customer networks, such as the Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple). In the light of this, regulators and scholars are increas-ingly interested in new regulatory tools to address the challenges brought by technological innovation in the financial sector to consumer welfare and competition. The article contributes to these discussion by shedding light on the regulatory approaches to FinTech emerged so far. Further, the piece focuses on the pro-competitive effect of the access-to-account rule enshrined in the EU Directive 2015/2366 on payment services in the internal market (PSD2). This mechanism represents a very early sector-specific regulatory attempt to nurture competition in the digital economy and effec-tively implement data sharing. In this regard, the on-going UK Open Banking market investigation remedy shows how the antitrust enforcement can be deployed to complement the regulatory toolkit. © 2021, Universidade Catolica Editora.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and particularly its subfield of machine learning (ML) methods have gained immense popularity among the great public and achieved tremendous success in many real-life applications by leading to vast efficiency gains. In the financial trading domain, ML can augment human capabilities in price prediction, dynamic portfolio optimization, and other financial decision-making tasks. However, thanks to constant progress in the ML technology, the prospect of increasingly capable and autonomous agents to delegate operational tasks and even decision-making is now beyond mere imagination, thus opening up the possibility for approximating (truly) autonomous trading agents anytime soon. Given these spectacular developments, this Article argues that such autonomous algorithmic traders may involve significant risks to market integrity, independent from their human experts, thanks to self-learning capabilities offered by state-of-the-art and innovative ML methods. Using the proprietary trading industry as a case study, we explore emerging threats to the application of established market abuse laws in the event of algorithmic market abuse, by taking an interdisciplinary stance between financial regulation, law and economics, and computational finance. Specifically, our analysis focuses on two emerging market abuse risks by autonomous algorithms: market manipulation and “tacit” collusion. We explore their likelihood to arise in global capital markets and evaluate related social harm as forms of market failures. With these new risks in mind, this Article questions the adequacy of existing regulatory frameworks and enforcement mechanisms, as well as current legal rules on the governance of algorithmic trading, to cope with increasingly autonomous and ubiquitous algorithmic trading systems. We demonstrate how the “black box” nature of specific ML-powered algorithmic trading strategies can subvert existing market abuse laws, which are based upon traditional liability concepts and tests (such as “intent” and “causation”). We conclude by addressing the shortcomings of the present legal framework and develop a number of guiding principles to assist legal and policy reform in the spirit of promoting and safeguarding market integrity and safety. © 2021 University of Pennsylvania Law School.

We evaluate a semantic model CSM-ROPA to establish the extent to which it can be used to express a regulator provided accountability tracker to facilitate GDPR/ROPA compliance. We show that the ROPA practices of organisations are largely based on manual paper-based templates or non-interoperable systems, leading to inadequate GDPR/ROPA compliance levels. We contrast these current approaches to GDPR/ROPA compliance with best practice for regulatory compliance and identify four critical features of systems to support accountability. We conduct a case study to analyse the extent that CSM-ROPA, can be used as an interoperable, machine-readable mediation layer to express a regulator supplied ROPA accountability tracker. We demonstrate that CSM-ROPA can successfully express 92% of ROPA accountability terms. The addition of connectable vocabularies brings the expressivity to 98%. We identify three terms for addition to the CSM-ROPA to enable full expressivity. The application of CSM-ROPA provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance. This standardisation would enable the development of automation, and interoperable tools for supported accountability and the demonstration of GDPR compliance.

The aim of the research is to study the role of Fintech firms in the changes in the financial sector landscape, as well dynamics of changes in investments in Fintech by regions and by segments. This study provides empirical evidence on the development of alternative financial services and their role in the development of the financial sector. Based on the research results there is strong evidence about statistically significant difference between investments allocated to Fintech firms by regions and vintage. There have been changes in the regional distribution of investment, with North America (85-90%) dominating in the first years of the decade, and Asia and the Pacific accounting for more than a third and Europe for more than 20% of total investment in recent years.

While software development teams refer to ASVS to secure their applications and development process, they also need to ensure the compliance of various security related regulations, including sector-specific ones. In this work, we study the synergy of these two activities, i.e., by following ASVS, how does a development team position their developed applications in meeting those regulation requirements. We take the highly regulated financial services sector as a case study. In particular, we look at two recent guidelines published by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)-the Technology Risk Management (TRM) guidelines and Notice 655 Cyber Hygiene. We developed a systematic approach to map ASVS to those two sector-specific regulations. Our results show that by adopting ASVS, a development team can achieve a high degree of regulatory compliance (38.6 % for the MAS TRM guidelines and 47.6% for the MAS Notice 655, respectively). That demonstrates the viability of using international standards (like ASVS) to support compliance with the two sector-specific regulations. In addition, our mapping approach can be useful for organizations to support their compliance efforts. © 2021 IEEE.","application security; compliance; financial service; verification standard","Application programs; Compliance control; Cybersecurity; Finance; Risk management; Software design; Application security; Case-studies; Compliance; Development teams; Financial service; Financial services sector; Regulation compliance; Security verification; Singapore; Verification standards; Regulatory compliance",,,9781665426039,,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

The book introduces non-finance scholars into the wider debate regarding the conduct and regulation of finance to encourage broader discussion on important societal issues that relate to finance. The book also explores the ineffectiveness of the current approach to global prudential governance and places this discussion within the more expansive context of global governance and nationalism in the twenty-first century. The book argues that fragmentation and the growing trend of promoting informality and voluntarism has facilitated a return to nationalism as a primary form of global governance that acts contrary to post-crisis reforms that seek to promote stability and sustainability in the conduct of finance. As a remedy, Kourabas suggests that we need more, not less, of what we have traditionally conceived as international law – treaties and treaty-based international organisations. In the field of finance, this means not only pursuing financial liberalisation through free trade and investment treaties, but also the inclusion of provisions in these treaties that promotes systemic financial stability and sustainable development objectives. Of interest to legal and non-legal academics and students, legal professionals and policy-makers, this book offers a nuanced defence of international law as an approach to global governance in finance and beyond, as well as reform of international law to meet the needs of twenty-first century society. © 2022 Steve Kourabas.",,,"Kourabas, S.; Centre for Commercial Law and Regulatory Studies, Australia",,9781000450958; 9780429329708,,"Global Finance in the 21st Century: Stability and Sustainability in a Fragmenting World",Book,"Final","",Scopus

This paper reviews the literature to identify possible benefits or challenges that fintech firms can have for the traditional banking system. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a review of published research papers related to fintech and digital finance. The Scopus database, SSRN database and google scholar were used to find relevant research papers. The final sample included impactful papers about the effect of fintech activities on the banking and financial services industry. Findings: The current paper indicated that while fintech firms would take some market share away from banks, it is not expected that fintech firms would substitute banks. However, banks are required to accelerate their adoption of innovations and advanced technology to compete with fintech firms. It is also proposed that strategic partnerships and cooperation could happen between banks and fintech companies in a way that benefits both sides. Originality/value: The present paper adds to the understanding of the effect of the fintech firms’ growth on the banking industry in light of the emerging opportunities and threats for the financial sector. The paper also provides guidance for fruitful research on the impact of fintech activities on social and economic welfare in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bank performance; Banking competition; COVID-19 pandemic; Crowdfunding; Digital payment; Fintech; Peer-to-peer lending; Strategic partnerships",,"Elsaid, H.M.; Faculty of Commerce – Accounting Department, Egypt; email: hm_elsaid@hotmail.com",17554179,,,"Qual.

Such changes are due, in particular, to the concentration and scaling up and diversification of the structure of financial services, the renewal of the financial sector on the basis of FinTech operations and blockchain technologies. This requires taking into account the impact of innovation factors on the transformation of the financial market in the dimension of FinTech. The study aims to identify the imperatives of global financial innovation and show ways to develop innovative models in the interpretation of S-curves for next-generation products using new technologies when key technologies on the previous S-curve become obsolete. Also, the matrix of financial innovations is presented and the synergy of its innovation models is proved. The results of the study are to prove that each of the presented models is not independent, it evolves and develops itself, as well as affects other models. This made it possible to identify prognostic pathways for the development of innovative models in their synergy in the form of two-ring motion. Thus, the study emphasizes the need for further research aimed at developing innovative models that will determine strategic decisions in the formation of innovation imperatives. © 2021 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

A well-structured outsourcing arrangement can go a long way towards enhancing long term organizational strategic growth. In the post-2014 FinTech era, (i) strategic management with an innovation focus and (ii) financial technology-associated risks, have brought about changes to outsourcing in the financial services industry. Presently, most outsourcing life cycle models in existing literature seek to provide comprehensive, yet industry-neutral guidelines lacking industry context and depth of coverage. A newly licensed financial institution deciding to embark on outsourcing but is uncertain about how to thread the increasingly complex FinTech and financial regulatory landscape, will likely find domain-specific outsourcing life cycle models useful. A more targeted financial services outsourcing life cycle approach, with a focus on strategy and risk management in today’s context, can contribute more effectively to the application and review of outsourcing implementation. This research contributes to present literature by proposing a new Strategy-Risk outsourcing life cycle model. This is an elegant and simple-to-use end-to-end framework which can be utilized by the financial services industry to guide outsourcing decisions.

We propose the time-varying comparative mean value as a statistical method that learns about the dynamics governing how the response of a reference subject differs from that of a comparison group, defined via covariate truncation. The proposed model can be regarded as a time-varying truncated covariate regression model of which a smooth version is devised by resorting to local polynomial regression. The simulation study suggests that our estimators accurately recover the true time-varying comparative mean value in a variety of scenarios. We showcase our methods using OB-type data from a financial service provider in the UK, with the dataset containing detailed information on customers’ accounts across 70 UK financial institutions. By contrasting a specific customer against similar customers, our method offers interesting diagnostics that can be used by financial institutions to recommend personalised services. © 2021 The Author(s).

The role of the national drive has contributed to economic diversification and financial thrive. Bahrain considers itself a getaway to the entire world due to its strategic location and ideal environment that attracts many startups and business entities. Recently, the government of Bahrain exhibits an outstanding potential in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and started to tap into the digital transformation era due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4th IR). To be aligned with the Bahrain Economic Vision 2030, the financial sector regulated by the Bahrain Central Bank (CBB) implemented several financial solutions based on innovation in technology to increase the customer experience and satisfaction which ultimately brings economic fruitful results. Moreover, Bahrain becomes the second world hub for Islamic Finance services after Malaysia with more than 25 Islamic Finance organizations. Furthermore, it undertakes major milestone to adapt the concept of artificial intelligence in the financial and banking sector and has created a competitive regional presence in Financial Technology (FinTech). This research aims to briefly define the notion of artificial intelligence (AI) and highlight Bahrain’s achievements in the same field during the Fourth Industrial Revolution and how the artificial intelligence contributes to a rapid development even though it is still in its early phases. Beside this, the research presents the women empowerment in Bahrain and their active participation in all arenas particularly in the financial sector with exceptional lead in innovation. One of the advanced technologies arises in Bahrain is the (Fintech) which promotes the financial services to a superior level. Therefore, artificial intelligence investments require certain set of knowledge and skills to be obtained by the workforce that led to excellent conclusions.

Research purpose: Based on the interaction between technology change, the industry as a whole and the perceptions of individuals within organisations, this study explored how South African life insurance companies view the 4IR and how they are responding to the changes prompted by it. Motivation for study: This study sought to establish a baseline for practitioners in the life insurance industry to navigate the 4IR more effectively and for researchers to undertake further inquiry into specific enablers and inhibitors of technology transformation. Research approach/design and method: The study took an exploratory, qualitative approach. Interviews were conducted with 12 organisational leaders, purposively selected from a range of large, medium and start-up life insurers in South Africa. A thematic analysis method was used to analyse the data. Main findings: Four key themes related to organisational change and resistance to change within the industry were found: lack of urgency; lack of agility; partnerships and ecosystems; and abilities of people and leaders. Practical/managerial implications: Managers should recognise the urgency for proactive change, encourage collaborative practices by leveraging ecosystems and forming partnerships and ensure lifelong learning of employees. Contribution/value-add: There is a paucity of empirical work on managerial perceptions of the 4IR and the readiness for change within the life insurance industry. This study contributes to this debate and provided insights on organisational views at a management level. © 2021.

In this contribution, we have distinguished three types of RegTech based on the party taking the initiative for its development: (i) Compliance RegTech, where financial institutions develop or acquire RegTech tools to facilitate compliance; (ii) Supervisory RegTech, where a supervisor imposes the use of a certain RegTech tool to facilitate compliance, supervision and/or enforcement; and (iii) Regulatory RegTech, where the regulator provides machine-readable and/or machine-executable regulation. This approach allows for a nuanced analysis of the benefits and challenges of RegTech, and of the changing role of supervisors in a RegTech era. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,"Colaert, V.; KU Leuven UniversityBelgium",,9781000364644; 9780367344146,,"Routledge Handb. of Financial Technology and Law",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus

HFT activity poses a risk to the overarching regulatory objective of maintaining orderly trading conditions, because of its propensity to contribute to episodes of excessive volatility and flight of liquidity, popularly referred to as ‘flash crashes’. Such incidents could propagate and cause wider market turbulence and may - in worst case scenarios - become systemic. European legislators have responded to this risk by instituting regulation targeting HFT in MiFID II. This chapter identifies different characteristics of HFT activities that may challenge the efficacy of the European regulatory efforts. First, a lack of conceptual clarity and insight into HFT operations hampers the efforts of regulators to assess an appropriate level of regulation and to design effective rules. Furthermore, regulatory objectives are conflicting with each other, in particular the objectives of market efficiency and financial stability, which requires balancing them in this regulatory context. Moreover, novel traits of market structure and market functionality, including complexity, extreme velocity, cross-market connectivity and costly technology, challenge the ability of regulators and supervisors to uphold orderly HFT markets. Potential incentive problems might make any participation of market actors in designing relevant regulatory responses problematic. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Iris H-Y Chiu and Gudula Deipenbrock; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,"Myklebust, T.; University of OsloNorway",,9781000364644; 9780367344146,,"Routledge Handb. of Financial Technology and Law",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus

It argues that fintech is a fundamentally systemic regulatory challenge, a macro-level force disrupting the currently dominant technocratic paradigm of modern financial regulation. The chapter discusses the inherent inability of the existing technocratic regulatory model to accommodate these systemic changes and outlines the core changes in the underlying philosophy of financial regulation necessary in order to meet the fintech challenge. A sustained inquiry into the systemic meaning and impact of fintech as a regulatory phenomenon must start with an analysis of the defining features of the current system of financial regulation.

Besides systemic risk affecting fintechs, in particular, fintechs’ ability to contribute to systemic risk is explored. Based on the respective findings, the adequateness of different regulatory responses is considered, including general regulation of all fintech companies as well as special regulation reserved for fintechs considered systemically important. To distinguish these systemically important fintechs (SIFTs) from other fintechs, and for the purpose of measuring (levels of) systemic importance, indicator-based approaches seem preferable for now.

This paper aims to critically evaluate the effectiveness of the crypto-asset regulation in the UK and the consistency of the existing regulatory scheme. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts comparative methods to carry out the analysis. The paper begins by elaborating the development of crypto-assets alongside the financial innovation in the world and pinpointing the core Acts and Regulations applied to crypto-assets in the UK. The paper also discusses a court case in the EU to highlight an argument among legal professions concerning crypto-assets classification. Findings: Through carefully analysing relevant primary and secondary legislation of the UK and EU, this paper identifies some unclarified issues in the regulatory framework and discovers three flaws in the regulatory system. The paper concludes that the effectiveness of the current regulatory scheme is poor and room for improvement exists. Originality/value: The paper provides the first review and a thorough analysis of the Laws and Acts applied to the crypto-asset regulation in the UK. It also calls on a simpler and clearer regulatory scheme from the perspectives of market participants and consumers.

A review of GDPR compliance software solutions shows that organisations are being greatly challenged in meeting compliance obligations as set out under the GDPR, despite the myriad of software tools available to them. Many organisations continue to take a manual and informal approach to GDPR compliance. Our analysis shows significant gaps on the part of GDPR tools in their ability to demonstrate compliance in that they lack interoperability features, and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility.

Many financial institutions are struggling with ever-changing regulatory requirements and the increased burden of intricate rules. Such rules can be conflicting, and subjected to local implementation and jurisdictic interpretation. Non-compliance or the inability to meet the deadlines subject institutions to hefty penalties and multimillion-dollar fines for failures in controlling nefarious and over-the-counter trading activities. In this chapter, we map out ongoing regulatory milestones globally to understand the main supervisory priorities by territory and propose how financial institutions can successfully administer regulatory change through an AI-driven regulatory management model within their organizations. We discuss the evolution, challenges and recommendations for financial institutions (including Shariah compliance) in the change management for regulations using a structured approach that addresses regional priorities. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-money laundering; Customer due diligence; Data privacy and protection; OTC reform",,"Mohamed, H.; Stellar Consulting GroupSingapore; email: hazik@stellarcg.com",1860949X,,,"Stud.

Fintech is growing by leaps and bounds in the current financial services through banks and Fintech companies. It provides solution for the businesses in controlling their operational costs in their business activities. Startup businesses use “Fintech” as platform to run their businesses operations with minimum cost [25]. The startup wave has obsessed the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and when it is digital startups, the fintech is closely reaching 12% of all transactions in the region followed by e-commerce [9]. The MENA region governments and apex bodies are encouraging fintech industries to develop their businesses along with IT innovation to establish a sound financial ecosystem. As said by COO of Jordan’s Arab Bank, this industry is at an earlier stage which requires lots of rules and policies to regulate this industry with the support of banks and fintech industries. It is the crucial task for the regulators to establish technology based steady financial system which requires well established stringent rules and regulations to prevent cyber-crimes. Hence, this conceptual work attempts to understand the main aspects of Fintech, role of financial institutions, attitude of stakeholders towards the new financial system, challenges and opportunities prevailing towards this industry. This has been achieved by reviewing the existing literature to support the growth of the economy in MENA region using Fintech. The outcome of the study indicates that the sustainability, infrastructure, human resources and government supports are the main pillars of the growth of fintech in MENA region. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Economy; Fintech; MENA",,"Madbouly, A.; Business and Accounting Department, Oman; email: araby@muscatcollege.edu.om",1860949X,,,"Stud.

From one side this process generates more possibilities for consumers from other side it is related with new risks which arise in banking sector. At the beginning of FinTech era lots of analyst were discussing about disruptive potential in financial services. Later, however, we can see more discussions about cooperation between FinTech companies and banks. The other point which is very important to discuss about is a financial inclusion. The purpose of this study is to analyze the interaction between banking sector and FinTech companies. We use a case study of Lithuania because here FinTech sector is growing very intensively. First of all we try to analyze the scientific literature which analyzes the main aspects of FinTech sector. The second part of the article provides the progress of the FinTech sector and presents the main points of methodology. The research of the FinTech sector in Lithuania was focused on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and political, economic, social, technological, environmental, legal (PESTEL) analysis and main statistical parameters. We also used a correlation and regression analysis together with qualitative assessments. Our results showed that in order to value the interaction between banking and financial technology better to focus on qualitative assessment because only statistical analysis can give different and wrong results.

Most of the time, the EU suggests recurring to light-tough disclosure duties. Hence, the European model falls short in rebalancing information asymmetry and unequal bargaining power plaguing the SMEs. In practice, the EU model consists either in pure delegation of self-regulatory powers (codes of conduct) or non-enforceable co-regulatory schemes (with technical standards established by the platforms themselves). Other models have been suggested that rely on the regulator's access to the platform's data (so called savvy and data-delegated options). These governance models present several limitations, making the platforms' role as regulatory intermediators little credible. In this scenario, the paper purports that a third option should be considered. In particular, to tackle the multifaceted risks associated with algorithmic decisions by digital platforms, while at the same time avoiding stifling innovation, it makes three suggestions: (1) also information disclosures should be done by an algorithm; (2) that is pre-tested in a co-regulatory process, that involves the regulator and stakeholders; and (3) enforced through legal and other empowerment tools, rather than sole fines. © 2020 The Author(s).

We use the annotated dataset to train deep learning models, specifically recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks combined with state-of-the-art BERT transformers. Experimental results show that the deep learning models can accurately identify FinTech innovations.

The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of fintech (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. These initiatives are developing rapidly, driven in part by the sharing economy, regulations, and information technology. However, research in the field of fintech remains in its infancy. Fintech offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. This provides an opportunity to more closely examine fintech’s research challenges and trends. This study aims to (1) determine the state of the art of financial technology research; (2) identify gaps in the financial technology research field; and (3) identify challenges and trends for future research potential.

It is a repository of rules written in LegalRuleML, an XML formalism designed to be a standard for representing the semantic and logical content of legal documents. The rules represent the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the new Regulation that is significantly affecting the digital market in the European Union and beyond. The DAPRECO knowledge base builds upon the Privacy Ontology (PrOnto) (Palmirani et al in Proceedings of the 7th international conference on electronic government and the information systems perspective: technology-enabled innovation for democracy, government and governance, 2018c), which provides a model for the legal concepts involved in the GDPR, by adding a further layer of constraints in the form of if-then rules, referring either to standard first order logic implications or to deontic statements. If-then rules are formalized in reified Input/Output logic (Robaldo and Sun in J Log Comput 7, 2017) and then codified in LegalRuleML. Reified Input/Output logic is an application of standard Input/Output logic for legal reasoning, in which Input/Output logic is combined with the reification-based approach in Hobbs and Gordon (A formal theory of commonsense psychology, how people think people think. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2017). The DAPRECO knowledge base is then a case study for reified Input/Output logic, and it shows that the formalism indeed appears to be a good candidate to effectively formalize, via uniform and simple (flat) representations, complex linguistic/deontic phenomena that may be found in legal texts.

Although many experts believe that in the confrontation between banks and fintech companies, banks are surrendering their competitive positions in the financial market to fintech companies, the article provides facts proving the opposite. The purpose of the study is to assess the competitive position of banks in comparison with fintech companies. The study used a systematic approach, comparative analysis, expert estimates, logical analysis. The article recognizes the fact that there are new competitors in the financial market. However, fintech companies are ahead of banks exclusively in technology, expanding the delivery channels of banking products to customers. The product line of banks is much larger than that of fintech companies. Banks, with the skills and experience of a highly professional banking business, have begun digital transformation. Today banks are transferring their business to new modern technologies. Banking leaders are becoming leaders among all financial market players. This is especially noticeable in Russia, where the largest bank, the Savings Bank of Russia, has officially announced a change in its business model. The Sber ecosystem, he created, marked the beginning of the transition to the next stage in the development of the fintech area. Summarizing the results of the study, the authors of this article proved that universal banks remain the leaders in the Russian financial market both in terms of product line and digital technologies, Russian banks began to develop the non-banking services sector and create integrated ecosystems.

Because they are new, there is a lack of research on regulatory sandboxes; most studies have investigated legal aspects while overlooking the management perspective. To address this gap, this paper builds on incubation research studies to explore how social interactions within regulatory sandboxes influence the practices of regulators and regulatees, using social capital theory. An exploratory-abductive approach is adopted, using data collected from 16 semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that regulator-regulatee social interactions increase the legitimacy, risk management capabilities, and knowledge of regulatory frameworks among regulatees and, as to regulators, increase their understanding of regulatory constraints and potential risks in enabling technologies, better inform them of regulatees’ support needs, and offer them early access to regulatory innovations. The findings also reveal that the practices of regulators and regulatees may be negatively affected due to lowered trust and discrepancies in expectations and underlying goals.

During economic slowdowns, corporate default may spread like a virus and lead to large-scale defaults or even systemic financial crises. To help financial regulatory authorities and banks manage the risk associated with networked loans, we identified the default contagion risk, a pivotal issue in developing preventive measures, and established iConViz, an interactive visual analysis tool that facilitates the closed-loop analysis process. A novel financial metric, the contagion effect, was formulated to quantify the infectious consequences of guarantee chains in this type of network.

To track this new sector garnering investor attention, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and Nasdaq, came up with KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index (KFTX) on July 18, 2016 comprising of 49 constituents. The objective of this paper is to compare KFTX performance with the leading market indices, including S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The data is collected for a period of 12 months, 24 months and 34 months starting from July 18, 2016. The findings of the analysis suggest that the returns for KFTX are consistently higher for 12 months, 24 months and 34 months over S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. The cross section analysis of the 48 KFTX index constituents sub-classified into eight categories representing several different financial industry groups and businesses indicate that for the 34 months period networks and payments gave returns of 82.1% and 71.6% whereas asset management business gave an average negative return of - 51.0% and the specialty marketplace lenders gave a return of 26.6%. This indicates a significant non-uniform growth within the FinTech industry. The findings motivate for an in-depth analysis of the various industry groups and businesses within the FinTech industry and to explore further the reasons and attributes which differentiate these sectors. The study has implications for policy makers, asset management companies and investors in terms of understanding and framing policies for FinTech investments. © 2020","FinTech; index return; KFTX",,"Kadam, S.; H1105, Udyognagar, Chinchwadgao, India; email: sureshkadam@gmail.com",19234023,,,"Int.

This study combines these two research streams to analyze the decision-making criteria for funding financial technology companies (fintechs), hybrid companies that combine digital entrepreneurship, technology, and banking. The study first uses prior literature to derive important characteristics to define fintechs and then uses 12 expert interviews to elaborate on decision-making criteria in funding. Except for smaller peculiarities, fintech funding does not appear to differ from that of other digital entrepreneurship in different markets, and—as with most digital business models—scalability was identified as a key criterion. Additionally, by serving as a major provider of money for young companies, banks have changed their role and positioning in funding new financial technology entrepreneurs. Through developments in digital technology, banks have shifted from traditional money-lending activities (i.e., debt-financing) to becoming stakeholders in fintechs and, hence, equity investors. We also describe how these formerly distinct fields have converged due to regulatory requirements, digital newcomers, and a need for constant innovation, with their future sustainable development dependent on sharing and collaboration. © 2020 by the authors.

We consider the whole distribution: the left tail (bearish case), the right tail (bullish case) and the center of the distribution and construct three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center) and obtain network-based spillover indicators. We find that linkages in the network are stronger in the bearish case when the risk of spillover is higher. FinTech institutions' risk spillover to financial institutions positively correlates with financial institutions' increase in systemic risk.

They act as a safe haven for deposits and are major sources of credit for households and small- and medium-sized firms. A not-for-profit orientation (in many cases) and a focus on maximising benefits to members have ensured the enduring popularity and sustainability of financial cooperatives. This is particularly evident since the global financial crisis when financial cooperatives continued to extend credit to members as many profit-orientated commercial banks restricted credit to households and firms. The overarching theme of the first part of this review is the structural and behavioural characteristics of financial cooperatives. In this part we consider, the origin and diffusion of financial cooperatives, network arrangements, the business model, relationship banking, balancing the interest of members, tax treatment and regulatory framework. The second part has performance and contribution to the real economy as the overarching theme. In this part we consider, efficiency and sustainability, mergers, acquisitions and failures, the benefits (and challenges) of FinTech and the contribution of financial cooperatives to the real economy including during times of crisis.

However, regulation of these new services faces a double challenge: to keep pace with innovation and facilitate new market entries while at the same time understanding and managing the regulatory risks that are involved. At this stage, the existing EU regulatory framework is of little help: the bulk of the present body of financial regulation stems from a different time, with different regulatory problems in mind. EU regulation is also very slow to change and to adapt. Therefore, this paper proposes a regulatory ""sandbox""- an experimentation space - as a step towards a regulatory environment where such new business models can thrive. A sandbox would allow market participants to test fintech services in the real market, with real consumers, but under the close scrutiny of the supervisor. The benefit of such an approach is that it fuels the development of new business practices and reduces the ""time to market""cycle of financial innovation, while simultaneously safeguarding consumer protection. At the same time, a sandbox allows for mutual learning in a technical field which is sometimes poorly understood, both for firms and for the regulator. This would help to reduce the prevalent regulatory uncertainty for all market participants. In the particular EU legal framework with various layers of legal instruments, the implementation of such a sandbox is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a ""guided sandbox"", operated by the EU Member States, but with endorsement, support, and monitoring by EU institutions. This innovative approach would be somewhat uncharted territory for the EU, and thereby also contribute to the future development of EU financial market governance as a whole. © The Author(s), 2020.",,,"Ringe, W.-G.; University of Hamburg, Germany; email: georg.ringe@uni-hamburg.de",1867299X,,,"Eur.

In banking, the first applications of AI were successful; however, AI is mainly applied in investment banking and backend services without customer contact. AI in commercial banking with its focus on customer interaction has received little attention so far. Introducing AI in commercial banking could change business processes and interactions with customers, which could create research opportunities for behavioral finance. Based on this research gap, we conducted a structured literature review to identify applications of AI in commercial banks and the challenges of implementing AI. Our findings suggest that by using AI, commercial banks can reduce losses in lending, increase security in processing payments, automate compliance-related work, and improve customer targeting.

In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed.

Our knowledge of how to develop and manage the digital platforms that make P2P lending possible, however, is limited. Through an in-depth examination of the strategies deployed and actions taken across the various stages of development of Tuodao, one of the most successful online P2P lending platforms in China, the purpose of this study is to develop a process model of P2P Lending Platform Development to address this knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach: The case research method was adopted for this research, and a total of 16 informants were interviewed. The informants were composed of representatives of Tuodao’stop management, organizational IT functions as well as its various business units. Findings: Our study reveals that the development of a P2P lending platform can unfold in a specific sequence across three stages, and the development of a particular side of the platform should be emphasized in each stage (i.e. Partners, followed by Lenders, and then Borrowers). Each stage is also distinctive in terms of their strategies and platform configuration outcomes, which are elaborated on in our paper. Originality/value: Our process model contributes an in-depth view of how P2P lending platforms should be established and nurtured to complement the existing studies in this rapidly growing research area. In addition, our study also hints at the strategies that can facilitate the various stages. Our model can potentially serve as the foundation for formulating guidelines for the managers of P2P lending platforms, so that they are able to optimize the development of their platforms and extend the benefits of P2P lending to a broader base of customers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study; China; FinTech; P2P lending; Platform development; Process model",,"Sun, Y.; School of Business Administration, China; email: zorrnsun@163.com

As solution providers, KIBS firms need to invest competencies that supports their capacity to solve customers' problems. We examine how KIBS firms address this challenge by investigating how solution-provision competence (SPC), as a firm-level competence, contributes to the delivery of effective solutions, and how and when KIBS firms leverage SPC to transform knowledge gained from various search paths into effective solutions for customers. The results show that distal search enriches knowledge diversity, which helps foster solution-provision competence but only up to a point, after which the relationship turns negative, with distal search showing a diminishing effect on solution-provision competence. In addressing the diminishing returns of distal search to solution-provision competence, we show that higher levels of proximal search and strategic flexibility reverse the diminishing effect of high levels of distal search on solution-provision competence; however, employee collaboration did not help counter the diminishing returns (e.g., marginal benefits). Finally, we demonstrate that solution-provision competence helps KIBS firms offer effective solutions tailored to business customers' specific needs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Employee collaboration; Knowledge search; Knowledge-intensive business services; Solution competence; Strategic flexibility",,"O'Cass, A.; Department of Marketing, Australia; email: aron.ocass@mq.edu.au",00198501,,IMMAD,"Ind.

It offers a five-part taxonomy of (i) the key fintech-driven changes in the structure and operation of today's financial system, and (ii) the corresponding challenges these systemic shifts pose to the continuing efficacy of the regulatory enterprise as it exists today. This exercise reveals the fundamental tension at the core of the fintech problem. In the fintech era, the financial system as a whole is growing ever bigger, moving ever faster, and getting ever more complex and difficult to manage. The emerging regulatory responses to these macro-level changes, however, continue to operate primarily on the micro-level. Surveying the presently fragmented efforts to regulate fintech, this article highlights the limiting effects of the technocratic bias built into their design. Against that background, it outlines several alternative reform options that would explicitly target the core macro-structural, as opposed to micro-transactional, aspects of the fintech challenge- A nd do so in a more assertive, comprehensive, and normatively unified manner. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. The first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-KYC systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems. The third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments. The fourth pillar—design of digital financial markets and systems—supports broader access to finance and investment. Implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through FinTech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development. © 2020, T.M.C.

The paper summarizes the research and findings in this emerging field. Thereafter, it identifies the gaps and provides directions for further research. Simultaneously, the paper collates technical terms related to FinTech that appear repeatedly in each category and explains them. Finally, the study highlights the lessons that growing FinTech firms and their regulators can learn from the experiences of their counterparts across the globe. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature consisting of 130 studies (social science research network [SSRN]-29 papers, Scopus-81, other sources-20) on FinTech is carried out in this thematic paper. Findings: This thematic paper divides FinTech into three themes, i.e. financial industry, innovation/technology and law/regulation. The paper suggests that a thorough impact of FinTech on various stakeholders can be understood using three dimensions, namely, consumers, market players and regulatory front. It is noted that FinTech is in its nascent phase and is undergoing continuous development and implementation through product and process innovation, disruption and transformation. Research limitations/implications: The paper reports that FinTech promises huge potential for further study by various stakeholders in the FinTech industry – from academia to practitioners to regulators. Practical implications: The paper summarizes lessons that could be of significance for FinTech users, producers, entrepreneurs, investors, policy designers and regulators. Originality/value: The paper is believed to add value to the understanding of FinTech in light of the emerging threats and opportunities for its various stakeholders. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data; Blockchain; Crowdfunding; Cryptocurrency; Entrepreneurial finance; FinTech; ICOs; Innovation; P2P lending; Regtech; Regulatory sandbox; Shadow banking",,"Sangwan, V.; Department of Industrial and Management Engineering, India; email: vikassangwaniitk@gmail.com",10867376,,,"Stud.

New technologies for advertising, contracting, and transacting have proliferated, and so have fierce policy debates on issues such as identity theft and online privacy; arbitration clauses and class action lawsuits; and Americans' accumulation of debt and the unsavory practices sometimes used by collectors of it. Facing these realities, scholars, policymakers, and advocates have devoted increasing energy to this area of law. Despite its prominence, confusion persists regarding what consumer protection really is or does. Though much discussed, it remains undertheorized. In particular, analysis of consumer law and policy has not sufficiently taken account of the implications of social and technological change. This Article constructs a new model of the consumer protection ecosystem by contextualizing purely legal constraints amid the other realities of commercial relationships. Drawing on scholarship in the areas of technology, social change, and law, the model lays out three basic types of constraints on the activities of participants in consumer commercial transactions: legal, technical, and social. This model provides a basis for exploring how those constraints interact and shape behavior. The model has significant ramifications for scholars, policymakers, and advocates. It underscores why the area of consumer commerce defies one-size-fits-all solutions: good policies require not only consideration of consumers, merchants, and the commercial relationships they pursue, but of the dynamic social and technological contexts of those relationships. For instance, when technology opens unexpected new areas of feasible conduct, both law and social norms may lag behind in their ability to constrain its socially undesirable aspects. Focused, public deliberation and increased regulatory attention may be merited at least until social norms have developed to define the acceptable contours of such conduct. This Article provides a more refined and inclusive framework for future research and debate. © 2020 Denver University Law Review.

This paper examines the salient role of mobile payments in traditional banks' drive toward financial accessibility in sub-Sahara Africa by using panel econometric approaches that consider the issues of independencies among cross-sectional residuals. Using data from the World Development Index (WDI) 2011-2017 on 11 countries in the region, empirical results from cross-sectional dependence (CD) tests, panel unit root test, panel cointegration test, and the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) approach indicates that (i) the panel time series data are cross-sectionally independent, (ii) the variables have the same order of integration and are cointegrated, and (iii) growth in mobile payment transactions had a significant positive relationship with formal account ownership, the number of ATMs, and number of new bank branches in the long-run. The paper therefore confirms that the institutional structure of traditional banks that makes them competitive, irrespective of emerging disruptive technologies, has stimulated overall financial accessibility in the region leading to overall sustainable growth in the financial sector.

The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the growth of P2P lending on the growth of bank lending for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and Non-MSME debtors. Separating the scale of the debtor is important, given the initial process of disruptive innovation of reaching areas that are not the incumbent’s main target. The examination was conducted in this study using panel data regression, whereby the examination was done in stages. This was an overall examination without differentiating between the regions, further examination conducted with more detail by separating between the loans inside and outside Java Island. This is because the economic structure in Indonesia is still dominated by the regions in Java, but FinTech is generally able to grow in areas with less developed local economies. The result of this study is consistent overall, Java and outside Java Island, as shows that the growth in P2P lending in Indonesia does not have a significant impact on the growth of bank loans for Non-MSME lending. However, it does have a negative impact on the growth of bank loans for MSME lending. This is in line with the entrant’s disruptive trajectory process by which the entrants enter the competition through an underserved market (niche markets) and not through the main target market of the incumbent (MSME).

The dynamic features of financial markets and the innovation of complex financial products and services based on new technologies and business models have presented regulators with significant challenges. Specifically, how can regulators effectively scrutinise unprecedentedly large volumes of market data? Is ‘Regtech’, instruments developed by industry to assist regulators, able to strengthen private compliance with public regulation? Does an alternative approach which institutionalises public–private cooperation offer answers to these new regulatory challenges? Responding to these questions, we adopt an analytic approach that categorises innovations by the type of regulatory uncertainty they produce. Our findings indicate that different types of uncertainty are driving divergent responses at the national and European levels, leading to a mixture of regulatory trajectories: cooperation and competition, centralisation and fragmentation. © Adrienne Héritier and Magnus G.

Improving the quality of financial regulation will require deeper cooperation between regulators of leading economies and a proactive position of the financial industry, as well as the decentralization of financial regulation. However, it is unlikely that this will happen at the global level. Financial stability became a key goal of global financial regulation in the post-crisis period. We consider financial stability as the “tragedy of commons.” The article describes the main trends of financial markets regulation after the crisis: transformation of global financial architecture, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing practices (AML/ CT), financial sanctions. The article analyzes the existing failures of modern post-crisis financial regulation: credit crunch, reduction in the effectiveness of monetary policy, regulatory arbitrage, and increased compliance costs (AML/CT legislation, tax legislation, and the sanctions regime). In the future we expect simultaneous trends of harmonization and standardization of requirements in traditional sectors of financial markets (including traditional institutions of the shadow banking sector), but at the same time regulatory arbitrage will induce new financial technologies in order to reduce regulatory costs. The crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 despite its non-financial nature will almost inevitably have a major impact on financial markets and their regulation. Possible steps to eliminate failures in the financial regulation system are proposed, including recommendations for international organizations. © 2020.

Modern asset management draws on a wide-range of fields beyond financial theory: economics, financial accounting, econometrics/statistics, management science, operations research (optimization and Monte Carlo simulation), and more recently, data science (Big Data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence). The challenge in writing an institutional asset management book is that when tools from these different fields are applied in an investment strategy or an analytical framework for valuing securities, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the fundamentals of these fields. Attempting to explain strategies and analytical concepts while also providing a primer on the tools from other fields is not the most effective way of describing the asset management process. Moreover, while an increasing number of investment models have been proposed in the asset management literature, there are challenges and issues in implementing these models. This book provides a description of the tools used in asset management as well as a more in-depth explanation of specialized topics and issues covered in the companion book, Fundamentals of Institutional Asset Management. The topics covered include the asset management business and its challenges, the basics of financial accounting, securitization technology, analytical tools (financial econometrics, Monte Carlo simulation, optimization models, and machine learning), alternative risk measures for asset allocation, securities finance, implementing quantitative research, quantitative equity strategies, transaction costs, multifactor models applied to equity and bond portfolio management, and backtesting methodologies.

However, environmental agencies have started using AI in the fight against environmental crime, thus enhancing regulatory effectiveness. For businesses, this implies being subjected to a greater scrutiny by the authorities. Hence, the adoption of AI tools could help address the corporate need for developing compliance strategies to cope with environmental regulations and to avoid the imposition of punitive sanctions. This article discusses the good and the bad of using AI to improve corporate criminal compliance in the environmental area. Starting from the consideration that, also in this field, the automation makes it more difficult to allocate corporate criminal liability, the contribution highlights how other legal concerns, such as those related to privacy and corporate surveillance on employees, appear less relevant, suggesting that this could be a significant area for further research. © 2020 Editions Eres.

The concept of Regulatory Technology, or RegTech, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is still in the infant stage due to lack of defined processes and it holds immense potential in employing RegTech to its existing institutions. The purpose of this paper is to understand the various factors that determine the adoption for RegTech services and proposes a multi-criteria decision-making approach by ranking those determinants. The determinants are divided into three main hierarchies which include customers, regulators, and environment-based factors. Survey was conducted to rank each of the determinants within the hierarchy to validate the need for RegTech services. It is observed that customer-centric experience, enhancing data security and ensuring real-time data capabilities play the major factors for the implementation of RegTech services that is validated by constructing an AHP model. The need for RegTech's determinants would help financial institutions, regulators, and stakeholders in the UAE benefit from the research and achieve competitive advantage by understanding and implementing the suggested findings.

In Latin America, platformisation has resulted in the widespread reorganisation of business practices across many sectors, with important implications for incumbent industries, labour and social processes. These changes raise questions about the potential contributions of platformisation to national economic health and social welfare. This paper argues that the link between platformisation and development can be studied from a developmental state point of view. Specifically, in Latin America, the disruptions caused by platform innovations create policy windows that could result in platform developmental policy innovations, however, developmental policy-making is constrained by the structural characteristics of Latin American economies. Taking this into consideration, the paper positions Biber et al.’s (2017) model of policy disruption, and Fairfield’s (2015) model of policy influence as tools to critically assess platform policymaking from a developmentalist point of view. This approach is illustrated through a survey and discussion of policy disruptions caused by platformisation in the transportation, lodging and fintech sectors of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. The discussion surfaces specific challenges for platform developmentalism related to policy autonomy and capture, societal mobilisation of data and other resources, and state-market collaborations. The paper concludes by positioning the ‘platform society’ as a normative goal and offers an agenda to advance it through comparative research of platform policymaking. © 2020, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

We would like to examine the experiences of technology integration applied to the regulation of the markets and to the compliace, in the banking sector in Italy. Our paper responds to a gap in literature that on the subject of regtech is mainly based on legal, defining arguments and about reviewing the literature on the macro context and the issues generated by the huge amount of regulation. The article will explore three cases of RegTech companies in Italy presenting advantages and criticalities in the adoption of regtech solutions on the Italian market. Methods/Approach: Today the literature about case study in RegTech is not proposing any solution of cooperation on the regulatory field in Italy. So we have to fill the gap we find in exploration of literature. An analysis in the field cannot be separated from a preliminary systematic review of the literature on regulatory case studies. We begin our scientific analysis of the subject through a preliminary literature review individuating any case study around RegTech through exploratory case study. Due to the scarcity of papers about case study in RegTech field, we adopt an approach already used for well-studied cases widespread in the FinTech area and an exploratory investigation through in deep interviews following models used in FinTech area and in ERM field. Results/Findings: In this article, we will, therefore, propose case studies in the FinTech sector applied to regulatory technology in Italy and we expect to answer the following research questions: We present three RegTech's cases in Italy's financial system exposing the fields of collaboration with financial institutions in RegTech field between incumbents and RegTech industries. We expose also how big I.T. companies, which are providing services for banks, are refocusing and improving compliance through RegTech to provide services linked to compliance, Kyc, Aml, privacy, payments to the incumbents. In conclusion we express topics interested by cooperation between banks and RegTech companies describing the potetial expansion lines. Implications: Understand how financial companies through regulatory technology can: Improve risk management and governance in financial institutions. Improve prudential compliance, anti money laundering and customer protection. Reduce the risks of traditional banking business through better knowledge and customer identification and profiling may also offer more favourable terms to companies and lowering compliance costs to shift economic resources towards FinTech's disruptive innovation. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The fundamental purpose of the regulatory sandbox is to facilitate the development of fintech, especially the ‘disruptive innovation’ activities of the start-up enterprises. In this sense, the regulatory sandbox is a sub-category of the regulation of fintech. Fintech is technology-enabled financial innovation, synonymous with the term ‘internet finance’ in the Chinese context. A different but related term, the regulatory technology (regtech), in a broad sense refers to a combination of the ‘compliance technology’ by the market players with the ‘regulatory technology’ by the regulators. In nature, the regulatory sandbox is conditional, limited, and controlled deregulation. It was primarily a reaction to the somehow overly burdensome regulatory requirements after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), thus leaving a ‘lifeline’ for financial innovation and, in particular, fintech. The situation is very different in China, where the major problem for internet finance it not over-regulation but under-regulation. With a vast territory, diversified areas, and numerous institutions, China does not feature a much developed and high concentrated financial market like that of the UK, Singapore, or the HK SAR. Nor does it have an integrated financial regulatory system. And, most importantly, the existing mechanisms in China are capable of performing equivalent or even more functions than the sandbox, which, if copied in China, would be redundant. In short, the regulatory sandbox is admittedly a remarkable innovation in terms of regulatory ideas and approaches conducive to financial innovation, especially fintech. However, with its specific background, exterior conditions, and intrinsic limitations, it is by no means an inevitable choice or universal model for the regulation of fintech. Based on the actual circumstances, it’s not desirable for China to introduce the sandbox, at least for the time being. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Adaptive regulation; Disruptive innovation; Financial technology (fintech); Regulatory sandbox; Regulatory technology (regtech)",,"Liao, F.; Institute of International Law, China; email: liaofan@cass.org.cn",25201875,,,"Perspect.

However, a gap in research effort between practitioners and academics seems to have emerged. This paper analyses and maps that gap by exploring trends in peer-reviewed research contributions through thematic categorisation of academic literature on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) use-cases for services, operations and functions performed by central banks. Furthermore, this paper provides summaries of opportunities and challenges for central banks arising from blockchain adaptation to each of those use-cases. To achieve this goal, we utilise a Systematic Mapping Study approach. The paper presents an in-depth assessment of statistical and thematic analysis of research maturity and the types of researchers, with specific emphasis on types of central bank use-cases considered for blockchain adaptation. Our work contributes to an understanding of where the most or least attention is directed, allowing for identification of gaps and opportunities for both academics, practitioners and combinations of each. Results show that the research topic is a comparatively new domain. It confirms the gap between depth and volume of the research provision from industry and academia, with industry leading the trend.

The Islamic FinTech area has been classified into three broad categories of the Islamic FinTech, Islamic Financial technology opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. Finally, the study identifies and highlights the opportunities and challenges that Islamic Financial institutions can learn from the conventional FinTech organization across the world. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study collected 133 research studies (50 from Social Science Research Network (SSRN), 30 from Research gate, 33 from Google Scholar and 20 from other sources) in the area of Islamic Financial Technology. The study presents the systematic review of the above studies. Findings: The study classifies the Islamic FinTech into three broad categories namely, Islamic FinTech opportunities and challenges, Cryptocurrency/Blockchain sharia compliance and law/regulation. The study identifies that the sharia compliance related to the cryptocurrency/Blockchain is the biggest challenge which Islamic FinTech organizations are facing. During our review we also find that Islamic FinTech organizations are to be considered as partners by the Islamic Financial Institutions (IFI's) than the competitors. If Islamic Financial institutions want to increase efficiency, transparency and customer satisfaction they have to adopt FinTech and become partners with the FinTech companies. Practical Implications: The study will contribute positively to the understanding of Islamic Fintech for the academia, industry, regulators, investors and other FinTech users.

In addition, the study used secondary data to explore the current opportunities and education of universities in the field of Fintech; and the projects and researches in this field, which emerged with new technological developments in universities. Websites on the financial departments of universities in the GCC, data from the national education Ministry of the concerned countries were also examined.The findings reveal thatnone of the universities in the GCC is included in the top 10 leaders in Fintech/crypto education. Despite there are a sufficientnumber of finance departments and centers of research, most universities in the GCC have inappropriate education systems for preparing professional staff working in the Fintech sector. Furthermore, the training process is also not making the necessary progress for this industry to join the international race in this field. Approaches of education are still traditional and behind the advancement of others, there is classic methods of learning and education techniques with no real connection with technology. We conclude that each educated individual in the GCC has to think about Fintech in light of the fact that it may be one of the world's most significant advancements in the near future.

Moreover, highly volatile financial markets and heterogeneous data sets within and across banks world-wide make near real-time financial analytics very challenging and their handling thus requires cutting edge financial algorithms. However, due to a lack of data modeling standards, current financial risk algorithms are typically inconsistent and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of a real-world use case for performing large-scale financial analytics leveraging Big Data technology. We first provide detailed background information on the financial underpinnings of our framework along with the major financial calculations. Afterwards we analyze the performance of different parallel implementations in Apache Spark based on existing computation kernels that apply the ACTUS data and algorithmic standard for financial contract modeling. The major contribution is a detailed discussion of the design trade-offs between applying user-defined functions on existing computation kernels vs. partially re-writing the kernel in SQL and thus taking advantage of the underlying SQL query optimizer. Our performance evaluation demonstrates almost linear scalability for the best design choice. © 2019, The Author(s).","Financial analytics; Performance evaluation; Query processing; User-defined functions",,"Stockinger, K.; Zurich University of Applied Sciences, Technikumstrasse 9, Switzerland; email: Kurt.Stockinger@zhaw.ch",21961115,,,"J.

The empirical research demonstrates how the systemic characteristics of Blockchain banking relate to the pursuit of strategies and to what extent these strategies influence the directional path and level of technology diffusion. Design/methodology/approach: The research study uses a case study methodology to explore the strategic competition of Blockchain banking. The study proposes the systemic innovation model for analysing and tracking the path of innovations. The model can be applied to any industry to understand the process of innovation development and the strategies to win market share in the banking industry. This research makes a contribution towards the theory of technology diffusion to understand the directional path of innovations. Findings: The analyses of findings reveal the situation whereby most banks still compete to create their own Blockchain banking systems. The analyses, based on the systemic innovation model, also shows the low systemic feature of Blockchain banking at present. From the technology diffusion perspective, the future of Blockchain banking may need cross-chain interoperability to support a full spectrum of payments and value exchanges on the internet of things. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is the systemic analysis of the latest innovation of Blockchain banking. Given that the research also includes the major banking innovation cases of ATM/cash cards, credit cards and electronic fund transfer at the point of sale/debit cards, the comparative analyses offer strategic insights to predict the progress, as well as pattern of technology development and diffusion for the case of Blockchain banking. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blockchain; Diffusion; Innovation; Strategy",,"Wonglimpiyarat, J.; Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, United States; email: jaruneew@mit.edu",14636689,,,"Foresight",Article,"Final","",Scopus

They deliver advice at low costs and they are growing in popularity. However, the nature of the interaction between client and machine raises many legal questions under the applicable EU regulation. This article argues that robo-advisers provide investment advice within the meaning of the Second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFiD2). They are subject to authorisation by the national regulator and ongoing conduct requirements. It might be tempting to introduce regulatory sandboxes to address the persisting legal uncertainties in practice, but such a regulatory change does not seem likely in the near future. Instead, regulatory arbitrage should be reduced by a uniform application of the MiFiD2 framework throughout the EU. Regulators and courts should also be aware that software replacing human advisers diverges from the basic idea of human interaction that forms the basis of contract law. Investment firms are able to use new technology in the services they provide. However, as this means introducing new risks for investors, the investment firm should be subject to a strict liability regime for failures of the respective technology (for example, the unavailability of the service). © 2019 De Gruyter.

One of the main drivers of digital economy development is the financial sector which takes the second place after telecommunication companies by investments into innovative informational and communicational technologies. An innovative form of the financial institution is analyzed in the article - challenger bank, which presupposes doing bank business only in the form of remote approach, with the help of mobile communication channels. This for of the financial institution has appeared not long ago and, therefore, it is insufficiently investigated, for which reason the analysis of a corresponding credit organization is of vital importance. One of the main tasks, when exploring innovation projects, is presented by evaluation of economic efficiency of their activity. As a challenger bank is, in fact, a financial institution which can be presented in the form of an information-communication system, that's why methods of estimating IT-projects can be applied to it which will make it possible to evaluate its efficiency from the point of view of making investments into information system. On the basis of this supposition, a model of estimating efficiency of this form of a credit organization as an IT-project has been suggested, where dependency of the net present value on the number of clients growth of the digital financial institution and the number of operations performed by them has been explored.

At the same time, identification and know-your-customer rules can be major barriers to accessing financial services. This paper considers the various requirements for identification in the financial sector and the evolving nature of identity. We argue that technology presents an opportunity to solve this challenge through the development of digital identity infrastructure and related utilities. The establishment of such utilities requires addressing design questions such as registration methods, data availability, and cross-jurisdiction recognitions. Yet, as with any reform, a balance between flow through efficiency and cyber-security needs to be reached to ensure that the objectives of financial inclusion and market integrity are not achieved to the detriment of financial stability. © 2019, T.M.C.

In recent decades, there has been growing societal awareness of the public interest in whistleblowing and the personal, professional and financial toll endured by those who expose wrongdoing. Regulators have taken notice, with an increasing number of jurisdictions enacting whistleblower protections laws. These developments have coincided with rapid technological innovation. Orthodox communication technologies along with big data, artificial intelligence and blockchain are beginning to have a dramatic effect on the nature of whistleblowing. The rise of data transparency has enabled technology to replace whistleblowers by algorithmically preventing and detecting misconduct. Technology is also supporting traditional human whistleblowers, by providing secure and anonymous channels for disclosure. Finally, technology is altering the nature of whistleblowers and whistleblower protections, including by blurring the distinction between whistleblowers, hackers and leakers.

The promise of speedy calculations, massive data processing and accurate predictions are too tempting to pass up for an industry in which almost all actors proceed exclusively instructed by a profit maximising logic. Hence, the strong mathematical prerequisites of financial decisionmaking give rise to the question: Why do financial markets require a human element anyway? The question is largely of a rhetorical nature due to the lack of complexity of most current AI tools. However, AI tools have been used in finance since the early 1990s and the push to overcome faulty computing and other shortcomings has been palpable ever since. Digitalization has amplified efforts and possibilities. Institutions with business models based on AI are entering the market by the hundreds; banks and insurers are either spinning off their AI expertise to foster its growth or paying billions to acquire expertise. There is no way around AI-at least in certain parts of the financial markets. This article outlines the developments concerning the application of AI in the financial markets and discusses the difficulties pertaining to its sudden rise. It illustrates the diverse fields of application (Sect. 1) and delineates approaches, which major financial regulators are taking towards AI (Sect. 2).

These include a wide array of tools to mitigate risks arising from the distinct risk factors that are further consolidated under the risk strategy of a specific enterprise. Any firm in space industry and outside of it faces risks that can be associated with the following key areas: strategic, reputational, regulatory, financial, operational, and cyber. Integrating high tech solutions into the risk mitigation process has now become available by implementing solutions based on artificial intelligence technology. Recent advances in risk management are numerous and include regulatory technology (RegTech) and financial technology (FinTech) solutions that are necessary in the competitive environment. Conservative risk mitigation methods are not fast paced enough to conduct numerous iterations in a split second timeframe and tackle arising risks. For instance, the new regulatory framework design for the company will be more efficient if it grounds on the RegTech concept. The latter automates the state-of-the-art risk mitigation methods and allows for integrating human expertise and newest technology. All in all, better governance and information management are key in the strategic risk management of any enterprise.

The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.","Bank; Banking; Financial market; Financial services; FinTech accelerators; FinTech company; Innovative financial technologies",,,17286220,,,"Eco.

A new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy. At the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses. However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers’ rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology.

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Business models; Financial services; FinTech; Future research direction; RegTech; Regulation",,,01486195,,JEBUD,"J.

Through our research, we have learned much more about the practice and implementation of innovation. For example, we have discovered that innovation is most successful if there is leadership support for a culture of innovation combined with systematic approaches to embed and reinforce innovative behaviours. This article outlines a case study of an organization in the financial services industry who began their innovation journey a number of years ago, and reports on the progress of a sustained and deliberate approach. This research highlights the relationship between an innovation cultural assessment model and its utilization as a framework to manage the implementation of activities to support the development of an innovation approach in a context specific scenario. A case study methodology was adopted that utilized an innovation culture model as a measurement tool. By actively observing the organization, including two cultural assessments over a 4-year period, the findings indicate that an innovation assessment model is useful as an approach to advance the innovation agenda in the organization. In this sense, the research findings are of interest to academics looking to conceptualize a broader implementation framework that is closely associated to the innovation measure associated with the organization. As well, practitioners looking to advance their innovation platforms will find the framework useful as they plan initiatives aimed at advancing their innovation agendas. © 2018 Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

This would be achieved by sharing certain elements of the dynamic transaction document on a bearer service, based on a federation of distribution ledgers; such a quasi-simultaneous sharing of risk data becomes possible because the dynamic transaction document maintain a record of state in semi-real time, and this state can be verified by anybody with access to the distribution ledgers, also in semi-real time. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a novel, regular technology (RegTech) cum automated legal text approach for financial transaction as well as financial risk reporting that is based on cutting-edge distributed computing and decentralised data management technologies such as distributed ledger (Swanson, 2015), distributed storage (Arner et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2013; Caron et al., 2014), algorithmic financial contract standards (Brammertz and Mendelowitz, 2014; Breymann and Mendelowitz, 2015; Braswell, 2016), automated legal text (Hazard and Haapio, 2017) and document engineering methods and techniques (Glushko and McGrath, 2005). This approach is equally inspired by the concept of the “bearer service” and its capacity to span over existing and future technological systems and substrates (Kavassalis et al., 2000; Clark, 1988). Findings: The result is a transformation of supervisors’ capacity to monitor risk in the financial system based on data which preserve informational content of financial instruments at the most granular level, in combination with a mathematically robust time stamping approach using blockchain technology. Practical implications: The RegTech approach has the potential to contain operational risk linked to inadequate handling of risk data and to rein in compliance cost of supervisory reporting. Originality value: The present RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and supervisory reporting is the first integration of algorithmic financial data standards with blockchain functionality. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Algorithmic standards; Document engineering; RegTech; Smart contracts",,"Kavassalis, P.; Panepistemio AigaiouGreece; email: pkavassalis@atlantis-group.gr",15265943,,,"J.

Big Data is driving a trend towards behavioral optimization and ""personalized law,"" in which legal decisions and rules are optimized for best outcomes and where law is tailored to individual consumers based on analysis of past data. Big Data, however, has serious limitations and dangers when applied in the legal context. Advocates of Big Data make theoretically problematic assumptions about the objectivity of data and scientific observation. Law is always theory-laden. Although Big Data strives to be objective, law and data have multiple possible meanings and uses and thus require theory and interpretation in order to be applied. Further, the meanings and uses of law and data are indefinite and continually evolving in ways that cannot be captured or predicted by Big Data. Due to these limitations, the use of Big Data will likely generate unintended consequences in the legal system. Large-scale use of Big Data will create distortions that adversely influence legal decision-making, causing irrational herding behaviors in the law. The centralized nature of the collection and application of Big Data also poses serious threats to legal evolution and democratic accountability. Furthermore, its focus on behavioral optimization necessarily restricts and even eliminates the local variation and heterogeneity that makes the legal system adaptive.

The ban, accompanied by the Board's failure to solicit external expertise, severely limits the success of the Board's actions on judicial review, its institutional competency, and its ability to assess the economic effects of its labor regulation in achieving a central goal of the National Labor Relations Act: Equal bargaining power between workers and their employers that secures competitive wages and increases worker purchasing power. This Article proposes the reestablishment of a Division of Economic Research at the NLRB to integrate the study, analysis, and propagation of labor-related social science into the Board's enforcement and policymaking. In doing so, it draws on the history of the Board's short-lived Division of Economic Research (1935 to 1940) and on the broader development and incorporation of economic and social scientific expertise into the administrative state to consolidate best practices for a new Division. Rejecting the development of expertise through interagency working groups and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs review as insufficient, the Article provides the first roadmap of its kind on how a new internal ""think tank"" could integrate micro-And macroeconomic analysis into the Board's labor regulation. The work of a new Division would not only develop and hone the Board's ability to achieve the Act's goals through rulemaking and adjudication, but it would also enhance the standing of the Board before the courts and the Board's ability to contribute to national debates on how to fight inequality and reverse the dramatic decline of labor's share of national income relative to capital.",,,"Hafiz, H.; University of ChicagoUnited States",0043650X,,,"Wis.
