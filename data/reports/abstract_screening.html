            <p>This study investigates the millennials and gen z perception toward FINTECH services, their usage intention, and their financial behavior. <br> Millennials are more aware (48%) of FINTECH services than gen z (38%), which is different from the global view where gen z is the highest. <br> These clear indicators are the main FINTECH drivers to promote FINTECH services in palestine, and these are global indicators for FINTECH adoption intention. <br> Half of the respondents see that FINTECH plays a complementary role with banks. <br> The majority see that FINTECH services are cheaper than bank services. <br> The authors revealed that 85% of respondents from both generations trust banks, so it is recommended that banks digitize their financial services to meet the customers' needs, considering that 90% of respondents see that promotions are a key issue in adopting FINTECH services. <br> Promoting e-wallet services by banks is highly recommended due to the massive rivalry with FINTECH parties.</p>

            <p>Although FINTECH subject has been highly discussed by the financial institutions in all around the world, there are only a few studies on how banks should draw a framework for FINTECH integration. <br> In this research, we are aiming to draw a framework by using business experience in kuveyt turk participation bank in turkey to give guidance to other financial institutions in FINTECH integration process. <br> This study contains entire FINTECH integration process from revealing the needs of the internal departments to the completion of FINTECH integration. <br> We divided FINTECH integration process into seven phases. <br> Third phase, FINTECH makes presentation for introduction and explains its business model. <br> At the end of this meeting, relevant bank employees evaluate the presentation and decide whether to invite FINTECH again for business committee or not. <br> Fourth phase, FINTECH enters business committee to make presentation for vice presidents of the relevant departments. <br> Fifth phase, FINTECH meets with it, compliance and legal departments to discuss and solve problems. <br> Lastly, in seventh phase, FINTECH integration comes alive for the customer use.</p>

            <p>Inadequate frameworks in FINTECH markets create regulatory friction and regulatory fragmentation. <br> The danger of eu member states being left behind in the FINTECH innovation race if the regulatory landscape is cumbersome or incomplete for new business models is real. <br> Regulatory lag and regulatory friction also act as a disenabler for ease of cross-border FINTECH trade in the eu. <br> This article critically engages with the manner in which the regulatory sandbox has rapidly gained critical mass in member states as a valuable adaptive measure supporting a route to market for FINTECH entrepreneurs. <br> Against the backdrop of the european commissions digital finance strategy, the article further advances scholarship on FINTECH in the eu by probing the eus resulting regulatory dilemma, undertaking a systematic evaluation of the continuum of complex policy options available to the european union in response to the spreading regulatory sandbox phenomenon.</p>

            <p>Purpose: FINTECH is having a profound impact in sub-saharan africa (ssa) because it offers more financial inclusion. <br> In this paper, the authors examine the interrelationship of FINTECH, base of the pyramid (bop) entrepreneurs and social value creation, particularly in the ssa context. <br> The authors interviewed respondents from the sierra leone FINTECH association and four bop entrepreneurs operating in different sectors. <br> Findings: the authors find that FINTECH services, specifically mobile money, play a significant role in reducing uncertainty surrounding business operations. <br> FINTECH also offers growth possibilities for bop entrepreneurs and creates social value by providing transactional security, convenience and reducing physical cash robberies. <br> At the same time, FINTECH contributes to social value by enhancing bop entrepreneurs as well as consumers' skills development. <br> Research limitations/implications: this study highlights the importance of context-specific theorization when analyzing the interlinkage between bop entrepreneurship, social value creation and FINTECH. <br> For example, the possibility of safety from a street robbery may not appear to be part of social value creation by a technological development like FINTECH. <br> Hence, scholars need to incorporate contextual elements of risk, uncertainty and volatility while theorizing on FINTECH's application in bop contexts. <br> FINTECH offers entrepreneurs the possibility to be in regular contact with customers and evaluate their purchasing patterns as well as emergent needs. <br> FINTECH offers bop entrepreneurs a possibility to further develop their technological skills as learning to use such apps can be used as a basis for further skills development. <br> From a policy perspective, our study highlights the importance of regulating FINTECH charges so that the affordability is increased, which is expected to result in significantly more bop entrepreneurs using these services. <br> Social implications: the authors find that at the same time, FINTECH contributes to social value by enhancing skills development of bop consumers who interact with case firms. <br> Originality/value: this paper is one of the first studies that specifically focuses on bop entrepreneurship and social value creation by FINTECH services in an ssa context. <br> It is also one of the few studies that incorporates views from both entrepreneurs and the country's FINTECH association, rather than focusing solely on either entrepreneurs or FINTECH firms.</p>

            <p>FINTECH and digital financial services involve the delivery of financial products and services through technology. <br> FINTECH companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to big banks, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor. <br> For many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in kenya, FINTECH is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid. <br> While refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of FINTECH as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the global north to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support. <br> Through FINTECH, private citizens and groups in the global north are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion. <br> While FINTECH remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans. <br> This paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through FINTECH are still distinguished largely by exclusion.</p>

            <p>We investigate how the emergence of FINTECH start-ups and their financing is shaped by regional knowledge creation and lack of trust in financial services incumbents across 21 oecd countries, 226 regions and over the 20072014 period. <br> We find that knowledge generated in the it sector is much more salient for fostering new FINTECH start-ups than knowledge generated in the financial services sector. <br> Additionally, the importance of new knowledge created in the financial services sector (it sector) increases (decreases) as FINTECH start-ups grow and seek financing. <br> When the level of trust in financial services incumbents falls within a region, this is followed by an increase in the financing provided to FINTECH start-ups. <br> Nevertheless, regions with historically low average levels of trust in financial services incumbents attract less FINTECH investment overall.</p>

            <p>The expansion of FINTECH credit around the world is challenging the global banking system. <br> This study investigates the interrelationships between the development of FINTECH credit and the efficiency of banking systems in 80 countries from 2013 to 2017. the findings indicate a two-way relationship between them. <br> More specifically, a negative relationship between bank efficiency and FINTECH credit implies that FINTECH credit is more developed in countries with less efficient banking systems. <br> Meanwhile, a positive impact of FINTECH credit on the efficiency of banking systems suggests that FINTECH credit may serve as a wake-up call to the banking system. <br> Therefore, FINTECH credit should be encouraged by the authorities around the world.</p>

            <p>While both concepts have been researched in recent years, their intersection, often conceived as green FINTECH, remains underdetermined. <br> Therefore, this paper contributes to this important discussion about green FINTECH by, first, synthesizing the relevant literature systematically. <br> Second, it shows the results of an empirical, in-depth analysis of the swiss FINTECH landscape both in terms of green FINTECH startups as well as the services offered by the incumbents. <br> The research results show that literature in this new domain has only emerged recently, is mostly characterized by a specific focus on isolated aspects of green FINTECH and does not provide a comprehensive perspective on the topic yet. <br> In addition, the results from the literature and the market analysis indicate that green FINTECH has an impact along the whole value chain of financial services covering customertocustomer (c2c), businesstocustomer (b2c), and businesstobusiness (b2b) services.</p>

            <p>Purpose: the aim of the paper is to develop the approach to a legal definition of FINTECH. <br> Design/methodology/approach: in this paper we evolve possible approaches of FINTECH legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels. <br> Findings: we found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address FINTECH companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and FINTECH operators. <br> In our opinion, no specific legislation for FINTECH companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc. <br> Practical implications: the term FINTECH is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally. <br> According to international organizations such as the imf, the world bank and the oecd, FINTECH offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries. <br> Some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for FINTECH and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment. <br> Originality/value: there is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of FINTECH among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area. <br> The value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of FINTECH by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way.</p>

            <p>Despite high expectations for the growth of FINTECH, it has not reached the expected growth in the real world. <br> As FINTECH is innovative but inherently unpredictable, customers are still hesitant to adopt and use FINTECH, which ultimately affects its growth. <br> To achieve the sustainable development and growth of FINTECH, an in-depth investigation of FINTECH continuance intentions is required. <br> To investigate continuous-use behavior in a FINTECH context, this study focuses on two relevant issues: uncertainty and information technology (it) quality. <br> Uncertainty is more critical in FINTECH than in traditional e-banking transactions because FINTECH transactions are complicated and less predictable. <br> It quality is also crucial to FINTECH success because it plays a key role in FINTECH transactions. <br> This study mainly explores the relationship between uncertainty and it quality, both of which significantly affect FINTECH continuance intentions. <br> For the purpose, we integrated an it quality-based perspective with a trust-based model to investigate FINTECH continuance intentions. <br> Service quality is the most important quality factor for controlling uncertainty and encouraging continued use of FINTECH. <br> We found a more extended role of it in FINTECH than in other digital services. <br> This study provides FINTECH providers with the practical guidance in the design and implementation of FINTECH innovation, thereby achieving the sustainable development of FINTECH.</p>

            <p>The integration of the financial industry and financial technology (FINTECH) plays a pivotal role in increasing financial services reach and inclusion for the large unbanked population in indonesia. <br> FINTECH adoption optimization expands the financial access to formal financial institutions, especially to vulnerable groups such as the unbanked population who predominantly reside in rural areas far from formal financial institutions. <br> FINTECH is viewed as a game changer to bring finance to the unreached communities via information technology and digital financial landscape. <br> In this causal research, data collection was done via online questionnaires to 485 FINTECH users between december 2020 and april 2021. data analysis and path modelling was performed using smartpls 3.0 software. <br> Result shows user innovativeness as a significant predictor, directly and indirectly affecting the adoption of FINTECH in indonesia, while user attitude found the most important factor towards FINTECH adoption. <br> Financial literacy is the least important variable to predict FINTECH adoption, contrary to popular belief. <br> This indicates that FINTECH usage requires less financial literacy and is potential to reach unbanked population and those with low financial literacy. <br> To make FINTECH more inclusive, the government needs to accelerate improving information and communications technology (ict) infrastructure such as widening mobile broadband penetration and soft infrastructure by encouraging FINTECH startup, allowing regulatory sandbox for startups, and driving financial institutions to innovate through FINTECH to bring financial services to unbanked population.</p>

            <p>The development of digital transformation has also clearly triggered the emergence of FINTECH (financial technology) initiatives, which are recognized as some of the most important innovations in the financial industry. <br> However, research in the field of FINTECH remains in its infancy. <br> FINTECH offers several services, such as funding, payment (including electronic wallets), e-aggregators, e-trading, and e-insurance, and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. <br> Using the systematic literature review approach of kitchenham, in addition to thematic analysis, meta-analysis and observation to validate the quality of literature and analysis, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis FINTECH research from an information systems perspective, including the formulation of FINTECH technology concepts and their development.</p>

            <p>Financial technology (FINTECH) is a growing industry in indonesia, supported by advances in the technological infrastructure. <br> At the end of 2019, the financial services authority (ojk), the financial authority in indonesia, recorded 164 registered and licensed FINTECH (p2p lending) companies. <br> However, since early 2018, the investment alert task force (swi) and the ministry of communication and information technology have blocked 1,350 illegal FINTECH platforms. <br> Illegal FINTECH lending practices have mechanisms beyond the responsibility and authority of the ojk, including the risk of collection and distribution of personal data. <br> The essence of this study is to discuss the landscape of FINTECH p2p lending in indonesia from indonesian online news data, explore cases of FINTECH p2p lending in indonesia, and understand the rules and policies. <br> Qualitative research with a case study approach and focus group discussion techniques were used to obtain data from 4 stakeholders in the FINTECH p2p lending industry in indonesia. <br> The research found the keyword clusters most frequently discussed in the indonesian online news collection and five case themes such as public awareness about p2p lending (user understanding), data leakage, and restriction of data access, including personal data protection, personal data fraud, illegal FINTECH lending, and product marketing ethics.</p>

            <p>Financial ecosystems are transforming around new financial technology, or FINTECH. <br> From interviews with FINTECH startups in sweden and with venture capitalist firms investing in FINTECH startups in sweden, we explore the intertwined quests for organizational legitimacy in a transforming financial ecosystem. <br> As swedish FINTECH startups seek to establish a sense of their legitimacy, simultaneously incumbents seek to maintain and repair their organizational legitimacy. <br> Adopting a legitimacy-based view of strategic alliances, we set out the aspects of organizational legitimacy that incumbents and FINTECH startups look for in a potential partner and how these aspects meet the legitimacy needs of each partner. <br> We argue that alliances further enhance the organizational legitimacy of both FINTECH startups and incumbents.</p>
