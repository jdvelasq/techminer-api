https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/infographic/2018-04/rts-infographic_april%202018.pdf, the principle of strong customer authentication is to ensure customer protection via an increased level of security when conducting electronic payments. the customers identity must be verified using at least two of the following items: (1) knowledge  something only the user knows (eg pin, password)
(2) possession  something only the user possesses (eg a card, a mobile phone)
and (3) inherence: something the user is (biometric identification like fingerprint, iris or voice recognition etc). for all remote internet and mobile transactions there is an extra element: a unique authentication code which dynamically links the transaction to a specific amount and specific payee. for more information, see: european payments council (2018) understanding the final regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication under psd2, accessed 16th november, 2018

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a32018r0389, the role of the regulatory technical standard (rts) on strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication is to define specific security measures that were only addressed through general principles in psd2, and to ensure effective and secure communication between the relevant stakeholders. these measures are directly applicable in eu member states and do not have to be transposed into national law. the rts has been drafted by the european banking authority and has been adopted by the commission. see: european commission (2018) commission delegated regulation (eu) 2018/389 of 27 november 2017 supplementing directive (eu) 2015/2366 of the european parliament and of the council with regard to regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication, accessed 16th november, 2018

a combination of the words regulatory and technology, a regtech platform (or company)uses new technologies, such as big data, cloud-based services, blockchain or artificial intelligence, to support efficient regulatory management via it. regtech services enable the flexibility and speed required for implementing multiple regulations in an efficient way via standardised approaches
