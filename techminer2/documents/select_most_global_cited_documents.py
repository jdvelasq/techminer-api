   Disruption, and Transformation in Financial Services

PY 2018
AB the FINANCIAL_SERVICES_INDUSTRY has been experiencing the RECENT_EMERGENCE
   of NEW_TECHNOLOGY_INNOVATIONS and PROCESS_DISRUPTIONS . the INDUSTRY_OVERALL
   , and many FINTECH start_ups are looking for NEW_PATHWAYS to
   SUCCESSFUL_BUSINESS_MODELS , the creation of enhanced CUSTOMER_EXPERIENCE ,
   and approaches that result in SERVICES_TRANSFORMATION . INDUSTRY and
   ACADEMIC_OBSERVERS believe this to be more of a revolution than a SET of
   less INFLUENTIAL_CHANGES , with FINANCIAL_SERVICES as a whole due for
   MAJOR_IMPROVEMENTS in EFFICIENCY , CUSTOMER_CENTRICITY , and informedness .
   the long_standing dominance of leading firms that are not able to figure out
   how to effectively hook up with the FINTECH_REVOLUTION is at stake . we
   present a NEW_FINTECH_INNOVATION MAPPING approach that enables the
   assessment of the extent to which there are changes and transformations in
   four areas of FINANCIAL_SERVICES . we discuss : OPERATIONS_MANAGEMENT in
   FINANCIAL_SERVICES and the changes occurring . TECHNOLOGY_INNOVATIONS that
   have begun to leverage the execution and STAKEHOLDER_VALUE associated with
   PAYMENTS , CRYPTOCURRENCIES , BLOCKCHAIN , and cross_border PAYMENTS .
   MULTIPLE_INNOVATIONS that have affected LENDING and DEPOSIT_SERVICES ,
   peer_to_peer ( P2P ) LENDING , and SOCIAL_MEDIA_USE . issues with respect to
   INVESTMENTS , FINANCIAL_MARKETS , TRADING , RISK_MANAGEMENT , robo_advisory
   and SERVICES influenced by BLOCKCHAIN and FINTECH_INNOVATIONS .
