Imagine that you are a researcher analyzing a bibliographic dataset. The table below provides data on top 20 organizations with highest number of published documents ('OCC' indicates 'occurrences'). Use the the information in the table to draw conclusions about the document production by organization. In your analysis, be sure to describe in a clear and concise way, any findings or any patterns you observe, and identify any outliers or anomalies in the data. Limit your description to one paragraph with no more than 250 words.
